The tool provides a drag and drop interface to create graphical routines in virtual worlds; these routines are automatically translated into code to provide a real-time or offline enactment on mobile robots in the real world. This paper summarizes the key capabilities of Dorothy, and describes the contributions made to: (a) enhance the bidirectional communication between the virtual interface and robots; and (b) support multirobot collaboration. Specifically, we describe the ability to automatically revise the virtual world based on sensor data obtained from robots, creating or deleting objects in the virtual world based on their observed presence or absence in the real world. Furthermore, we describe the use of visually observed behavior of teammates for collaboration between robots when they cannot communicate with each other. Dorothy thus helps illustrate sophisticated algorithms for fundamental challenges in robotics and AI to teach advanced computing concepts, and to emphasize the importance of computing in real world applications, to beginning programmers.",10

In addition to pushing the limits of consumer grade components at low cost, SB is a focal point for interdisciplinary student projects spanning computer science, engineering, and physics. We demonstrate that undergraduate students can engage in rich, long-term robotic design and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) from both hardware and software perspectives. Student outcomes of SB include senior theses, conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and admission to graduate programs. Students who participated also report substantial development in skills and knowledge applicable to their post-undergraduate education and careers.",2

We describe the variety of materials made available by IBM, as well as the nature of the competition and the datasets that are at the heart of it. We detail how, where and in what form we integrated the materials into our course. We describe assignments that are based on the materials from the competition as well as additional materials we incorporated into our course. We finish by evaluating our experience in teaching with the materials as well as summarize relevant student feedback. We make recommendations for those who wish to adopt the materials.",6

The project brings together students from backgrounds in computer science, physics, engineering, and Digital Media Arts (DMA) in an informal educational setting. The platform will be used in AI courses and autism treatment studies.",1

The established approaches for this include either asking a student to present a paper in class, or to have the entire class read and discuss a paper. However, neither of these approaches presents incentives for student participation beyond the posting of a single summary or review. In this paper, we describe a class project that uses the popular Easychair conference management system as a pedagogical tool to enable engagement in the peer review process. We report on the deployment of this project in a medium-sized graduate AI class, and present the results of this deployment. We hope that the success of this project in engaging students in the peer review process can be used better train and bolster the future corps of AI reviewers.",0

West, James Heliotis, Sean Strout, Ivona Bezakova, Bikramjit Banerje, Daniel Thompson","The Model AI Assignments session seeks to gather and disseminate the best assignment designs of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education community. Recognizing that assignments form the core of student learning experience, we here present abstracts of five AI assignments from the 2014 session that are easily adoptable, playfully engaging, and flexible for a variety of instructor needs. Assignment specifications and supporting resources may be found at modelai.gettysburg.edu.",12
