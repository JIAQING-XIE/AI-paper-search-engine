With a trajectory defined in the image space by a sequence of equidistant key images along the glidepath, an interpolation in the homography space is also proposed in order to reduce the database size and ensure the required smoothness of the control task. In addition, a pan-tilt control was taken into account to respect the dynamics of the aircraft during manoeuvres and in the presence of wind perturbations. An optimal control design based on the linearized model of the aircraft dynamics is then consider to cancel the visual error function. To demonstrate the proposed concept, simulation results under realistic atmospheric disturbances are presented.",29

For this purpose, we propose a minimal control strategy for steering flying robots using only communication hardware (e.g. WiFi module or radio modem) instead of GPS or cameras. To avoid being dependent on the specifics of the communication hardware or its driver, we propose to measure the number of messages the robot receives from the base as a control input. Leashing is then performed by having the robot react to low message rates by moving towards the base in order to improve the communication. Results show both in theory and reality that this strategy can leash the robot to the base in scenarios with limited wind or base mobility.",17

A crucial point is the localization of the vehicle, which is especially difficult in unknown, GPS-denied environments. This paper presents a novel vision based approach, where the vehicle is localized using a downward looking monocular camera. A state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm tracks the pose of the camera, while, simultaneously, building an incremental map of the surrounding region. Based on this pose estimation a LQG/LTR based controller stabilizes the vehicle at a desired setpoint, making simple maneuvers possible like take-off, hovering, setpoint following or landing. Experimental data show that this approach efficiently controls a helicopter while navigating through an unknown and unstructured environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work describing a micro aerial vehicle able to navigate through an unexplored environment (independently of any external aid like GPS or artificial beacons), which uses a single camera as only exteroceptive sensor.",514

Moore,Saul Thurrowgood,Daniel Bland,Dean Soccol,,","This study describes a novel, vision-based system for guidance of UAVs. The system uses two coaxially aligned cameras, each associated with a specially-shaped reflective surface, to obtain stereo information on the height above ground and the distances to potential obstacles. The camera-mirror system has the advantage that it remaps the world onto a cylindrical co-ordinate system that simplifies and speeds up range computations, and defines a collision-free cylinder through which the aircraft can pass without encountering obstacles. We describe an approach, using this vision system, in which the attitude and altitude of an aircraft can be controlled directly, making the system particularly suited to terrain following, obstacle avoidance, and landing. The autonomous guidance of an aircraft performing a terrain following task using the system is demonstrated in field tests.",28

Olivares-Méndez,","This article presents a real time Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs 3D pose estimation method using planar object tracking, in order to be used on the control system of a UAV. The method explodes the rich information obtained by a projective transformation of planar objects on a calibrated camera. The algorithm obtains the metric and projective components of a reference object (landmark or helipad) with respect to the UAV camera coordinate system, using a robust real time object tracking based on homographies. The algorithm is validated on real flights that compare the estimated data against that obtained by the inertial measurement unit IMU, showing that the proposed method robustly estimates the helicopter's 3D position with respect to a reference landmark, with a high quality on the position and orientation estimation when the aircraft is flying at low altitudes, a situation in which the GPS information is often inaccurate. The obtained results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for complex control tasks, such as autonomous landing, accurate low altitude positioning and dropping of payloads.",98

Specifically, we describe the implementation of, and lessons learned from, a multidisciplinary graduate-level course in Architectural Robotics. The results from class interactions and projects provide insight into novel ways in which robotics expertise can be effectively leveraged in architecture. Conversely, our outcomes suggest ways in which the knowledge and perspective of architects could stimulate significant innovations in robotics.",12

Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft has the merits of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Tail-sitting is the simplest way for the VTOL maneuver since it does not need extra actuators. However, conventional hovering control for a tail-sitter UAV is not robust enough against large disturbance such as a blast of wind, a bird strike, and so on. It is experimentally observed that the conventional quaternion feedback hovering control often fails to keep stability when the control compensates large attitude errors. This paper proposes a novel hovering control strategy for a tail-sitter VTOL UAV that increases stability against large disturbance. In order to verify the proposed hovering control strategy, simulations and experiments on hovering of the UAV are performed giving large attitude errors. The results show that the proposed control strategy successfully compensates initial large attitude errors keeping stability, while the conventional quaternion feedback controller fails.",89

Each Sambot can move autonomously and connect with the others. Multiple Sambot can be self-assembled to form a robotic structure, which can be reconfigured into different configurable robots and can locomote. A novel mechanical design is described to realize function of autonomous motion and docking. Introducing embedded mechatronics integrated technology, whole actuators, sensors, microprocessors, power and communication unit are embedded in the module. The Sambot is compact and flexible, the overall size is 80×80×102mm. The preliminary self-assembly and self-reconfiguration of Sambot is discussed, and several possible configurations consisting of multiple Sambot are designed in simulation environment. At last, the experiment of self-assembly and self-reconfiguration and locomotion of multiple Sambot has been implemented.",93

As it approaches a wall, the plane executes an intentional pitch-up maneuver to shed speed and present its feet for landing. On contact, a nonlinear suspension dissipates the remaining kinetic energy and directs interaction forces toward the feet to engage small asperities on surfaces such as brick or concrete. The focus of the work in this paper is on the controller used for sensing a wall and executing vertical landing and take-off procedures and on the mechanisms developed for spine engagement and disengagement.",44

Listak,,,,,","Within the broader scope of underwater biomimetics, in this paper we address the relevance of factors such as shape and elasticity distribution in the ability of a compliant device to imitate the kinematic behaviour of a fish. We assess the viability of myometry as a tool to determine candidate mechanical parameters without relying solely on analytical models; we show that we can obtain elasticity distributions that are both consistent with previous theoretical investigations and experimentally better adherent to the passive kinematics of a biological embodiment (rainbow trout).",11

Chong,Chunlin Zhou,","In this paper, a fish robot employing a carangiform swimming mode is adopted as an experimental platform for the parametric study. Experiments conducted in the laboratory aim to study the variation of robotic fish's thrust with respect to various parameters including the frequency and amplitude of oscillation, joint link, aspect ratio, free flow velocity and the spring effect. The testing also enables us to find out the relationship between various parameters and the thrust generated by the oscillatory motion of tail. On the other hand, the significance of the controlled parameters will be determined using statistical methods.",38

Nelson,","The artificial bacterial flagellum (ABF), a helical swimming microrobot, has the potential to be used for biomedical applications such as cellular and intracellular manipulation. The velocity and the propulsive force of the ABF can be controlled by the input frequency of the rotating magnetic field. In this paper the swimming behavior of the ABF near a solid surface is reported. Three regions have been observed for the frequency-dependent swimming behavior of the ABF, i.e. the step-out, the linear and the drift-dominated region. At low frequencies it has been found that the desired screw-type motion is replaced by a wobbling swimming movement with a frequency-dependent precession angle. Moreover, the experimental results show that the wobbling motion of the ABF enhances the undesired sidewise drift due to wall effects. Additionally, the cause of the precession motion has been investigated by a hydrodynamic model. Our results imply that the linear range of the input magnetic frequency and the output ABF velocity is not only limited by the applicable torque at high frequencies but also by the wobbling of helical swimming at low frequencies.",58
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5509488,Analytical modeling and experimental studies of robotic fish turning,"Xiaobo Tan,Michael Carpenter,John Thon,Freddie Alequin-Ramos,","Turning is one of the most important maneuvers for biological and robotic fish. In our group's prior work, an analytical framework was proposed for modeling the steady turning of fish, given asymmetric, periodic body/tail movement or deformation. However, the approach was not illustrated with simulation or validated with experiments. The contributions of the current paper are three fold. First, an extension to the modeling framework is made with a more rigorous formulation of the force balance equation. Second, we have worked out two examples explicitly, one with an oscillating, rigid tail, and the other with a flexible tail having a uniform curvature, and compared their turning behaviors through numerical results. Third, for model validation purposes, a robotic fish prototype has been developed, with the tail shaft controlled precisely by a servo motor. For a rigid tail, experimental results have confirmed the model prediction that, for the tested range, the steady-state turning radius and turning period decrease with an increasing bias in the tail motion, and that the turning period drops with an increasing tail beat frequency. We have also found that, with a flexible fin attached to the tail shaft, the robot can achieve faster turning with a smaller radius than the case of a rigid fin, and modeling within the same framework is underway to understand this phenomenon.",31

The robot, called Omegabot, is named after the omega (Ω) shape of the crawling motion of the inchworm. This type of inchworm can travel approximately its body length per stroke along rough surfaces, leaf edges, and boughs of trees. The robot is built with smart composite microstructures (SCM), a fabrication method that uses laser micromachining to cut composites and assemble them into micro structures. We suggest a special pattern design for SCM to generate a two-dimensional turning motion, crawling motion, and a proleg design for climbing a tree. The robot is actuated with a shape memory alloy coil actuator activated by a PWM (pulse-width modulation) signal control electric current. As a result, Omegabot can crawl, turn, and grip a tree bough. This robot can be used for search and rescue or gathering useful information in an area where only small-scale robots can penetrate.",58

To reduce the influence of inspected part reflectance property and ambient light, the pattern is constructed by using monochromatic light. The corner of the chessboard is utilized as the primitive of the pattern since it can provide highly accurate position. Additionally, the orientation of the corner is used to encode the primitive of the pattern. Compared with ordinary two dimensional patterns, the pattern is developed in one dimension, along the epipolar line so that the search of the corresponding pixels between the projector and the camera is speeded up. Last, experiments were conducted to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of the inspection system using the proposed pattern. The results demonstrate that the system has high accuracy performance.",13

This research is motivated by the need of obtaining semantic knowledge of a large urban outdoor environment after the robot explores and generates a low-level sensing data set. An algorithm is developed with the data represented in a range image, while each pixel can be converted into a 3D coordinate. Using an existing segmentation method that models only geometric homogeneities, the data of a single object of complex geometry, such as people, cars, trees etc., is partitioned into different segments. Such a segmentation result will greatly restrict the capability of object recognition. This research proposes a framework of simultaneous segmentation and classification of range image, where the classification of each segment is conducted based on its geometric properties, and homogeneity of each segment is evaluated conditioned on each object class. Experiments are presented using the data of a large dynamic urban outdoor environment, and performance of the algorithm is evaluated.",53

The system extracts essential knowledge about the foreground, like moving persons, and the background, which consists of all visible static scene parts. In contrast to other 3D reconstruction approaches, we suggest to additionally distinguish between static parts, like walls, and movable objects like chairs or doors. The discrimination supports the reconstruction process and additionally, delivers important information about interaction objects. Here, the movable object detection is realized object independent by analyzing changes in the scenery. Furthermore, in the proposed system the background scene is feedbacked to the tracking part yielding a much better tracking and detection result which improves again the 3D reconstruction. We show in our experiments that we are able to provide a sound background model and to extract simultaneously persons and object regions representing chairs, doors, and even smaller movable objects.",21

We present here a novel approach that is able to derive a dense motion field based on range images only. We propose to first segment the range image into segments using a recently proposed segmentation criterion. Motion is then estimated segment-wise with full 6 degrees of freedom. To that end, we introduce dynamic mapping, i.e. the accumulation of measurements for moving objects. We show experimentally that the approach is able to deliver a dense motion field which can then be used for object-class independent trajectory estimation.",62

By supplementing a stereo system with a strong texture projector, dropouts can be eliminated or reduced. This paper develops a practical stereo projector system, first by finding good patterns to project in the ideal case, then by analyzing the effects of system blur and phase noise on these patterns, and finally by designing a compact projector that is capable of good performance out to 3m in indoor scenes. The system has been implemented and has excellent depth precision and resolution, especially in the range out to 1.5m.",223

Schmidt-Rohr,Martin Lösch,Rüdiger Dillmann¹,","In Programming by Demonstration, a flexible representation of manipulation motions is necessary to learn and generalize from human demonstrations. In contrast to subsymbolic representations of trajectories, e.g. based on a Gaussian Mixture Model, a partially symbolic representation of manipulation strategies based on a temporal satisfaction problem with domain constraints is developed. By using constrained motion planning and a geometric constraint representation, generalization to different robot systems and new environments is achieved. In order to plan learned manipulation strategies the RRT-based algorithm by Stilman et al. is extended to consider, that multiple sets of constraints are possible during the extension of the search tree.",46

Howard,","In this paper, we discuss a methodology to build a system for a robot playmate that extracts and sequences low-level play primitives during a robot-child interaction scenario. The motivation is to provide a robot with basic knowledge of how to manipulate toys in an equivalent manner as a human does - as a first step in engaging children in cooperative play. Our approach involves the extraction of play primitives based on observation of motion gradient vectors computed from the image sequence. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are then used to recognize 14 different play primitives during play. Experimental results from a data set of 100 play scenarios including child subjects demonstrate 86.88% accuracy recognizing and sequencing the play primitives.",23

Most approaches have focused on building high-level probabilistic cognitive models. However, research in cognitive science shows that people often build common ground for communication with each other by seeking and providing evidence of understanding through behaviors like mimicry. Predictive State Representations (PSRs) allow one to build explicit, low-level models of the expected outcomes of actions, and are therefore well-suited for tasks that require providing such evidence of understanding. Using human-robot shadow puppetry as a prototype interaction study, we show that PSRs can be used successfully to both model human interactions, and to allow a robot to learn on-line how to engage a human in an interesting interaction.",4

The hybrid likelihood function for mapping between continuous hidden states and categorical observations are specified via softmax models. Although softmax models avoid discretization of continuous states, they are challenging to implement for real-time data fusion since they are not analytically integrable. An approximation based on variational Bayesian (VB) methods is presented here to obtain fast closed-form Gaussian solutions to the desired posteriors in cases where the hidden continuous states have Gaussian pdfs. A joint human-robot target localization example illustrates the properties and utility of the VB hybrid fusion strategy, which also applies more generally to inference in hybrid Bayesian networks and mixture models.",17

The system consists of an a-priori (Atlas) knowledge about known generic objects in the scene and classifies the scene into mission relevant objects and background geometry that is important only for collision avoidance. We present the object-centric structure of our system consisting of an Atlas representation and a Working Memory storing the current knowledge about the scene, the manipulated objects and actions applied to them in the local environment. We present experimental results how the system maintains the information in the database and we show the quality of the results that can be obtained with our system.",14

This study describes a novel HMI using Hill-based muscle model to control the isometric force of a robotic thumb that considers the importance of the thumb in hand function. In order to estimate force intension, SEMG from the skin surface was measured and converted to muscle activation information. The activations of deep muscles were inferred from the ratios of muscle activations from earlier studies. The muscle length of each contributed muscle was obtained by using a motion capture system and musculoskeletal modeling software packages. Once muscle forces were calculated, thumb-tip force was estimated based on a mapping model from the muscle force to thumb-tip force. The proposed method was evaluated in comparisons with a linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) under four different thumb configurations to investigate the potential for estimations under conditions in which the thumb configuration changes.",11

Engsberg,","With over 600 thousand people each year surviving a stroke, it has become the leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States [1], [2]. The adverse financial and social conditions attributed to stroke have prompted researchers and entrepreneurs to explore the viability of rehabilitation robots. The Powered Ankle Foot Orthosis (PAFO) utilizes robotic tendon technology and supports motion with a single degree of freedom, ankle rotation in the Sagittal plane. Motion capture data, robot sensor data, and functional 6 minute walk data were collected on three stroke subjects. All subjects had some positive changes in their key gait variables while using the PAFO. These changes were more dramatic while harnessed and using a treadmill as opposed to walking over ground. Robot sensor data showed significant improvements on key variables for the three subjects. Motion capture data showed improvements in knee range of motion for subject 1, and the 6 minute walk data showed an increase in distance walked for subjects 1 and 3. Comfort, stability, and robustness proved to be critical design parameters for developing a gait therapy robot capable of collecting repeatable data with low variability.",44

This paper reports a small dual cohort pilot study with traumatic spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects designed to investigate the utility of the UCF-MANUS for these subjects. Pick-and-place ADL tasks were de÷ned and users trained and tested with the system for three weeks during which they controlled the robot either through a manual or an autonomous (supervised) mode of operation. Baseline characteristics (pre-study), quantitative performance metrics (during study) and psychometrics (post-study) were obtained and statistically analyzed to test a set of hypotheses related to performance and satisfaction with the two control modes. It was seen that manual interaction showed more variability and inef÷ciency in performance metrics as compared to autonomous operation. Suprisingly the latter mode, however, did not lead to better measures for user satisfaction. A discussion is provided to explain the results. Based on qualitative feedback and quantitative results, possible directions for system design are presented in order to concurrently achieve better performance and satisfaction outcomes.",15

Howard,","In this paper, we discuss a coordinated haptic training architecture useful for transferring expertise in teleoperation-based manipulation between two human users. The objective is to construct a reality-based haptic interaction system for knowledge transfer by linking an expert's skill with robotic movement in real time. The benefits from this approach include 1) a representation of an expert's knowledge into a more compact and general form by learning from a minimized set of training samples, and 2) an increase in the capability of a novice user by coupling learned skills absorbed by a robotic system with haptic feedback. In order to evaluate our ideas and present the effectiveness of our paradigm, human handwriting is selected as our experiment of interest. For the learning algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) are utilized and their performances are compared. For the evaluation of the performance of the output of the learning modules, a modified Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) algorithm is implemented. Results show that one or two experts' samples are sufficient for the generation of haptic training knowledge, which can successfully recreate manipulation motion with a robotic system and transfer haptic forces to an untrained user with a haptic device. Also in the case of handwriting comparison, the similarity measures result in up to an 88% match even with a minimized set of training samples.",30

A main prerequisite for a team deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) framework. As team coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and large scale SLAM increasing both efficiency and robustness of operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the problem of single robot SLAM, few extensions to teams of robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present paper we address the problem of multi robot SLAM in the case of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses. Starting from the well established single robot RBPF-SLAM, we propose a simple technique which jointly estimates SLAM posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be naturally extended to different communication technologies (bluetooth, RFId, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range. The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.",117

We propose an approach for sampling particles from multiple ancestor sets, not from just one prior set. This sampling method increases the robustness of SLAM algorithm, because some particles can be updated by only observations consistent with the map, even if observation at certain time step is corrupted by environmental changes. Corrupted observations are filtered out from recursive Bayesian update process by the proposed sampling method. We also present an intermediate path estimation method to use abandoned sensor information reflected from relocated objects for map update. The map can represent the changed configuration of non-static environment by the stored sensor information and the estimated path. Results of simulations and experiments in non-static environments show the robustness of proposed RBPF-SLAM algorithm using sonar sensors.",21

This hybrid representation enables SLAM to be applied in environments with moving objects, where solutions using point features alone are computationally prohibitive or where dense objects e.g. landmasses can not be represented correctly using point features. Estimation is achieved using a sliding window framework with reversible data-association and reversible model-selection. Our main contributions are: (i) a hybrid representation of the environment; (ii) occupancy grid fusion is continually refined for the duration of the sliding window; (iii) the trajectories of dynamic objects are represented using cubic splines and (iv) radar scans are re-rendered at a sub-scan resolution to compensate for the egomotion during the scan acquisition period. We show that the continual refinement of the occupancy grid greatly improves the quality of the resultant map, leading to a better estimate of the egomotion and therefore better estimates of the trajectories of dynamic objects. We also demonstrate that the use of cubic splines to represent trajectories has two major advantages: (i) the state space is compressed i.e. many vehicle poses can be represented using a single spline section and (ii) the trajectory becomes continuous and so fusing information from asynchronous sensors running at multiple frequencies becomes trivial. The efficacy of our system is demonstrated using real marine radar data, showing that it can successfully estimate the positions/velocities of objects and landmasses observed during a typical voyage on a small boat.",55

Wahl,","The capability of solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem is one of the fundamental tasks of mobile robots and many research has focused on this problem over the last decades. In this paper, the SLAM problem is considered as the problem of finding an optimal path through a tree resulting in minimum costs. For this purpose, we apply the Ant Colony Optimization meta-heuristic, which belongs to the class of ant algorithms. It has been successfully employed to solve the well known Traveling Salesman Problem with several thousands of cities. We use a simple scan matching technique for generating a rough pre-solution to the SLAM problem. The (inconsistent) map is partitioned into fragments. A new fragment is initialized as soon as the robot has moved several meters. We draw samples from Gaussian distributions representing alignments of consecutive fragments. The resulting set of samples is interpreted as a tree-like data structure with weights assigned to the edges. We use our own variant of an ant algorithm for finding the optimal path through the tree. Real-world experimental results demonstrate the characteristics of our method.",13

During online mapping, the approach corrects only the coarse structure of the scene and not the overall map. In this way, only updates for the parts of the map that need to be considered for making data associations are carried out. The hierarchical approach provides accurate non-linear map estimates while being highly efficient. Our error minimization approach exploits the manifold structure of the underlying space. In this way, it avoids singularities in the state space parameterization. The overall approach is accurate, efficient, designed for online operation, overcomes singularities, provides a hierarchical representation, and outperforms a series of state-of-the-art methods.",272

To this end we describe the acquisition and modeling of large urban spaces from data that reflects human sensory input. Over 181GB of image and inertial data are captured using head-mounted stereo cameras. This data is processed into a relative map covering 121 km of Southern England. We point out the numerous challenges we encounter, and highlight in particular the problem of undetected ego-motion, which occurs when the robot finds itself on-or-within a moving frame of reference. In contrast to global-frame representations, we find that the continuous relative representation naturally accommodates moving-reference-frames - without having to identify them first, and without inconsistency. Within a moving-reference-frame, and without drift-less global exteroceptive sensing, motion with respect to the global-frame is effectively unobservable. This underlying truth drives us towards relative topometric solutions like relative bundle adjustment (RBA), which has no problem representing distance and metric Euclidean structure, yet does not suffer inconsistency introduced by the attempt to solve in the global-frame.",33

Jakuba,Ian Mahon,,,","This paper describes an approach to achieving high resolution, repeated benthic surveying using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A stereo based Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) technique is used to estimate the trajectory of the vehicle during multiple overlapping grid based surveys. The vehicle begins each dive on the surface and uses GPS to navigate to a designated start location. Once it reaches the designated location on the surface, the vehicle dives and executes a pre-programmed grid survey, collecting co-registered high resolution stereo images, multibeam sonar and water chemistry data. A suite of navigation instruments are used while the vehicle is underway to estimate its pose relative to the local navigation frame. Following recovery of the vehicle, the SLAM technique is used to refine the estimated vehicle trajectory and to find loop closures both within each survey and between successive missions to co-register the dives. Results are presented from recent deployments of the AUV Sirius at a site in North Eastern Tasmania. The objective of the deployments described in this work were to document the behaviour of barrens-forming sea sea urchins which have recently become resident in the area. The sea urchins can overgraze luxuriant kelp beds that once dominated these areas, leaving only rocky barrens habitat. The high resolution stereo images and resulting three dimensional surface models allow the nocturnal behaviour of the animals, which emerge to feed predominantly at night, to be described. Co-registered images and resulting habitat models collected during the day and at night are being analysed to describe the behaviour of the sea urchins in more detail.",36

The proposed RBE, which parallelizes grid-wise computations using GPU upon the analysis of mathematical operations, removes sequential processes and accelerates RBE significantly.

Such methods adapt the coordination method to the dynamic changes in density of the robots. Unfortunately, while their empirical success is evident, none of these methods has been understood in the context of existing formal work on multi-robot learning. This paper presents a reinforcement-learning approach to coordination algorithm selection, which is not only shown to work well in experiments, but is also analytically grounded. We present a reward function (Effectiveness Index, EI), that reduces time and resources spent coordinating, and maximizes the time between conflicts that require coordination. It does this by measuring the resource-spending velocity. We empirically show its success in simulations of multi-robot foraging. In addition, we analytically explore the reasons that EI works well. We show that under some assumptions, spatial coordination opportunities can be modeled as matrix games in which the payoffs are directly a function of EI estimates. The use of reinforcement learning leads to robots maximizing their EI rewards in equilibrium. This work is a step towards bridging the gap between the theoretical study of interactions, and their use in multi-robot coordination.",37

The study provides controllability results for the five most common types of robot vehicles: Dubins, Reeds-Shepp, differential drive, car-like and convexified Reeds-Shepp. The challenge of achieving controllability of such systems is that their admissible control domains depend on configuration variables. A theorem of controllability specifical for such systems has been obtained based on known controllability theorems. As a result, we show that pairs of the latter three types are completely controllable, i.e. can be steered between any two arbitrary configurations. The same does not hold for pairs of Dubins or Reeds-Shepp vehicles, and a description of the reachable sets in these cases is provided. Finally, as direct extension of controllability results of pairs of identical vehicles, the controllability results for two kinds of formation of n identical vehicles are presented.",4

In this work, we propose a method to automatically generate a POMDP representation of an environment. By using variable resolution decomposition techniques, we can take advantage of characteristics of the environment to minimize the number of states required, while maintaining the level of detail required to find a robust and efficient policy. This is accomplished by automatically adjusting the level of detail required for planning at a given region, with few states representing large open areas, and many smaller states near objects.

We argue that the best (if not the only) way to resolve any difficulties that arise from the different requirements at the agent, component and infrastructure levels is to use a common formal logical goal representation for all three layers.

Semantic scene graphs are extracted from image sequences and used to find the characteristic main graphs of the action sequence via an exact graph-matching technique, thus providing an event table of the action scene, which allows extracting object-action relations. The method is applied to several artificial and real action scenes containing limited context. The central novelty of this approach is that it is model free and needs a priori representation neither for objects nor actions. Essentially actions are recognized without requiring prior object knowledge and objects are categorized solely based on their exhibited role within an action sequence. Thus, this approach is grounded in the affordance principle, which has recently attracted much attention in robotics and provides a way forward for trial and error learning of object-action relations through repeated experimentation. It may therefore be useful for recognition and categorization tasks for example in imitation learning in developmental and cognitive robotics.",96

We also present our own single-image object detection method that uses large synthetic datasets for training. Using a distributed, parallel learning algorithm, we train from very large datasets (up to 100 million image patches). The resulting object detector achieves high performance on its own, but also benefits substantially from using multiple camera views.

icra,None,A strategy for improving observability with mobile robots,"Andrew Drenner,Michael Janssen,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","Many surveillance and reconnaissance tasks make use of multi-cameras in order to ensure that a particular mission is accomplished. These networks of cameras are useful as they can reduce the cost of human observers, are continuously observant (unlike humans who may fall asleep on the job), and can be implemented for a fairly low cost. However, in many scenarios, it does not make sense or may not be possible to have a fixed camera installation because the surveillance may only be needed for a short duration or it may take too long to do a proper install and observation is needed now. In terms of short terms and immediacy, mobile robots acting as a camera network provide an interesting middle ground. They can be deployed quickly to cover immediate needs, and they can be packed up and moved to another area if needs change. However, as the duration of the mission in which they are used increases, the robotic team will run out of power. This paper addresses some of the issues with keeping a surveillance team active while their batteries drain.

In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the practical applicability of the most general game theoretical approach for patrolling strategies, called BGA model.

The PDF represents the goal density that would be obtained by sampling a statistically-significant number of sensors from the mixture. However, since a smaller number of sensors may be deployed, and each sensor is represented by a disk, the potential function is generated by multiplying the PDF by a likelihood update model that produces networks with disjoint fields-of-view.

We base our control function on maximisation of expected mutual information gain, which to our knowledge is novel to the field of computer vision in the context of multiple pan-tilt-zoom camera control. This information theoretic measure yields a utility for each goal and parameter setting, making the use of physical or computational resources comparable. Weighting this utility allows to prioritise certain objectives or targets in the control.

We develop a multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) framework that solves the complicated data association and tracking problem for an SMPM of moving objects/targets. Human presence detection utilizes SMPM signal features, which are tested in a classical likelihood ratio (LR) detector framework.

Most approaches to people tracking make weak assumptions on human motion such as constant velocity or acceleration. But even over a short period, human behavior is more complex and influenced by factors such as the intended goal, other people, objects in the environment, and social rules. This motivates the use of more sophisticated motion models for people tracking especially since humans frequently undergo lengthy occlusion events. In this paper, we consider computational models developed in the cognitive and social science communities that describe individual and collective pedestrian dynamics for tasks such as crowd behavior analysis. In particular, we integrate a model based on a social force concept into a multi-hypothesis target tracker. We show how the refined motion predictions translate into more informed probability distributions over hypotheses and finally into a more robust tracking behavior and better occlusion handling. In experiments in indoor and outdoor environments with data from a laser range finder, the social force model leads to more accurate tracking with up to two times fewer data association errors.",309
icra,None,Improvement in listening capability for humanoid robot HRP-2,"Toru Takahashi,Kazuhiro Nakadai,Kazunori Komatani,Tetsuya Ogata,,","This paper describes improvement of sound source separation for a simultaneous automatic speech recognition (ASR) system of a humanoid robot. A recognition error in the system is caused by a separation error and interferences of other sources. In separability, an original geometric source separation (GSS) is improved. Our GSS uses a measured robot's head related transfer function (HRTF) to estimate a separation matrix. As an original GSS uses a simulated HRTF calculated based on a distance between microphone and sound source, there is a large mismatch between the simulated and the measured transfer functions. The mismatch causes a severe degradation of recognition performance. Faster convergence speed of separation matrix reduces separation error. Our approach gives a nearer initial separation matrix based on a measured transfer function from an optimal separation matrix than a simulated one. As a result, we expect that our GSS improves the convergence speed. Our GSS is also able to handle an adaptive step-size parameter. These new features are added into open source robot audition software (OSS) called ""HARK"" which is newly updated as version 1.0.0. The HARK has been installed on a HRP-2 humanoid with an 8-element microphone array.

The open loop frequency response of actuator strain shows characteristics of a first-order low pass filter with a log gain versus log frequency slope near -1 for frequencies tested between 0.05 Hz to 2 Hz. The closed loop frequency response of actuator strain when tracking a sinusoidal set-point signal of 0.5% strain shows characteristics of a first order system with one zero, with a corner frequency near 0.08 Hz and an operating bandwidth up to 1 Hz. Step responses at various controller output maximum voltages show a reduction in contractile response times by a factor of four, where higher voltages yield faster contractile responses.",0
icra,None,Compensation of rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities in a piezo micro-positioning stage,"Mohammad Al Janaideh,Chun-Yi Su,Subhash Rakheja,","Piezo micro-positioning actuators have been widely used in micro-positioning applications due to the fast expansion, high force generation, and unlimited resolution. However, these actuators exhibit some rate-dependent hysteresis effects which affect the accuracy of these micro-positioning systems and may even lead to system instability. In this paper, the rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is employed to characterize the rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezo micro-positioning stage. The analytical inverse of the rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is then formulated using the initial loading curve concept. This inverse is utilized as a feedforward compensator to compensate for the hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezo micro-positioning stage under excitation in the 1-50 Hz frequency range.",13
icra,None,A voice-commandable robotic forklift working alongside humans in minimally-prepared outdoor environments,"Seth Teller,Matthew R. Walter,Matthew Antone,Andrew Correa,,,,,,,,,,,,","One long-standing challenge in robotics is the realization of mobile autonomous robots able to operate safely in existing human workplaces in a way that their presence is accepted by the human occupants. We describe the development of a multi-ton robotic forklift intended to operate alongside human personnel, handling palletized materials within existing, busy, semi-structured outdoor storage facilities. The system has three principal novel characteristics. The first is a multimodal tablet that enables human supervisors to use speech and pen-based gestures to assign tasks to the forklift, including manipulation, transport, and placement of palletized cargo. Second, the robot operates in minimally-prepared, semi-structured environments, in which the forklift handles variable palletized cargo using only local sensing (and no reliance on GPS), and transports it while interacting with other moving vehicles. Third, the robot operates in close proximity to people, including its human supervisor, other pedestrians who may cross or block its path, and forklift operators who may climb inside the robot and operate it manually. This is made possible by novel interaction mechanisms that facilitate safe, effective operation around people. We describe the architecture and implementation of the system, indicating how real-world operational requirements motivated the development of the key subsystems, and provide qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the robot operating in real settings.",86
icra,None,Visual path following on a manifold in unstructured three-dimensional terrain,"Paul Furgale,Tim Barfoot,","This paper describes the design and testing of a technique to enable long-range autonomous navigation using a stereo camera as the only sensor. During a learning phase, the rover is piloted along a route capturing stereo images. The images are processed into a manifold map of topologically-connected submaps that may be used for localization during an autonomous repeat traverse. Path following in non-planar terrain is handled by moving from localization in three dimensions, to path following in two dimensions using a local ground plane associated with each submap. The use of small submaps decouples the computational complexity of route repeating from the length of the path. We validate the algorithm by demonstrating its performance on a difficult three-dimensional route. Using this technique, a rover may autonomously traverse a multi-kilometer route in unstructured, three-dimensional terrain, without an accurate global reconstruction.",13
icra,None,A ZigBee indoor positioning scheme using signal-index-pair data preprocess method to enhance precision,"Min-Hsiung Hung,Shih-Sung Lin,Jui-Yu Cheng,Wu-Lung Chien,","This paper develops a ZigBee indoor positioning scheme based on the location fingerprinting approach. The proposed scheme includes four workflows: (1) creating the location fingerprint table, (2) training the locating model using neural network (NN), (3) preprocessing data through the Signal-Index-Pair method, and (4) estimating the coordinate of the mobile target instantly. Testing results show that within the error distance of 5 meters, the NN locating model with the Signal-Index-Pair data preprocess method can increase the positioning precision by 17% compared with the original NN, in terms of the cumulative error probability (CEP). It also achieves 5% CEP higher than the k (k=5) nearest neighbor method and the weighted k (k=5) nearest neighbor method. Potential applications include patient tracking in hospitals, object tracking for factory monitoring, self-navigation of autonomous robots, and visitors monitoring in military buildings, and so on.",11

icra,None,Statistical mobility prediction for planetary surface exploration rovers in uncertain terrain,"Genya Ishigami,Gaurav Kewlani,Karl Iagnemma,","Planetary surface exploration rovers must accurately and efficiently predict their mobility on natural, rough terrain. Most approaches to mobility prediction assume precise a priori knowledge of terrain physical parameters, however in practical scenarios knowledge of terrain parameters contains significant uncertainty. In this paper, a statistical method for mobility prediction that incorporates terrain uncertainty is presented. The proposed method consists of two techniques: a wheeled vehicle model for calculating vehicle dynamic motion and wheel-terrain interaction forces, and a stochastic response surface method (SRSM) for modeling of uncertainty. The proposed method generates a predicted motion path of the rover with confidence ellipses indicating the probable rover position due to uncertainty in terrain physical parameters. Rover orientations and wheel slippage are also predicted. The computational efficiency of SRSM as compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods is shown via numerical simulations. Experimental results of rover travel over sloped terrain in two different uncertain terrains are presented that confirms the utility of the proposed mobility prediction method.",31
icra,None,"Navigation and control of the Nereus hybrid underwater vehicle for global ocean science to 10,903 m depth: Preliminary results","Louis L. Whitcomb,Michael V. Jakuba,James C. Kinsey,Stephen C. Martin,,,,,,","This paper reports an overview of the navigation and control system design for the new Nereus hybrid underwater robotic vehicle (HROV). Vehicle performance during its first sea trials in November 2007 near Hawaii, and in May and June 2009 in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench is reported. During the latter expedition, the vehicle successfully performed scientific observation and sampling operations at depths exceeding 10,903 m. The Nereus underwater vehicle is designed to perform scientific survey and sampling to the full depth of the ocean - significantly deeper than the depth capability of all other present-day operational vehicles. For comparison, the second deepest underwater vehicle currently operational worldwide can dive to 7,000 m maximum depth. Nereus operates in two different modes. For broad-area survey, the vehicle can operate untethered as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of exploring and mapping the sea floor with sonars and cameras. Nereus can be converted at sea to become a tethered remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to enable close-up imaging and sampling. The ROV configuration incorporates a lightweight fiber-optic tether (for high-bandwidth, real-time video and data telemetry to the surface), an electro-hydraulic manipulator arm, and sampling instruments. The Nereus vehicle is designed to render all parts of the Earth's seafloor accessible to oceanographic science.",52
icra,None,New method of modeling the actuation dynamics of a miniature hingeless helicopter using gyroscopic moments,"Tak Kit Lau,Yun-hui Liu,Kai-wun Lin,","For years, the puzzling cross-coupled responses between the control axes on the hingeless helicopters have long been haunting researchers. Different from previous works that underestimated the gyroscopic moments as a minor off-axis cross-coupling and misinterpreted the precession phenomena on the rotors of the hingeless helicopters as a phase-lag which is physically meaningless, this paper proposes a new method to relate both on-axis and off-axis responses by the influential gyroscopic moments through the actuation mechanism of the hingeless helicopters. Therefore, by this new method the debatable cross-coupling due to actuation dynamics can be directly and analytically quantified. This method is based on the fact that when the angular momentum of the spinning rotor is disturbed by the incremental lift along the main blades due to the varying cyclic pitch angle controlled by the servo mechanisms, the off-axis moments are induced to counteract the changes of the angular momentum according to the principle of gyroscope, and hence these gyroscopic moments directly exhibit the on-axis responses. This new method yields a parametric framework to examine the previously unexplained cross-coupled responses on the hingeless helicopters, and it shows that in hingeless helicopters except the aerodynamics the intricate nonlinearities are also attributed to their unintuitive actuation mechanisms. Finally, simulations as well as experiments have been carried out to validate the proposed modeling method.",4

icra,None,Design of an improved land/air miniature robot,"Alex Kossett,Ruben D'Sa,Jesse Purvey,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","Small ground robots remain limited in their locomotion capabilities, often prevented from accessing areas restricted by tall obstacles or rough terrain. This paper presents the improved design of a hybrid-locomotion robot made to address this issue. It uses wheels for ground travel and rotary-wing flight for scaling obstacles and flying over rough terrain. The robot's initial design suffered from a number of issues that prevented it from functioning fully, such as overheating motors, inadequate control electronics, and insufficient landing gear. Several improvements have been made to the robot's design to correct these problems. These obstacles, and the solutions implemented in the improved design, have enabled several design principles to be formulated for miniature hybrid-locomotion robots. It is found that hybrid-locomotion vehicles utilizing rotary-wing flight are most useful when the design is optimized for ground mode performance. Collapsibility is necessary in such vehicles to reduce the impact of the helicopter rotor on the size of the ground mode. Finally, since a large number of actions are necessary to propel and transform the robot, integrating multiple functions into each mechanism can reduce the mass of the robot.",16

icra,None,Integrated controller for an over-constrained cable driven parallel manipulator: KNTU CDRPM,"Alaleh Vafaei,Mohammad M. Aref,Hamid D. Taghirad,","This paper presents an approach to the control of the KNTU CDRPM using an integrated control scheme. The goal in this approach is achieving accurate trajectory tracking while assuring positive tension in the cables. By the proposed controller, the inherent nonlinear behavior of the cable and the target tracking errors are simultaneously compensated. In this paper asymptotic stability analysis of the close loop system is studied in detail. Moreover, it is shown that the integrated control strategy reduces the tracking error by 80% compared to that of a single loop controller in the considered manipulator. The closed-loop performance of the control topology is analyzed by a simulation study that is performed on the manipulator. The simulation study verifies that the proposed controller is not only promising to be implemented on the KNTU CDRPM, but also being suitable for other cable driven manipulators.",29
icra,None,Optimization strategies for additional actuators of kinematically redundant parallel kinematic machines,"Jens Kotlarski,Trung Do Thanh,Bodo Heimann,Tobias Ortmaier,","In this paper five different optimization strategies for kinematically redundant mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms having additional actuator(s) in at least one kinematic chain, are presented. They are based on two main approaches, a discrete optimization and a classical continuous optimization. Exemplarily, a planar, kinematically redundant 3RRR-based mechanism is introduced. The position of its redundant actuator, i.e. the robot geometry, is optimized according to an optimization criterion that is denoted as the gain of the maximal homogenized pose error. Several analysis examples demonstrate the effectiveness of kinematic redundancy with respect to the introduced optimization procedures. It is shown that in comparison to discrete approaches, classical continuousbased optimization strategies do not necessarily lead to more appropriate results in terms of performance improvement.",47

However, not many useful practical applications using low-mobility parallel mechanisms having 4-DOF and 5-DOF have been developed. In this paper, we propose a 4-DOF parallel mechanism for needle insertion application in which proper orientation and needle insertion process are required. The mechanism has four outer chains and one passive middle chain through which a needle insertion motion occurs. The kinematic modeling and kinematic analysis are performed to understand the characteristics of this mechanism. Through the singularity analysis, a singularity-free design for the desired workspace is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of this device as a needle insertion device is shown through experimental work.",0
icra,None,Enhanced trajectory tracking control with active lower bounded stiffness control for cable robot,"Kun Yu,Leng-Feng Lee,Chin Pei Tang,Venkat N. Krovi,","Cable robots have seen considerable recent interest ensuing from their ability to combine a large workspace with significant payload capacity. However, the cables can apply forces to the end-effector only when they are in tension, and thus form a subclass of control problems requiring unilateral control inputs. Furthermore, actuation redundancy occurs when surplus cables are introduced within the system. On one hand, such redundancy needs to be carefully resolved for accurate tracking of the task. On the other hand, it allows the redistribution of the actuation forces to satisfy some secondary criteria. In this paper, we apply such redundancy for enhanced trajectory tracking by actively controlling the task stiffness of the end-effector. The scheme allow us to specify a lower bound of the task stiffness, which is intended to provide improved trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection performance. Finally, we illustrate the improved control performance within a virtual prototype cosimulation framework.",27

icra,None,Sidewinding on slopes,"Ross L. Hatton,Howie Choset,","Sidewinding is an efficient translation gait used by snakes over flat ground. When implemented on snake robots, it retains its general effectiveness, but becomes unstable on sloped surfaces. Flattening the sidewinding motion along the surface to provide a more stable base corrects for this instability, but degrades other performance characteristics, such as efficiency and handling of rough terrain. In this paper, we identify stability conditions for a sidewinder on a slope and find a solution for the minimum aspect ratio of the sidewinding pattern needed to maintain stability. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments on snake robots. In constructing our stability analysis, we present a new, tread-based model for sidewinding that is both consistent with previous models and provides new intuition regarding the kinematics of the gait. This new interpretation of sidewinding further admits a symmetry-based model reduction that simplifies its analysis. Additionally, an intermediate stage of the theoretical work contains a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of an ellipse in rolling contact with a sloped surface.",49

Finally, in order to demonstrate the validity of the optimal shape that minimizes the evolution index, simulations have been carried out.",2

In prior research most of ACM were composed of straight links and joints, and a lot of successful control methods for them have been proposed. However, the control of the ACM that is composed of arc-shaped joints or double joints has not been studied sufficiently so far.

icra,None,"An adaptive decentralized control of a serpentine robot based on the discrepancy between body, brain and environment","Takahide Sato,Wataru Watanabe,Akio Ishiguro,","Despite its appealing concept, a systematic way of designing autonomous decentralized control system is still lacking. In order to alleviate this, we have so far proposed a design scheme for local sensory feedback control leading to adaptive behaviors from the entire system, based on a so-called discrepancy function that extracts the discrepancies between body (i.e., mechanical system), brain (i.e., control system) and environments. This paper intensively investigates the validity of this design scheme under the real world constraints by taking a two-dimensional serpentine robot exhibiting undulatory slithering locomotion as a practical example. The experimental results show that the robot exhibits adaptive behavior against environmental changes as well as the robustness against malfunctions of body segments due to the local sensory feedback control.

We decompose the action selection problem during the search into two parts. First, we compute a belief over the location of the object and subsequently use the belief to select the next target location the robot should visit. For the inference part, we utilize a maximum entropy model which models the conditional distribution over possible locations of the target object given the observations made so far. The model is based on co-occurrences of objects and object attributes in different spatial contexts. The parameters are learned by maximizing the data likelihood using gradient ascent. We evaluate our approach by simulated search runs based on data obtained from different real-world environments. Our results show a significant improvement over a standard search technique which does not employ domain-specific background knowledge.",23

Ng,","Although robot navigation in indoor environments has achieved great success, robots are unable to fully navigate these spaces without the ability to operate elevators, including those which the robot has not seen before. In this paper, we focus on the key challenge of autonomous interaction with an unknown elevator button panel. A number of factors, such as lack of useful 3D features, variety of elevator panel designs, variation in lighting conditions, and small size of elevator buttons, render this goal quite difficult. To address the task of detecting, localizing, and labeling the buttons, we use state-of-the-art vision algorithms along with machine learning techniques to take advantage of contextual features. To verify our approach, we collected a dataset of 150 pictures of elevator panels from more than 60 distinct elevators, and performed extensive offline testing. On this very diverse dataset, our algorithm succeeded in correctly localizing and labeling 86.2% of the buttons. Using a mobile robot platform, we then validate our algorithms in experiments where, using only its on-board sensors, the robot autonomously interprets the panel and presses the appropriate button in elevators never seen before by the robot. In a total of 14 trials performed on 3 different elevators, our robot succeeded in localizing the requested button in all 14 trials and in pressing it correctly in 13 of the 14 trials.",43
icra,None,"Design, fabrication, and implementation of self-sealing suction cup arrays for grasping","Chad C. Kessens,Jaydev P. Desai,","Suction cups have long been used as a means to grasp and manipulate objects. They enable active control of grasp, enhance grasp stability, and handle some objects such as large flat plates more easily than standard graspers. However, the application of suction cups to object manipulation has been confined to a relatively small, well-defined problem set. Their potential for grasping a large range of unknown objects remains relatively unexplored. This seems in part due to the complexity involved with the design and fabrication of various materials comprising the grasper as well as actuators used to enable grasping. This paper introduces the design of a suction cup that is “self-selecting.” In other words, the suction cups comprising the grasper do not exert any suction force when the cup(s) are not in contact with the object, but instead exert a suction force only when they are in physical contact with the object. Since grasping is achieved purely by passive means, the cost and weight associated with individual sensors, valves, and/or actuators are essentially eliminated. Furthermore, the design permits the use of a central vacuum pump, thereby maximizing the suction force on an object and enabling some suction on surfaces that may prohibit tight seals. This paper presents the design, analysis, fabrication, and experimental results of such a “self-selecting” suction cup array.",17

The novel robotic finger concept supports these insights by combining three key features: minimal actuation, variable mechanical compliance and full manipulability. This combination of features allows for a minimal component design, while reducing control complexity and still providing required dexterity and grasping capabilities.

Second-order conic friction constraints are not linearized, as in many previous works. The force distributions are smooth and rapidly computable, and they enable flexibility in selecting between firm, stable grasps or looser, more efficient grasps. Furthermore, fingers can be disengaged and re-engaged in a smooth manner, which is a critical capability for a large number of manipulation tasks.

The finger is realized in plastic material by means of 3D-printing, a production process that allows a remarkable simplification of the mechanical design. Through 3D-printing, we were able to easily implement solutions that could be very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain with conventional manufacturing. A detailed simulation model of the robotic finger has been developed with the aim not only of designing and testing suitable control strategies for the finger, but also of investigating the benefits and the flaws of particular design solutions. As a matter of fact, this approach to design and realization of robotic fingers, that fulfills the requirements in terms of compactness, integration and simplified assembly, has a significant drawback in frictional phenomena on both tendons and joints. For this reason, an adapted LuGre friction model is proposed in order to simulate and study the finger behavior.",37
icra,None,Design of Redundant Drive Joints with Double Actuation using springs in the second actuator to avoid excessive active torques,"Kiyoshi Nagai,Yuichiro Dake,Yasuto Shiigi,Rui C. V. Loureiro,William S. Harwin,","This paper discusses the design of a Redundant Drive Joint with Double Actuation (RDJ-DA) to produce controlled compliant motions over a higher bandwidth. First, our strategies on mechanical and controller designs to produce compliant motions are described, and the basic structure and impedance control of the RDJ-DA with internal serial structure explained. The standard form of the basic structure is introduced using a set of parameters which can be used to express the inertia property of RDJ-DA. Second, a problem statement for the design of RDJ-DAs is described after pointing out that required torques of the second actuator of the RDJ-DA could be large. Then, a basic idea of introducing springs into the second actuator in parallel is proposed as a part of the structural design of RDJ-DA to reduce the large torques. Simulations are conducted to find out a set of the design parameters of RDJ-DA which obtains a higher natural frequency of the output joint admittance satisfying both the desired output joint admittance and the limitations of two identical motors on their performance. Finally, a prototype design of RDJ-DA using the obtained set of the design parameters is presented.",12
icra,None,Safe joint mechanism using inclined link with springs for collision safety and positioning accuracy of a robot arm,"Jung-Jun Park,Jae-Bok Song,","In recent years, the potential for collision between humans and robots has drawn much attention since service robots are increasingly being used in the human environment. A safe robot arm can be achieved using either an active or passive compliance method. A passive compliance system composed of purely mechanical elements often provides faster and more reliable responses to dynamic collision than an active system involving sensors and actuators. Since positioning accuracy and collision safety of a robot arm are equally important, a robot arm should have very low stiffness when subjected to a collision force capable of causing human injury. Otherwise, it should maintain a very high stiffness. To implement these requirements, a novel safe joint mechanism (SJM-III) consisting of an inclined link, a slider with rollers, and linear springs is proposed. The SJM-III has the advantage of nonlinear stiffness, which can be achieved only with passive mechanical elements. Various analyses and experiments on static and dynamic collisions show high stiffness of the SJM-III against an external torque less than a predetermined threshold torque, with an abrupt drop in stiffness when the external torque exceeds this threshold. The safe joint mechanism enables a robot manipulator to guarantee positioning accuracy and collision safety, and which is simple to install between an actuator and a robot link without a significant change in the robot's design.",40
icra,None,A control strategy for operating unknown constrained mechanisms,"Ewald Lutscher,Martin Lawitzky,Gordon Cheng,Sandra Hirche,",This work aims at the development of a versatile control strategy for operating unknown mechanically constrained devices such as drawers or doors. Few assumptions on the device's shape as well as the utilized hardware are required. Our approach is based on an on-line estimation of the constraint manifold which serves as a reference input for an admittance-type controller providing the compliance required. The direction estimation is obtained from the velocity signal in task space. An on-line adaptation of the admittance controller according to the estimated moving direction reduces contact forces. The functionality of the control strategy is demonstrated on a mobile manipulator in a kitchen environment.,28
icra,None,Resonance-based task space controller for multi-joint robot with adjustable equilibrium angle of elastic element,"Mitsunori Uemura,Sadao Kawamura,","This paper proposes a task space trajectory tracking controller based on resonance for multi-joint robots. This controller generates desired motions, which are specified in the task space, while adjusting stiffness of mechanical elastic elements installed in each joint of the robots. This controller also adjusts equilibrium angles of the elastic elements. These parameter adjustments minimize actuator torque. Advantages of the proposed controller are to work without using exact parameter values of the controlled systems nor huge numerical calculations. We mathematically discuss stability of the controlled systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",1
icra,None,An Electric Field Pretouch system for grasping and co-manipulation,"Brian Mayton,Louis LeGrand,Joshua R. Smith,","Pretouch sensing is longer range than contact, but shorter range than vision. The hypothesis motivating this work is that closed loop feedback based on short range but non-contact measurements can improve the reliability of manipulation. This paper presents a grasping system that is guided at short range by Electric Field (EF) Pretouch. We describe two sets of experiments. The first set of experiments involves human-to-robot and robot-to-human handoff, including the use of EF Pretouch to detect whether or not a human is also touching an object that the robot is holding, which we call the “co-manipulation state.” In the second set of experiments, the robot picks up standalone objects. We describe a number of techniques that servo the arm and fingers in order to both collect relevant geometrical information, and to actually perform the manipulation task.",78
icra,None,Learning and planning high-dimensional physical trajectories via structured Lagrangians,"Paul Vernaza,Daniel D. Lee,Seung-Joon Yi,","We consider the problem of finding sufficiently simple models of high-dimensional physical systems that are consistent with observed trajectories, and using these models to synthesize new trajectories. Our approach models physical trajectories as least-time trajectories realized by free particles moving along the geodesics of a curved manifold, reminiscent of the way light rays obey Fermat's principle of least time. Finding these trajectories, unfortunately, requires finding a minimum-cost path in a high-dimensional space, which is generally a computationally intractable problem. In this work we show that this high-dimensional planning problem can often be solved nearly optimally in practice via deterministic search, as long as we can find a certain low-dimensional structure in the Lagrangian that describes our observed trajectories. This low-dimensional structure additionally makes it feasible to learn an estimate of a Lagrangian that is consistent with the observed trajectories, thus allowing us to present a complete approach for learning from and predicting high-dimensional physical motion sequences. We finally show experimental results applying our method to human motion and robotic walking gaits. In doing so, we furthermore demonstrate efficient path planning in a 990-dimensional space.",3
icra,None,Movement templates for learning of hitting and batting,"Jens Kober,Katharina Mülling,Oliver Krömer,Christoph H. Lampert,,,","Hitting and batting tasks, such as tennis forehands, ping-pong strokes, or baseball batting, depend on predictions where the ball can be intercepted and how it can properly be returned to the opponent. These predictions get more accurate over time, hence the behaviors need to be continuously modified. As a result, movement templates with a learned global shape need to be adapted during the execution so that the racket reaches a target position and velocity that will return the ball over to the other side of the net or court. It requires altering learned movements to hit a varying target with the necessary velocity at a specific instant in time. Such a task cannot be incorporated straightforwardly in most movement representations suitable for learning. For example, the standard formulation of the dynamical system based motor primitives (introduced by Ijspeert et al. [1]) does not satisfy this property despite their flexibility which has allowed learning tasks ranging from locomotion to kendama. In order to fulfill this requirement, we reformulate the Ijspeert framework to incorporate the possibility of specifying a desired hitting point and a desired hitting velocity while maintaining all advantages of the original formulation. We show that the proposed movement template formulation works well in two scenarios, i.e., for hitting a ball on a string with a table tennis racket at a specified velocity and for returning balls launched by a ball gun successfully over the net using forehand movements. All experiments were carried out on a Barrett WAM using a four camera vision system.",164
icra,None,Machine-learning based control of a human-like tendon-driven neck,"Lorenzo Jamone,Matteo Fumagalli,Giorgio Metta,Lorenzo Natale,,,","This paper describes the control of a human-like robotic neck actuated with tendons. The controller regulates the length of the tendons to achieve a desired orientation of the neck and at the same time it maintains the tension of the tendons within certain limits. The solution we propose does not use any model of the system, but it relies on online learning of the different Jacobian mappings required by the controller. Learning, data acquisition and control are simultaneous; thus learning is completely autonomous, and purely online. We show that after enough iterations the controller produces straight trajectories in the task space and is able to maintain the tension of the tendons within safe limits.",20
icra,None,Behavior recognition for Learning from Demonstration,"Erik A. Billing,Thomas Hellström,Lars-Erik Janlert,","Two methods for behavior recognition are presented and evaluated. Both methods are based on the dynamic temporal difference algorithm Predictive Sequence Learning (PSL) which has previously been proposed as a learning algorithm for robot control. One strength of the proposed recognition methods is that the model PSL builds to recognize behaviors is identical to that used for control, implying that the controller (inverse model) and the recognition algorithm (forward model) can be implemented as two aspects of the same model. The two proposed methods, PSLE-Comparison and PSLH-Comparison, are evaluated in a Learning from Demonstration setting, where each algorithm should recognize a known skill in a demonstration performed via teleoperation. PSLH-Comparison produced the smallest recognition error. The results indicate that PSLH-Comparison could be a suitable algorithm for integration in a hierarchical control system consistent with recent models of human perception and motor control.",26
icra,None,Learning of probabilistic grasping strategies using Programming by Demonstration,"Rainer Jäkel,Sven R. Schmidt-Rohr,Zhixing Xue,Martin Lösch,Rüdiger Dillmann,","The planning of grasping motions is demanding due to the complexity of modern robot systems. In Programming by Demonstration, the observation of a human teacher allows to draw additional information about grasping strategies. Rosell showed, that the motion planning problem can be simplified by globally restricting the set of valid configurations to a learned subspace. In this work, the transformation of a humanoid grasping strategy to an anthropomorphic robot system is described by a probabilistic model, called variation model, in order to account for modeling and transformation errors. The variation model resembles a soft preference for grasping motions similar to the demonstration and therefore induces a non-uniform sampling distribution on the configuration space. The sampling distribution is used in a standard probabilistic motion planner to plan grasping motions efficiently for new objects in new environments.",18
icra,None,"An integrated probabilistic model for scan-matching, moving object detection and motion estimation","Joop van de Ven,Fabio Ramos,Gian Diego Tipaldi,","This paper presents a novel framework for integrating fundamental tasks in robotic navigation through a statistical inference procedure. A probabilistic model that jointly reasons about scan-matching, moving object detection and their motion estimation is developed. Scan-matching and moving object detection are two important problems for full autonomy of robotic systems in complex dynamic environments. Popular techniques for solving these problems usually address each task in turn disregarding important dependencies. The model developed here jointly reasons about these tasks by performing inference in a probabilistic graphical model. It allows different but related problems to be expressed in a single framework. The experiments demonstrate that jointly reasoning results in better estimates for both tasks compared to solving the tasks individually.",27
icra,None,A segmentation guided label propagation scheme for autonomous navigation,"Soumya Ghosh,Jane Mulligan,","Navigating through unknown outdoor environments requires a robot to be able to see and model the far field terrain. In recent years this problem of seeing beyond reliable stereo readings into the far field has gained attention. Many proposed solutions involve using near field obstacle and ground plane regions labeled using stereo, to learn models which classify far field image regions. In this work we offer an alternative which exploits coherent image regions as determined by image segmentation to propagate obstacle and ground labels from the near and mid field to the image far field. Rather than relying on local features to classify individual pixels we model and compare appearance across the whole segment. New labels are determined by proximity in both image space and appearance space. Since both traversable and non-traversable surfaces can vary in appearance across the image, our approach has the advantage that each labeled segment acts as a distinct appearance model, which allows us to label similar neighbours. We evaluate our system using a publicly available dataset and compare its performance to a typical learning-based near-to-far labeling scheme.",8
icra,None,A real-time pedestrian detection system based on structure and appearance classification,"Mayank Bansal,Sang-Hack Jung,Bogdan Matei,Jayan Eledath,,","We present a real-time pedestrian detection system based on structure and appearance classification. We discuss several novel ideas that contribute to having low-false alarms and high detection rates, while at the same time achieving computational efficiency: (i) At the front end of our system we employ stereo to detect pedestrians in 3D range maps using template matching with a representative 3D shape model, and to classify other background objects in the scene such as buildings, trees and poles. The structure classification efficiently labels substantial amount of non-relevant image regions and guides the further computationally expensive process to focus on relatively small image parts; (ii)We improve the appearance-based classifiers based on HoG descriptors by performing template matching with 2D human shape contour fragments that results in improved localization and accuracy; (iii) We build a suite of classifiers tuned to specific distance ranges for optimized system performance. Our method is evaluated on publicly available datasets and is shown to match or exceed the performance of leading pedestrian detectors in terms of accuracy as well as achieving real-time computation (10 Hz), which makes it adequate for in-vehicle navigation platform.",36
icra,None,Homography-based ground plane detection for mobile robot navigation using a Modified EM algorithm,"D. Conrad,G. N. DeSouza,","In this paper, a homography-based approach for determining the ground plane using image pairs is presented. Our approach is unique in that it uses a Modified Expectation Maximization algorithm to cluster pixels on images as belonging to one of two possible classes: ground and non-ground pixels. This classification is very useful in mobile robot navigation because, by segmenting out the ground plane, we are left with all possible objects in the scene, which can then be used to implement many mobile robot navigation algorithms such as obstacle avoidance, path planning, target following, landmark detection, etc. Specifically, we demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our approach by applying it to a target following algorithm. As the results section shows, the proposed algorithm for ground plane detection achieves an almost perfect detection rate (over 99%) despite the relatively higher number of errors in pixel correspondence from the feature matching algorithm used: SIFT.",54

icra,None,DisCoverage: A new paradigm for multi-robot exploration,"A. Dominik Haumann,Kim D. Listmann,Volker Willert,","The main aspect in multi-robot exploration is the efficient coordination of a group of robots. Inspired by previous results on the coverage problem, we propose a novel, frontier-based approach for multi-robot exploration. This approach merges the step of choosing appropriate target points with the step of planning a collision-free path. This is achieved by optimizing an objective function consisting of distance and orientation costs as well as an estimated information gain. The optimization yields motion control laws directly solving the exploration task. Using a Voronoi partition of the environment ensures, that each robot autonomously creates and optimizes the objective function to obtain a collision-free path in a distributed fashion. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",51
icra,None,A duality approach to path planning for multiple robots,"Nader Motee,Ali Jadbabaie,George Pappas,","In this paper, we propose an optimization-based framework for path planning for multiple robots in presence of obstacles. The objective is to find multiple fixed length paths for multiple robots that satisfy the following constraints: (i) bounded curvature, (ii) obstacle avoidance, (iii) and collision avoidance. First, we formulate a relaxation of the path planning problem using polygonal approximations. We show that path planning problem for multiple robots under various constraints and missions, such as curvature and obstacle avoidance constraints as well as rendezvous and maximal total area coverage, can be cast as a nonconvex optimization problem. Then, we propose an alternative dual formulation that results in no duality gap. We show that the alternative dual function can be interpreted as minimum potential energy of a multi-particle system with discontinuous spring-like forces. Finally, we show that using the proposed duality-based framework, an approximation of the minimal length path planning problem (also known as Dubins' problem) in presence of obstacles can be solved efficiently using primal-dual interior-point methods.",6

icra,None,Blinkered LOST: Restricting sensor field of view can improve scalability in emergent multi-robot trail following,"Seyed Abbas Sadat,Richard T. Vaughan,","We consider the classical task of transporting resources from source to home by a group of autonomous robots. The robots use ant-like trail following to navigate between home and source. This paper studies the effect on global performance of changing the field of view of each robot's trail-following sensor. It is shown that, under certain conditions, a narrow field of view can improve system performance. We argue that the benefit is obtained by selectively degrading the individuals' trail-following ability so that more work space is exploited in parallel, thus decreasing mutual spatial interference. This “worse-is-better” idea may be applicable to other large-scale multi-robot systems.",10
icra,None,Multi-agent path planning with multiple tasks and distance constraints,"Subhrajit Bhattacharya,Maxim Likhachev,Vijay Kumar,","The DPC algorithm developed in our previous work is an efficient way of computing optimal trajectories for multiple robots in a distributed fashion with time-parameterized constraints on the distances between pairs of robots. In the present work we extend DPC to the problem of multiple task execution. While this extended problem inherits all the objectives, complexities and constraints of the basic DPC algorithm, each robot is also given an unordered set of tasks that it has to execute before it reaches its goal. There is no specific order imposed on the tasks assigned to a particular robot. The algorithm decides the order of execution of the tasks such that an optimal solution is attained while the time-parametrized distance constraints are satisfied along with successful execution of the tasks. We solve this problem by designing a “State-task Graph” that represents a product of the state-space graph and the task graph. We then develop an efficient heuristic function for performing searches in this graph.",59

Successful and efficient operation in such environments requires reasoning about the future system evolution and the uncertainty associated with obstacles and moving agents in the environment. This paper presents a novel procedure to account for future information gathering (and the quality of that information) in the planning process. After first presenting a formal Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation, we present a Partially Closed-loop Receding Horizon Control algorithm whose approximation to the DP solution integrates prediction, estimation, and planning while also accounting for chance constraints that arise from the uncertain location of the robot and other moving agents. Simulation results in simple static and dynamic scenarios illustrate the benefit of the algorithm over classical approaches.",96
icra,None,A receding horizon controller for motion planning in the presence of moving obstacles,"Bin Xu,Daniel J. Stilwell,Andrew J. Kurdila,","We address the minimal risk motion planning problem in a two dimensional environment in the presence of both moving and static obstacles. Our approach is inspired by recent results due to Vladimirsky in which path planning on time-varying maps is addressed using a new level-set approach, and for which computational costs are remarkably low. Toward practical implementation of these results for path planning in unstructured environments, we develop a receding-horizon formulation in which path planning for moving and static obstacles is addressed locally, while path planning for static obstacles is addressed globally. This formulation reduces the overall computational burden of path planning and makes it suitable for very large domains. The result is a suboptimal receding horizon planner and a matching condition that connects local planning with global planning. We present a rigorous analysis from which convergence to a desired endpoint is guaranteed.",23

The key research question addressed in this paper is how to learn planners that generate human-like motion behavior. Our approach uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn human-like navigation behavior based on example paths. Since robots have only limited sensing, we extend existing IRL methods to the case of partially observable environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic crowd flow simulator in which we modeled multiple scenarios in crowded environments. We show that our planner learned to guide the robot along the flow of people when the environment is crowded, and along the shortest path if no people are around.",269

In order to account for the practical requirements of the holistic autonomous system, we propose a semi-reactive trajectory generation method, which can be tightly integrated into the behavioral layer. The method realizes long-term objectives such as velocity keeping, merging, following, stopping, in combination with a reactive collision avoidance by means of optimal-control strategies within the Frenét-Frame of the street. The capabilities of this approach are demonstrated in the simulation of a typical high-speed highway scenario.",483
icra,None,A dynamic subgoal path planner for unpredictable environments,"Hong Liu,Weiwei Wan,Hongbin Zha,","Although lots of planning algorithms have focused on the planning of fixed manipulators and mobile robots in moderate dynamic environments, seldom planning algorithms can be employed to deal with mobile agents in the presence of large scenario scales and unpredictable changing obstacles. Path planning for mobile robots in unpredictable environments would be an extreme challenge since computational complexity increase dramatically with high dimensionality, unpredictability and large scales. In this paper, a novel and real-time approach is proposed to solve this problem by generating subgoals dynamically according to time and potential values. This dynamic subgoal based approach includes two procedures, the subgoal generator and the inter-subgoal or inner replanner. On the one hand, a set of high-level subgoals is generated dynamically by an improved single shot strategy that could tailor itself adaptively. On the other hand, a roadmap is built during the preprocessing phase by employing a localized Dynamic Roadmap Mapping (local-DRM) for inter-subgoal replanning. Finally these two procedures will collaborate according to the potential field criterion to ensure completeness. Our approach can not only generate paths rapidly enough to satisfy the requirements of an anytime planer but also work for large scenario scales. Experimental results on different kinds of mobile agents, in large scenario scales and in the presence of unpredictable changing obstacles show that our approach can find out a collision free path on an average of 0.11s for a single planning, indicating an anytime planner.",21

The algorithm recognises incorrect loop closures, not supported by the odometry, and uses this information to update the feature weights in the tree to suppress further associations from these features. Two methods of adjusting these feature entropies are proposed, one decreasing entropy related to incorrect features in a uniform manner and the other proportional to the contribution of the said feature. Preliminary results showing the performance of the proposed method are presented where it is found that by adjusting the feature entropies, the number of incorrect associations can be reduced while improving the quality of the correct matches.",21

To overcome the matching ambiguity of single line segments, intersecting line pairs in 2D images are utilized for line matching. Coplanarity of the intersecting line pairs and their corresponding intersection context discriminate true intersecting line pairs from false intersecting ones in 3D world.

icra,None,Feature detection and matching in images with radial distortion,"Miguel Lourenço,João P. Barreto,Abed Malti,","Image keypoints are broadly used in robotics for different purposes, ranging from recognition to 3D reconstruction, passing by SLAM and visual servoing. Robust keypoint matching across different views is problematic because of the relative motion between camera and scene that causes significant changes in feature appearance. The problem can be partially overcome by using state-of-the-art methods for keypoint detection and matching, that are resilient to common affine transformations such as changes in scale and rotation. Unfortunately, these approaches are not invariant to the radial distortion present in images acquired by cameras with wide field-of-view. This article proposes modifications to the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), that improve the repeatability of detection and effectiveness of matching in the presence of distortion, while preserving the characteristics of invariance to scale and rotation. These modifications require an approximate modeling of the image distortion, and consist in using adaptative gaussian filtering for detection and implicit gradient correction for description. Extensive experiments, with both synthetic and real images, show that our method outperforms explicit distortion correction using image rectification.",29
icra,None,Minimum-error active matching for real-time vision,"Zhibin Liu,Zongying Shi,Wenli Xu,","As an integral part of real-time vision system, there are two most important requirements for feature matching mechanisms: high computational efficiency for meeting the real-time demands, and high correct matching rate for ensuring the convergence and consistency of state estimation. Both of these are addressed and solved as an integrated whole by the efficient minimum-error active matching scheme proposed in this paper. Image processing is performed in a dynamically guided fashion by checking only parts of the image where positive matches are most probable. For achieving the global consensus matchings, rigorous analysis on how to minimize the matching errors in active matching by choosing an optimal search order is made. After that, practical feature matching algorithms are given, which have naturally absorbed the ideas of nearest neighbor (NN) and joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB) approaches. Both statistical simulations and real-world experimental results have verified the proposed methods can perform better than the state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e. being able to obtain the best global consensus matchings with much lower computational cost.",0

While free space beam mechanics-based models of the shape of these `active cannulas' exist, current models cannot account for external forces and torques applied to the cannula by the environment. In this paper we apply geometrically exact beam theory to solve the statics problem for concentric-tube continuum robots. This yields the equivalent of forward kinematics for an active cannula with general tube precurvature functions and arbitrarily many tubes, under loading from a general wrench distribution. The model achieves average experimental tip errors of less than 3 mm over the workspace of a prototype active cannula subject to various tip forces.",45

This design provides a compact deployable mechanical architecture that may be inserted through a single Ø15 mm access port. Dexterous surgical intervention and stereo vision are achieved via the use of two snake-like continuum robots and two controllable CCD cameras. Simulations and dexterity evaluation of our proposed design are compared to several design alternatives with different kinematic arrangements. Results of these simulations show that dexterity is improved by using an independent revolute joint at the tip of a continuum robot instead of achieving distal rotation by transmission of rotation about the backbone of the continuum robot. Further, it is shown that designs with two robotic continuum robots as surgical arms have diminished dexterity if the bases of these arms are close to each other. This result justifies our design and points to ways of improving the performance of existing designs that use continuum robots as surgical arms.",153

However, catheter technologies are currently unable to track fast tissue motion, which is required to perform delicate procedures inside a beating heart. This paper proposes an actuated catheter tool that compensates for the motion of heart structures like the mitral valve apparatus by servoing a catheter guidewire inside a flexible sheath. We examine design and operation parameters that affect performance and establish that friction and backlash limit the tracking performance of the catheter system. Based on the results of these experiments and a model of the backlash behavior, we propose and implement compensation methods to improve trajectory tracking performance. The catheter system is evaluated with 3D ultrasound guidance in simulate in vivo conditions. The results demonstrate that with mechanical and control system design improvements, a robotic catheter system can accurately track the fast motion of the human mitral valve.",57

icra,None,Control of cable actuated devices using smooth backlash inverse,"Varun Agrawal,William J. Peine,Bin Yao,SeungWook Choi,","Cable conduit actuation provides a simple yet dexterous mode of power transmission for remote actuation. However, they are not preferred because of the nonlinearities arising from friction and cable compliance which lead to backlash type of behavior. Unlike most of the current research in backlash control which generally assumes no knowledge of one of the intermediate states, the controller design in this case can be significantly simplified if output feedback of the system is available. This paper uses a simple feedforward control law for backlash compensation. A novel smooth backlash inverse is proposed, which takes the physical limitations of the actuator in consideration, unlike other designs, and thus makes it more intuitive to use. Implementation of this inverse on physical systems can also improve the system performance over the theoretical exact inverse, as well as other existing smooth inverse designs. Improvement in the performance is shown through experiments on a robot arm of Laprotek surgical system as well as on an experimental setup using polymeric cables for actuation.",94

The system consists of an optical tracking system, a lightweight robot and a scan head. While a standard point to point transformation for the transformation between optical tracking system and robot is inadequate, a special registration algorithm was developed and therefore is used. This allows an automatic registration by moving the robot to different positions and storing the position of a body attached to the robot TCP. The scan head is registered to the optical tracking system or to the robot using a camera that tracks the prototype laser. Only the patient must be registered manually. The result is that the robot moves to the target position on the bone defined inside the segmented 3D CT dataset. With the known registration between robot and tracking system the robot can also be controlled via visual servoing.",10

This program started in 2005 and finished in 2009. The goal of the Learning Locomotion program was to develop control algorithms for autonomous traversal of large, irregular obstacles by an unmanned quadrupedal robot. The program was designed to allow multiple teams to compete for the fastest speeds across the terrain boards using identical hardware. Terrain sensing and localization issues were eliminated by providing a high resolution height map of the terrain as well as real time pose information of the robot on the terrain. The objective for each trial was to reach the goal position as fast as possible.",1

We report on field experiments in California's Amboy Crater lava field and demonstrate fundamental capabilities for adaptive exploration in geologic mapping tasks. We show feature detection and instrument visual servoing that enables automated science observation of dozens of targets. Gaussian process models are used to discover spatial and cross-sensor structure including correlations between different locations and sensing scales. The rover develops these relationships on the fly with only on-board computation, reinterpreting remote sensing data in light of the surface materials it observes.

icra,None,MagMites - Microrobots for wireless microhandling in dry and wet environments,"D. R. Frutiger,B. E. Kratochvil,Bradley J. Nelson,","Central to the challenge of building sub-mm robots, or microrobots, is the development of effective power storage and locomotion mechanisms. In 2007 we introduced the Wireless Resonant Magnetic Micro-actuator (WRMMA) and its application in a successful microrobotic platform, the MagMite. The term MagMite is derived from Magnetic Mite-a tribute to the underlying magnetic propulsion principle and the microscale dimensions of the robot. The device harvests magnetic energy from the environment and effectively transforms it into impact-driven mechanical force while being fully controllable. It can be powered and controlled with oscillating fields in the kHz range and strengths as low as 2 mT, which is only roughly 50 times the average earth magnetic field. These microrobotic agents with dimensions less than 300 μm × 300 μm × 70 μm are capable of moving forward, backward and turning in place while reaching speeds in excess of 12.5 mm/s or 42 times the robot's body length per second. The robots produce enough force to push micro-objects of similar sizes and can be visually servoed through a maze in a fully automated fashion. The devices exhibit an overall degree of flexibility, controllability and performance unmatched by other microrobots reported in the literature. The robustness of the MagMites leads to high experimental repeatability, which in turn enabled them to successfully compete in the RoboCup 2007 and 2009 Nanogram competitions. In this video contribution we offer an integrated explanation of the non-intuitive MagMite actuation principle. This is achieved with the help of computer animation in direct comparison with real experimental footage. Furthermore, new recordings of the microrobots operating under dry and wet conditions while performing automated microhandling tasks are presented.",10

As it approaches a wall, the plane executes an intentional pitch-up maneuver to shed speed and present its feet for landing. On contact, a nonlinear suspension dissipates the remaining kinetic energy and directs interaction forces toward the feet, where microspines can engage small asperities on surfaces such as brick or concrete. The plane can then take off by disengaging the spines and lifting off, pointing its nose up and away from the wall to slowly build forward speed until it can resume normal flight.",44

Wolf,Lars Blackmore,Yoshiaki Kuwata,Nanaz Fathpour,,,","This paper introduces a new algorithm for probabilistic motion planning in arbitrary, uncertain vector fields, with emphasis on high-level planning for Montgolfieré balloons in the atmosphere of Titan. The goal of the algorithm is to determine what altitude—and what horizontal actuation, if any is available on the vehicle—to use to reach a goal location in the fastest expected time. The winds can vary greatly at different altitudes and are strong relative to any feasible horizontal actuation, so the incorporation of the winds is critical for guidance plans. This paper focuses on how to integrate the uncertainty of the wind field into the wind model and how to reach a goal location through the uncertain wind field, using a Markov decision process (MDP). The resulting probabilistic solutions enable more robust guidance plans and more thorough analysis of potential paths than existing methods.",31

The VTAV has one ducted fan fixed to its body and two ducted fans that can be tilted in order to make rotational moments, which makes the system dynamics even more complicated. This paper focuses on giving a precise dynamical model that includes aerodynamic effects of ducted fans. Then it presents a hovering controller based on the dynamical model developed. Since the horizontal dynamics are under actuated, a switching control approach is introduced to realize a stabilizing controller. Numerical simulations prove the validity of the approach.",11

icra,None,Torque and workspace analysis for flexible tendon driven mechanisms,"Maxime Chalon,Thomas Wimböck,Gerd Hirzinger,","Tendon driven mechanisms have been considered in robotic design for several decades. They provide lightweight end effectors with high dynamics. Using remote actuators it is possible to free more space for mechanics or electronics. Nevertheless, lightweight mechanism are fragile and unfortunately their control software can not protect them during the very first instant of an impact. Compliant mechanisms address this issue, providing a mechanical low pass filter, increasing the time available before the controller reacts. Using adjustable stiffness elements and an antagonistic architecture, the joint stiffness can be adjusted by variation of the tendon pre-tension. In this paper, the fundamental equations of m antagonistic tendon driven mechanisms are reviewed. Due to limited tendon forces the maximum torque and the maximum acheivable stiffness are dependent. This implies, that not only the torque workspace, or the stiffness workspace must be considered but also their interactions. Since the results are of high dimensionality, quality measures are necessary to provide a synthetic view. Two quality measures, similar to those used in grasp planning, are presented. They both provide the designer with a more precise insight into the mechanism.",16

With the goal of avoiding such configurations, the prestress stable WCW (PSWCW) is defined as a subset of the WCW where an increase in the prestress level leads to an increase in the overall stiffness of the mechanism. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the geometry of planar parallel CDMs with four cables with the objective of reaching a desired PSWCW. Results are obtained that may guide the designer in the preliminary selection of mechanism dimensions and cable connectivities.",17
icra,None,A formal method for avoiding hyperstaticity when connecting an exoskeleton to a human member,"Nathanaël Jarrassé,Guillaume Morel,","The design of a robotic exoskeleton often focuses on replicating the kinematics of the human limb that it is connected to. However, human joint kinematics is so complex that in practice, the kinematics of artificial exoskeletons fails to reproduce it exactly. This discrepancy results in hyperstaticity. Namely, uncontrolled interaction forces appear. In this paper, we investigate the problem of connecting an exoskeleton to a human member while avoiding hyperstaticity; to do so, we propose to add passive mechanisms at each connection point. We thus introduce a formal methodology for avoiding hyperstaticity when connecting wearable robotic structures to the human body. First, analyzing the twist spaces generated by these fixation passive mechanisms, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a given global isostaticity condition to be respected. Then, we derive conditions on the number of Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) to be freed at the different fixations, under full kinematic rank assumption. We finally apply the general methodology to the particular case of a 4 DoF shoulder-elbow exoskeleton. Experimental results allow to show an improvement in transparency brought by the passive mechanism fixations.",25

The feature of low motion noises allows our system to work like a real human head/neck. Thus the level of acoustic noises from wearable equipments, such as donning respirators or chemical-resistant jackets, induced by human head motion can be simulated and investigated using such a system. The objective of this investigation is to facilitate using head-worn communication devices for the person who wears the protective equipment/uniform that usually produces communication-noise when the head/neck moves. Our low motion-noise humanoid neck system is based on the spring structure, which can generate 1 Degree of Freedom (DOF) jaw movement and 3DOF neck movement. To guarantee the low-noise feature, no noise-makers like gear and electro-driven parts are embedded in the head/neck structure. Instead, the motions are driven by seven cables, and the actuators pulling the cables are sealed in a sound insulation box. Furthermore, statics analysis of the system has been processed completely. Experimental results validate the analysis, and clearly show that the head/neck system can greatly mimic the motions of human head with an A-weighted noise level of 30 dB or below.",14

The setup consists of a tank filled with sand and water, plastic models of bivalve shells capable of expelling water and an external actuation mechanism simulating the rocking burrowing motion typically used by these animals. The realistic shell shapes have been realized using three-dimensional plotting techniques allowing testing influences of different shell shapes and surface structures (sculptures) on the burrowing efficiency. Based on the experimental setup, the burrowing process has been reproduced. The results show that this setup can be used to identify correlations in the burrowing process. Further experimental work will investigate the influence of factors such as shell shape and sculpture or the motion sequence on the burrowing performance.",18

Evaluation of computational models and resulting robotic architecture is usually carried out at the behavioral level by evaluating experimental tasks similar to those performed with rats. While multiple metrics are defined to evaluate behavioral performance in rats, metrics for robot task evaluation are very limited mostly to success/failure and time to complete task. In this paper we present a set of metrics taken from rat spatial memory and learning evaluation to further analyze performance in robots. The proposed set of metrics, learning latency and ability to navigate minimal distance to goal, should offer the robotics community additional tools to assess performance and validity of models in biologically-inspired robotic architectures at the task performance level. We also provide a comparative evaluation using these metrics between similar spatial tasks performed by rat and robot in comparable environments.",2

This form of locomotion is particularly effective in constrained spaces, and although the motion has been understood for some time, it has rarely been effectively or accurately implemented in a robotic platform. We address some reasons for this, including some common misconceptions within the field. We present a technique using a braided mesh exterior to produce fluid waves of motion along the body of a worm-like robot. We also present a new analytical model of this motion and compare predicted robot velocity to a 2-D simulation. Unlike previous mathematical models of peristaltic motion, our model suggests that friction is not a limiting factor in robot speed, but only in acceleration. The concept is highly scalable, and we present methods of construction at two different scales.",37

Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure with NiTi coil actuators. A numerical model for the mesh structure describes how peristaltic motion induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and compared on the basis of locomotion speed. The entire mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impacts during locomotion.

Almost all existing novelty detection techniques, however, suffer from diminished performance when the number of less relevant, redundant or noisy features increases, as often the case with high-dimensional feature spaces. Many of these algorithms are also not suited for online use, a trait that is highly desirable for many robotic applications. We present a novelty detection algorithm that is able to address this sensitivity to high feature dimensionality by utilizing prior class information within the training set. Additionally, our anytime algorithm is well suited for online use when a constantly adjusting environmental model is beneficial. We apply this algorithm to online detection of novel perception system input on an outdoor mobile robot and argue such abilities could be key in increasing the real-world applications and impact of mobile robotics 1 .",30

We analyze the tracing dynamics, address under what conditions a given geometric path can be traced (traceability conditions), and prove under what conditions the tracing motion is repetitive.

Furthermore, in contrast to the automatically guided vehicle planning problem in a manufacturing environment, the container carriers described here are free ranging. Although, the port structure imposes a set of “virtual” roadways along which the vehicles are allowed to travel, path planning is essential in preventing contention and collisions.

The operational support in construction machinery filed requires the compatibility with different types of support and the commonality among various operator skill levels. The proposed framework is therefore organized into two functions: real-time task phase identification and time-series attentional condition identification. The task phase is defined by utilizing the joint load applied according to the environment constraint condition. The attentional condition is defined as one of the internal work-state condition classified by the necessity level of operational support, and is dependent on the vectorial or time-series date selected by the identified task phase. Experiments are conducted using the hydraulic dual arm system to perform transporting and removing tasks. Results show that the number of error contacts, internal force applied, and mental workload is decreased without time-consumption increase. The result confirmed that the proposed framework greatly contribute to improving each operator's work performance.",6

In this paper we carefully analyze this new approach and apply dimensionality reduction techniques to decrease the number of features that need to be computed in order to classify whether a given pixel in an image is associated with a good or bad grasping point. Exploiting the ideas behind principal component analysis, we formulate two hypotheses about possible ways to eliminate certain features from training and classification. We then experimentally verify that the feature reduction significantly improves speed while retaining classification accuracy. Overall, the combination of the two hypotheses leads to a speedup factor of almost ten. The hypotheses are validated on third party synthetic data and also demonstrated on a seven degrees-of-freedom manipulator.",14
icra,None,Immobilizing 2D serial chains in form closure grasps,"Elon Rimon,Frank van der Stappen,","The immobilization of non-rigid objects is a relatively unexplored area in grasp mechanics. This paper considers the immobilization of 2D serial chains of n hinged polygons at a given placement using frictionless point fingers. The paper sets the problem in the context of classical grasping theory by showing that chain immobilization can only be achieved with equilibrium grasps. In earlier work we described an immobilization procedure for serial chains of n≠3 polygons using n+2 frictionless point fingers. However, the immobilization of three-link chains remained an open problem. This paper establishes that three-link chains can usually be immobilized with five point fingers, but certain three-link chains can only be immobilized with six point fingers. The paper then considers the robust immobilization of serial chains under small contact placement errors. We describe a procedure for robust immobilization of n-link chains that requires only one extra contact for the entire chain, using a total of n+3 frictionless point fingers. The immobilization procedures and the exceptional three-link chains are illustrated with example.",30

Along these directions, we present an optimization framework for underactuated compliant hands. Our approach uses a pre-defined set of grasps in a quasistatic equilibrium formulation to compute the actuation mechanism design parameters that provide optimal performance. We apply our method to a class of tendon-actuated hands; for the simplified design of a two-fingered gripper, we show how a global optimum for the design optimization problem can be computed.

Surprisingly, this potential has not been extensively exploited up to now. A reason for this is that, since the acquired depth images are noisy, most of the available registration algorithms are hardly applicable. A further difficulty is that the transformations between views are in general not accurately known, a circumstance that multi-view object modeling algorithms do not handle properly under noisy conditions. In this work, we take into account both uncertainty sources (in images and camera poses) to generate spatially consistent 3D object models fusing multiple views with a probabilistic approach. We propose a method to compute the covariance of the registration process, and apply an iterative state estimation method to build object models under noisy conditions.",62

It is shown that a causality analysis is required in the framework to detect if any of the model elements have, a time dependent change of energy function in the energy balance of the system. The Standard Linear Solid model, which is often used to simulate the visco-elastic interaction with soft biological tissue is used as an example.

The proposed architecture is distributed, in that each user simulates and interacts with its own local copy of the shared virtual environment. Spring connection among the local copies and local damping are used, which, together, under a certain condition, achieve configuration synchronization among the local copies while enforcing discrete-time passivity of the total peer-to-peer architecture, thereby, rendering the architecture portable/scalable for any (passive) users/devices and ensuring its interaction stability be user/device-invariant. The issue of optimizing communication network is also addressed with some relevant experimental results.",24
icra,None,Three-dimensional human arm and hand dynamics and variability model for a stylus-based haptic interface,"Michael J. Fu,M. Cenk Æavuşoğlu,","Human-computer/machine interface research benefits from accurate human arm models for stability analysis, control, and system design. The current study developed models for human arm dynamics and variability specific to stylus-based kinesthetic haptic interfaces. Data from nine human subjects (5 male, 4 female, ages 20–30) were collected using a three degree-of-freedom haptic device in the X, Y, and Z axes along with a range of grip forces (1–3N) for parametric system identification of the human arm and hand. Variability models that accounted for subject and grip force variation were also identified. The arm and hand model structure consisted of a third-order linear parametric transfer function that was paired with a previously derived second-order model for the haptic robot. The variability was modeled as multiplicative unstructured uncertainty using transfer functions. All of the model parameters were identified in the frequency domain and have force as input and position as output.",14
icra,None,Control of a high fidelity ungrounded torque feedback device: The iTorqU 2.1,"Kyle N. Winfree,Joseph M. Romano,Jamie Gewirtz,Katherine J. Kuchenbecker,","This paper outlines how a control moment gyroscope can be used to generate haptic torque feedback while minimizing the effects of a constrained gimbal workspace. We present the design of the iTorqU 2.1 and discuss how it compares to previously developed systems. We then detail the control algorithms we have developed for both transparency and torque output modes. The prescribed transparency controller is typical in design, but the torque output algorithm is novel to this type of haptic device. It makes use of a series of position-p-at-time-t commands, which we call packets. Five packet designs were considered in this research, but we have included only the most important three in this paper. While this research deals with torque feedback, it ultimately presents a method for working with devices that are limited by the need for continuous reset to a home position before subsequent outputs.",14

The proposed method is based on a spectral technique, which finds consistent correspondences between two range scans without any initial alignment while considering how well their associated pairwise geometric relationships are satisfied. Based on the scan matching method, we also suggest a strategy for global localization in indoor environments, which is applicable to both grid maps and topological maps having metric information. The feasibility of the proposed methods is demonstrated by experimental results.",14
icra,None,A generalization of the metric-based Iterative Closest Point technique for 3D scan matching,"Leopoldo Armesto,Javier Minguez,Luis Montesano,","Scan matching techniques have been widely used to compute the displacement of robots. This estimate is part of many algorithms addressing navigation and mapping. This paper addresses the scan matching problem in three dimensional workspaces. We propose an generalization of the Metric based Iterative Closest Point (MbICP) to the 3D case. The main contribution is the development of all the mathematical tools required to formulate the ICP with this new metric, including the derivation of point to plane distances based on the new metric. We also provide experimental results to evaluate the algorithms and different combinations of ICP and MbICP to illustrate the advantages of the metric based approach.",51

The basis of the algorithm is the minimization of an error function that takes point correspondences into account. While four closed-form solution methods are known for minimizing this function, linearization seems necessary for solving the global scan registration problem. This paper presents such linear solutions for registering n-scans in a global and simultaneous fashion. It studies parameterizations for the rigid body transformations of the n-scan registration problem.",14
icra,None,Sancta simplicitas - on the efficiency and achievable results of SLAM using ICP-based incremental registration,"Dirk Holz,Sven Behnke,","This paper presents an efficient combination of algorithms for SLAM in dynamic environments. The overall approach is based on range image registration using the ICP algorithm. Different extensions to this algorithm are used to incrementally construct point models of the robot's workspace. A simple heuristic allows for determining which points in a newly acquired range image are already contained in the point model and for adding only those points that provide new information. Furthermore, the means for dealing with environment dynamics are presented which allow for continuously conducting SLAM and updating the point model according to changes in a dynamic environment. The achievable results of the overall approach are compared to Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters as a state-of-the-art solution to the SLAM problem and evaluated using a recently published benchmark by Burgard et al.

icra,None,Extracting general-purpose features from LIDAR data,"Yangming Li,Edwin B. Olson,","The detection of features from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data is a fundamental component of feature-based mapping and SLAM systems. Existing detectors tend to exploit characteristics of specific environments: corners and lines from indoor (rectilinear) environments, and trees from outdoor environments. While these detectors work well in their intended environments, their performance in different environments can be very poor. We describe a general purpose feature detector for LIDAR data that is applicable to virtually any environment. Our methods adapt classic feature detection methods from the image processing literature, specifically the multi-scale Kanade-Tomasi corner detector. Our resulting method is capable of identifying stable features at a variety of spatial scales and produces uncertainty estimates for use in a state estimation algorithm. We present results on standard datasets, including Victoria Park and Intel Research Center (both 2D), and the MIT DARPA Urban Challenge dataset (3D).",122

Whereas this problem has been studied intensively in the context of robot vision, relatively few approaches are available for three-dimensional range data. In this paper, we present a novel and robust method for place recognition based on range images. Our algorithm matches a given 3D scan against a database using point features and scores potential transformations by comparing significant points in the scans. A further advantage of our approach is that the features allow for a computation of the relative transformations between scans which is relevant for registration processes. Our approach has been implemented and tested on different 3D data sets obtained outdoors. In several experiments we demonstrate the advantages of our approach also in comparison to existing techniques.",145
icra,None,Indoor scene recognition through object detection,"P. Espinace,T. Kollar,A. Soto,N. Roy,","Scene recognition is a highly valuable perceptual ability for an indoor mobile robot, however, current approaches for scene recognition present a significant drop in performance for the case of indoor scenes. We believe that this can be explained by the high appearance variability of indoor environments. This stresses the need to include high-level semantic information in the recognition process. In this work we propose a new approach for indoor scene recognition based on a generative probabilistic hierarchical model that uses common objects as an intermediate semantic representation. Under this model, we use object classifiers to associate low-level visual features to objects, and at the same time, we use contextual relations to associate objects to scenes. As a further contribution, we improve the performance of current state-of-the-art category-level object classifiers by including geometrical information obtained from a 3D range sensor that facilitates the implementation of a focus of attention mechanism within a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We test our approach using real data, showing significant advantages with respect to previous state-of-the-art methods.",102
icra,None,Detection and filtering of landmark occlusions using Terrain Spatiograms,"Damian M. Lyons,","A team of robots cooperating to quickly produce a map needs to share landmark information between members so that the local maps can be accurately merged. However, the appearance of landmarks as seen by members of the team can change dramatically due to the phenomenon of occlusion. We have previously presented an approach to landmark representation using Terrain Spatiograms an extension to image spatiograms in which the spatial information relates to the scene rather than the image. Because this representation preserves depth structure, it is possible to identify and filter potential occlusions. We present an approach to identifying and filtering occlusions using terrain spatiograms, and report experimental results on 20 landmark datasets for varying states of occlusion. We show that occlusion can be detected and filtered, resulting in improved landmark matching scores.",2
icra,None,Geo-referencing for UAV navigation using environmental classification,"Fredrik Lindsten,Jonas Callmer,Henrik Ohlsson,David Törnqvist,,,","A UAV navigation system relying on GPS is vulnerable to signal failure, making a drift free backup system necessary. We introduce a vision based geo-referencing system that uses pre-existing maps to reduce the long term drift. The system classifies an image according to its environmental content and thereafter matches it to an environmentally classified map over the operational area. This map matching provides a measurement of the absolute location of the UAV, that can easily be incorporated into a sensor fusion framework. Experiments show that the geo-referencing system reduces the long term drift in UAV navigation, enhancing the ability of the UAV to navigate accurately over large areas without the use of GPS.",48
icra,None,A saliency-based approach to boost trail detection,"Pedro Santana,Nelson Alves,Luís Correia,José Barata,","This paper presents a saliency-based solution to boost trail detection. The proposed model builds on the empirical observation that trails are usually conspicuous structures in natural environments. This hypothesis is confirmed by the experimental results, where a strong positive correlation between trail location and visual saliency has been observed. These results are due in part to the proposed extensions to a well known visual saliency computational model. This paper goes further and shows that, with a proper analysis of the saliency information alone, the ambiguity regarding both trail's position and approximate skeleton is reduced to three hypotheses in 98% of the tested natural images. This analysis is performed by a set of agents inhabiting the saliency and feature specific intermediate maps. These agents' behaviours exploit implicit, top-down knowledge about the object being sought in an active way. With the proposed model, computationally demanding accurate trail detectors are able to focus their activity in a fraction of the input image, thus promoting robustness and real-time performance.",9
icra,None,Comparing and modeling distributed control strategies for miniature self-assembling robots,"William C. Evans,Grégory Mermoud,Alcherio Martinoli,","We propose two contrasting approaches to the scalable distributed control of a swarm of self-assembling miniaturized robots, specifically the formation of chains of a desired length: (1) a deterministic controller in which robots communicate with each other in order to directly limit the size of each chain, and (2) a probabilistic controller where the average chain size is controlled by the probability a robot will choose to leave its chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of both approaches by implementing them on a real swarm of Alice robots. Using Webots, a realistic simulator for mobile robotics, and macroscopic models based on the Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) framework, we investigate the limitations of the deterministic controller and demonstrate the existence of optimal parameters for the probabilistic controller where exploration and exploitation are well balanced, thus favoring the formation of larger chains.",32
icra,None,Multirobot coordination by auctioning POMDPs,"Matthijs T.J. Spaan,Nelson Gonçalves,João Sequeira,","We consider the problem of task assignment and execution in multirobot systems, by proposing a procedure for bid estimation in auction protocols. Auctions are of interest to multirobot systems because they provide a flexible way to coordinate the assignment of tasks to robots. The main idea is to exploit task execution controllers that rely on the availability of value functions. These provide a natural way to obtain the bid values for a given task, compared to the heuristic and ad-hoc bid estimation procedures in common use. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework is used to compute policies for the execution of tasks by each agent, with the task bid values obtained directly from the respective value functions. Several simulation examples are presented for an urban surveillance environment, illustrating the applicability of our ideas.",20
icra,None,A general information quality based approach for satisfying sensor constraints in multirobot tasks,"Yu Zhang,Lynne E. Parker,","Many architectures have been proposed to solve tightly-coupled multirobot tasks (MT) through coalitions of heterogeneous robots. However, several issues remain unaddressed. As coalitions are formed, sensor constraints among robots are also established. For example, in a leader-follower task, follower robots must keep leader robots within their sights, while in a box-pushing task, a supervisor robot needs to track the moving direction of the box and monitor the pushing path to the goal for obstacle avoidance. The question of how to keep these constraints satisfied during the entire execution, from initial configurations to completeness of the task, remains an open issue. In addition, environmental factors, both static and dynamic, can influence the maintenance of the constraints. Moreover, problems arise when the constraints are unsatisfiable given the current circumstances. For example, the sight of the leader might be blocked or there might be obstacles blocking the view of the box. This paper proposes a general method to address these issues for various applications with sensors having certain characteristics. Our approach combines the use of sensor models, environment sampling, measures of information quality, a motion model with sampling, and a constraint model. We believe that this approach offers the first generic formulation of robotic sensor constraints that can be applied to a wide variety of applications. To illustrate this method, we apply the approach to solve robot tracking and navigation tasks both in simulation and with physical robots. Experimental results illustrate the flexibility and robustness of the approach.",9
icra,None,Dynamic vehicle routing with stochastic time constraints,"Marco Pavone,Emilio Frazzoli,","In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem where demands have stochastic deadlines on their waiting times. Specifically, a network of robotic vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, location and on-site service are stochastic; moreover, once a demand arrives, it remains active for a stochastic amount of time, and then expires. An active demand is successfully serviced when one of the vehicles visits its location before its deadline and provide the required on-site service. The aim is to find the minimum number of vehicles needed to ensure that the steady-state probability that a demand is successfully serviced is larger than a desired value, and to determine the policy the vehicles should execute to ensure that such objective is attained. First, we carefully formulate the problem, and we show its well-posedness by providing some novel ergodic results. Second, we provide a lower bound on the optimal number of vehicles; finally, we analyze two service policies, and we show that one of them is optimal in light load. Simulation results are presented and discussed.",15
icra,None,Cooperative control synthesis for moving-target-enclosing with changing topologies,"Jing Guo,Gangfeng Yan,Zhiyun Lin,","A moving-target-enclosing problem is investigated in the paper, where the velocity of the target is unknown and the neighbor topologies may change over time. Each robot only uses the relative position information of the target and its neighbors that may dynamically change over time. An adaptive scheme is proposed to estimate the velocity of the target. Then a distributed control law for each robot is presented, which consists of two parts: One amounts to ensuring the convergence of the distance between the robots and the target to the desired one and the other is used to achieve the uniform distribution when enclosing the target in motion. Lyapunov-based techniques and graph theory are brought together for rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties. Our control strategy is practically implementable with only onboard sensors. Simulations are provided to illustrate our results.",32
icra,None,A door opening method by modular re-configurable robot with joints working on passive and active modes,"Saleh Ahmad,Guangjun Liu,","In this paper, we study the problem of door-opening by using a modular re-configurable robot (MRR) mounted on a tracked mobile platform. The main concern of opening a door is how to prevent the internal forces that occur because of the positioning error or the imprecise modeling of the environment, i.e., the door parameters. Most previous research is based on compliant control, which makes the control system rather complicated. In addition, such approaches need expensive force/torque sensor to be implemented. With respect to the multiple working modes of the MRR modules, the complication has been avoided by switching the joints that has axis of rotation parallel to the door hinge to work in passive mode. As a result of this approach, the internal forces between the door and the mobile manipulator will vanish. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed door opening strategy.",17
icra,None,Understanding and executing instructions for everyday manipulation tasks from the World Wide Web,"Moritz Tenorth,Daniel Nyga,Michael Beetz,","Service robots will have to accomplish more and more complex, open-ended tasks and regularly acquire new skills. In this work, we propose a new approach to the problem of generating plans for such household robots. Instead composing them from atomic actions - the common approach in robot planning - we propose to transform task descriptions on web sites like ehow.com into executable robot plans. We present methods for automatically converting the instructions from natural language into a formal, logic-based representation, for resolving the word senses using the WordNet database and the Cyc ontology, and for exporting the generated plans into the mobile robot's plan language RPL. We discuss the problem of inferring information that is missing in these descriptions and the problem of grounding the abstract task descriptions in the perception and action system, and we propose techniques for solving them. The whole system works autonomously without human interaction. It has successfully been tested with a set of about 150 natural language directives, of which up to 80% could be correctly transformed.",149
icra,None,Probabilistic collision state checker for crowded environments,"Daniel Althoff,Matthias Althoff,Dirk Wollherr,Martin Buss,","For path planning algorithms of robots it is important that the robot does not reach a state of inevitable collision. In crowded environments with many humans or robots, the set of possible inevitable collision states (ICS) is often unacceptably high, such that the robot has to stop and wait in too many situations. For this reason, the concept of ICS is extended to probabilistic collision states (PCS), which estimates the collision probability for a given state. This allows to efficiently run planning algorithms through crowded environments when accepting a certain collision probability. A further novelty is that the obstacles possibly react to the robot in order to mitigate the risk of a collision. The results show a significant difference in interaction behavior. Thus, this approach is especially suited for active and non-deterministic moving obstacles in the robot workspace.",55
icra,None,Priming transformational planning with observations of human activities,"Moritz Tenorth,Michael Beetz,","People perform daily activities in many different ways. When setting a table, they might use a tray, stack plates, stack cups on plates, leave the doors of a cupboard open when taking several items out of it. Similarly flexible behavior is desired when mobile robots perform household tasks. Moreover, they should perform actions in a way that they are accepted by the people, for example by showing human-like behavior. In this paper we propose to extend a transformational planning system with models characterizing the behavior produced by the different plans in the plan library. These models are used by the robot to select a plan that resembles human behavior. In addition to acting more human-like, this helps the robot choose good plans for a task by imitating humans instead of performing exhaustive search. We show the feasibility of this approach using a household robot application as an example and present empirical results on the classification accuracy in this domain.",10
icra,None,HTN robot planning in partially observable dynamic environments,"Martin Weser,Dominik Off,Jianwei Zhang,","Experiments showed that Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planners are suitable to find solutions for nontrivial tasks in complex scenarios. Mobile service robots are able to execute actions which may constitute the basic building blocks to achieve high-level goals. However, only few experiments demonstrate the application of a general purpose deliberative planner in the domain of mobile service robots. One challenging problem arises from the fact that adaptive AI-based planners presume the closed-world assumption (CWA) and are therefore unable to deal with incomplete information. Unknown objects which are not represented in the planning domain, for example, cannot be integrated into the planning process. Since mobile service robots act in a real dynamic environment and construct or adapt their world model autonomously based on sensory data, they are inevitably confronted with uncertain and incomplete information about the world. This conflict between simplified assumptions for planning on the one hand and the complexity of the real world on the other constitutes a major problem of modern robotics. This paper describes two approaches to dealing with incomplete world knowledge in the context of HTN robot planning. Several experiments demonstrate that the approaches can successfully be applied in a dynamic and unstructured environment.",34

Then how to optimize the camera parameters based on image entropy is proposed to make robot vision adaptive to the different light conditions. The algorithm is tested by using the omnidirectional vision in indoor RoboCup Middle Size League environment and the perspective camera in outdoor ordinary environment, and the results show that the method is effective and color constancy to some extent can be achieved.",40
icra,None,A new sensor self-calibration framework from velocity measurements,"Olivier Kermorgant,David Folio,François Chaumette,","In this paper we propose a new on-line sensor self-calibration framework. The approach is to consider the sensor/robot interaction that links the sensor signal variations to the robot velocity. By on-line calibration, we mean only the actual measurements are used to perform calibration under the condition that the interaction matrix is analytically known. This allows us to propose a very simple and versatile formulation of sensor parameter calibration. Various sensors can be considered, and calibration from different sensory data may be considered within the same process. Intrinsic and extrinsic parameters estimation are formulated as a non-linear minimization problem the Jacobian of which can be expressed analytically from the sensor model. Simulations and experiments are presented for a camera observing four points, showing good results in the case of separated intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, and illustrating the possible limitations in the case of simultaneous estimation.",1

We propose a simplification for non-uniform filtering by stacking of box filters from a single integral image.

Owing to the simultaneous high-frame-rate video processing and recording, IDP Express can be used as an intelligent video logger for long-term high-speed phenomenon analysis even when the measured objects move quickly in a wide area. We applied IDP Express to a mechanical target tracking system to record a high-frame-rate video at high resolution for a crucial moment, which is magnified by tracking the measured objects with visual feedback control.

This paper proposes a method for estimating an image when AC illumination components are eliminated. If the eliminated illumination component is the source of specular reflection, the image produced only contains the diffuse reflection components of other illuminations. Removal of the specular reflection enhances the adaptability of a robot vision system to real environments. Experimental results show the advantage of the proposed method over using previous methods.

We have designed two mechanical failsafe units and a software force limiter; this along with velocity control can guarantee a safe operation in reduction force.

icra,None,Kinematic path-following control of a mobile robot on arbitrary surface,"Gavin Kane,Robert Boesecke,Jörg Raczkowsky,Heinz Wörn,","This paper outlines a method for applying a kinematic path following control of a mobile robot without any regard for surface structure. Background. A great deal of mobile robotics kinematics analysis is based on the movement of the robot on a two dimensional flat surface. Our application for precision surgery required a new approach to a system that would operate on a highly non-linear surface; this specific system was a surgical robot that would conduct craniotomies while moving over highly irregular and often deformed skulls. Methods. The approach used an abstract view of the operating environment that would totally ignore the surface, instead determining the control parameters based only on the robot and the desired cutting trajectory. The approach was then evaluated in a 3D environment using a series of predefined surfaces to determine bounding limits in the control theory. These limits were then tested in a second series of tests using real data from the CT preoperative imagery of previous patients and phantoms. The simulation results were then compared with the actual performance of the robot on phantoms and cadavers. Results. The approach has been successfully implemented on the first medical robot to position itself through spiked wheels on the surface of the skull. Testing has to date been successful in both a simulation environment, and on initial phantom and cadiever trials, with accuracies equal to that of the larger industrial modified surgical robots.",5

Cunha,","This paper addresses the problem of robust takeoff and landing control of a quadrotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). During the critical flight phases of takeoff and landing the vehicle dynamics change according to the possible existence of contact with the ground. To model the vehicle during the overall maneuver a hybrid automaton is used where each state corresponds to a different dynamic behavior exhibited by the UAV. The original takeoff and landing problems are then addressed as a problem of tracking suitable reference signals in order to achieve the desired transitions between different hybrid states of the automaton. Both reference trajectories and feedback control laws are derived to explicitly account for measurement noise and uncertainties, in both the environment and in the vehicle dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",33
icra,None,Design and experimental verification of a Constrained Finite Time Optimal control scheme for the attitude control of a Quadrotor Helicopter subject to wind gusts,"Kostas Alexis,George Nikolakopoulos,Anthony Tzes,","In this paper the design and the experimental verification of a Constrained Finite Time Optimal (CFTO) control scheme for the attitude control of an Unmanned Quadrotor Helicopter (UqH) subject to wind gusts is being presented. In the proposed design the UqH has been modeled by a set of Piecewise Affine (PWA) linear equations while the wind gusts effects are embedded in the system model description as the affine terms. In this approach the switching among the PWA model descriptions are ruled by the rate of the rotation angles. In the design of the stabilizing CFTO-controller both the magnitude of external disturbances (worst case applied wind gust), and the mechanical constraints of the UqH such as maximum thrust in the rotors and UqH's angles rate are taken under consideration in order to design an off-line controller that could rapidly be applied to a UqH in a form of a look-up table. The proposed control scheme is applied in experimental studies and multiple test-cases are presented that prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",49
icra,None,A simple learning strategy for high-speed quadrocopter multi-flips,"Sergei Lupashin,Angela Schöllig,Michael Sherback,Raffaello D'Andrea,","We describe a simple and intuitive policy gradient method for improving parametrized quadrocopter multi-flips by combining iterative experiments with information from a first-principles model. We start by formulating an N-flip maneuver as a five-step primitive with five adjustable parameters. Optimization using a low-order first-principles 2D vertical plane model of the quadrocopter yields an initial set of parameters and a corrective matrix. The maneuver is then repeatedly performed with the vehicle. At each iteration the state error at the end of the primitive is used to update the maneuver parameters via a gradient adjustment. The method is demonstrated at the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena testbed on quadrotor helicopters performing and improving on flips, double flips and triple flips.",424
icra,None,Design of guaranteed safe maneuvers using reachable sets: Autonomous quadrotor aerobatics in theory and practice,"Jeremy H. Gillula,Haomiao Huang,Michael P. Vitus,Claire J. Tomlin,","For many applications, the control of a complex nonlinear system can be made easier by modeling the system as a collection of simplified hybrid modes, each representing a particular operating regime. An example of this is the decomposition of complex aerobatic flights into sequences of discrete maneuvers, an approach that has proven very successful for both human piloted and autonomously controlled aircraft. However, a critical step when designing such control systems is to ensure the safety and feasibility of transitions between these maneuvers. This work presents a hybrid dynamics framework for the design of guaranteed safe switching regions and is applied to a quadrotor helicopter performing an autonomous backflip. The regions are constructed using reachable sets calculated via a Hamilton-Jacobi differential game formulation, and experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor platform.",168
icra,None,Phased-array piezoelectric actuators using a buckling mechanism having large displacement amplification and nonlinear stiffness,"Devin Neal,Harry Asada,","Novel designs of an array of piezoelectric stack actuators using a unique buckling mechanism are presented in this paper. Multiple PZT actuator units with high gain displacement amplification mechanisms are arranged in parallel with spatial phase differences. Having an inherent kinematic singularity, the buckling mechanism provides not only an extremely high gain of displacement amplification, but also varying stiffness and nonlinear force-displacement characteristics. The phased array PZT actuator exploits this nonlinearity for gaining a large output displacement as well as for combining multiple PZT stacks in parallel without conflicting with each other. Three specific designs of arrayed buckling actuators are presented. The aggregate output force-displacement relationship is analyzed and its profile is shaped with respect to spatial phase differences and nonlinear stiffness and force characteristics of individual PZT buckling actuator units.",8

The realization of this unit aims to facilitate the control of compliant robotic joints by providing physical variable damping on demand assisting on the regulation of the oscillations induced by the introduction of compliance. The mechatronics details and the dynamic model of the damper are introduced. The proposed variable damper mechanism is evaluated on a simple 1-DOF compliant joint linked to the ground through a torsion spring. This flexible connection emulates a compliant joint, generating oscillations when the link is perturbed. Preliminary results are presented to show that the unit and the proposed control scheme are capable of replicating simulated relative damping values with good fidelity.",76

The robot arm is actuated antagonistically by two actuators made up of 60 small SMA springs arranged in parallel, which are activated in an on/off fashion using Joule heating. The force and stiffness of each actuator is controlled by recruiting a desired number of springs to contract. The joint position is then controlled using equilibrium point servo control. The results presented in this paper show that the combination of equilibrium point control of the arm joint and recruitment-based control of each actuator's stiffness solve some of the major problems of scalability and response speed often associated with active material actuators.",11

Culpepper,","We explain when, and why, solder-based phase change materials (PCMs) are best-suited as a means to modify a robotic mechanism's kinematic and elastomechanic behavior. The preceding refers to mechanisms that possess joints which may be thermally locked and unlocked via a material phase change within the joint. Different combinations of locked and unlocked joints can yield several one-DOF mechanisms states. One actuator may be used to control motion allowed by a first state, then a new combination of locked/unlocked joints may be set and the actuator then controls motion allowed by the new state. Compared to other thermo-rheological fluids, solders yield joints with the (i) highest strength and stiffness, (ii) fastest lock/unlock speed, and (iii) lowest lock/unlock power. Herein, we cover physics-based design insights that provide understanding of how solder-based material properties and joint design dominate/limit joint performance characteristics. First order models are used to demonstrate selection of suitable PCMs and how to set initial joint geometry prior to fine tuning via detailed models/experiments. The insights and models are discussed in the context of a joint for a crawling robot that uses a single spooler motor and three solder-locking joints to crawl and steer.",32

The purpose of this study is to develop an easy test-bed for investigating the roles of double-support phase and swing-leg retraction in limit cycle walking. The crossed frame as a swing leg does not have inherent rotational dynamics, and it rotates only in the presence of viscous friction at the central axis. We first analyze the properties of this walker through mathematical modeling. Next, we numerically investigate the gait efficiency, and discuss the effect of inertia moment and mass distribution of the crossed frame. Finally, we briefly report our experimental results.",8
icra,None,Biped blind walking on changing slope with reflex control system,"Feng Tan,Chenglong Fu,Ken Chen,","This paper presents a novel reflex control system for passive biped walking on unknown slope varying terrains by extension of previous work in the fields of CPG. The algorithm takes advantage of the passive dynamics of walking, assisting only when necessary with an intermittent oscillator driving the hip joint. We analyze inherent reasons of falling for a biped system based on dynamic principles and assume that human walking relies more on instinct actions within the spinal cord rather than brain. Corresponding falling tendency function is proposed, based on which a reflex controller adjusting output of oscillator is designed. An auxiliary span angle controller is put forward to provide secondary actuations for compensation to improve landing performance. The proposed reflex system requires no prior knowledge of the terrain or tens of hundreds of experiments, which are necessary for machine learning methods. Results of simulations indicate that our reflex controllers are capable of ensuring stable passive blind walking on slope varying terrains without ankle torque.",15

Freidovich,Uwe Mettin,","We consider a 3-link planar walker with two legs and an upper body. An actuator is introduced between the legs, and the torso is kept upright by torsional springs. The model is a 3-DOF impulsive mechanical system, and the aim is to induce stable limit-cycle walking in level ground. To solve the problem, the ideas of the virtual holonomic constraints approach are explored, used and extended. The contribution is a novel systematic motion planning procedure for solving the problem of gait synthesis, which is challenging for non-feedback linearizable mechanical systems with two or more passive degrees of freedom. For a preplanned gait we compute an impulsive linear system that approximates dynamics transversal to the periodic solution. This linear system is used for the design of a stabilizing feedback controller. Results of numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the performance of the closed loop system.",2
icra,None,Bifurcations and chaos in passive walking of a compass-gait biped with asymmetries,"Jae-Sung Moon,Mark W. Spong,","In this paper we study the problem of passive walking for a compass-gait biped with gait asymmetry. In particular, we identify and classify bifurcations leading to chaos caused by gait asymmetries due to unequal leg masses. We present bifurcation diagrams showing step period versus the ratio of leg masses at various walking slopes. The cell mapping method is used to find stable limit cycles as the parameters are varied. It is found that a variety of bifurcation diagrams can be grouped into six stages that consist of three expanding and three contracting stages. The analysis of each stage shows that passive dynamic walking has multiple attractors depending on initial conditions, and marginally stable limit cycles exhibit not only period doubling, but also period remerging, disconnecting, and disappearing. We also show that the rate of convergence of period doubling sequences is in good agreement with the Feigenbaum constant.",26
icra,None,Joint proprioception acquisition strategy based on joints-muscles topological maps for musculoskeletal humanoids,"Yuto Nakanishi,Kazuo Hongo,Ikuo Mizuuchi,Masayuki Inaba,","Many humanoids have been developed, but more complicated and flexible humanoids must be developed, in order to realize more natural and various motions like humans. However, it is difficult to measure directly joint posture in the multi-dofs joint of such robots (e.g. a hip spherical joint) because of its complicated structure. This paper describes an estimation method for tendon-driven joint postures of these complicated multi-dofs joints, only based on information of muscles' length relative displacement data during joints movement. We regard this posture estimation problem as a pattern matching problem in the mapping space from joint posture to muscle lengths and solve this problem by using very simple searching algorithms. Furthermore, this paper describes a strategy for deciding muscles motor command to acquire its joint proprioception by the proposed joint posture estimation method only based on information of muscles' length relative displacement data. Finally, we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed estimation method by applying this algorithm to the real tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid Kojiro.",19

This paper presents the results of an exploratory study to investigate gesture/speech interfaces for interaction with robots in a situated manner and the development of three iterations of a prototype command set. A command set was compiled from observing users interacting with a simulated interface in a virtual reality environment. We discovered that users find this type of interface intuitive and their commands tend to naturally group into both `High-Level' and `Low-Level' instructions. However, as the robots moved further away, the loss of depth perception and direct feedback was inimical to the interaction. In a second experiment we found that using simple heads up display elements could mitigate these issues.",40
icra,None,An evaluation of local autonomy applied to teleoperated vehicles in underground mines,"Johan Larsson,Mathias Broxvall,Alessandro Saffiotti,","Autonomous vehicles are being increasingly introduced in the mining industry. While these may offer high safety and high productivity, fully autonomous solutions are not always applicable or economically viable. Teleoperation is an attractive option, since it increases safety and comfort of the drivers. Unfortunately, the difficulty to operate the vehicle remotely often results in reduced productivity. In this paper, we show that techniques from the field of mobile robotics can be used to mitigate this problem. We extend a commercial teleoperation system for use in underground mines with a local autonomy functionality, with the main purpose to evaluate if the achieved productivity improvement motivates development of general algorithms and a fully commercial implementation. We then describe a user study performed in an underground mine with a 38 tonne articulated wheel loader, which proves that local autonomy gives a significant improvement in productivity of the teleoperation system, while retaining or even reducing the maintenance costs.",30

We developed a real-time remote transmission system that can deliver multiple tactile properties using a master-slave robot system. First, we assessed what type of tactile properties should be transmitted and how to connect them in real time. Three tactile properties - roughness, friction, and softness - were transmitted on the basis of the real-time estimated physical properties of three main wavelengths, a kinetic friction coefficient, and spring constants, respectively. Tactile stimulations were generated in synchronization with hand exploration at the master side by using local tactile generation models to compensate for communication time delay. The transmission of multiple tactile properties was achieved by the integration and enhancement of our previously reported methods for vibrotactile displays and tactile sensors. A discrimination experiment using different materials showed the feasibility of the total system involving the three tactile properties.",49

Control of the center of buoyancy is accomplished using movable float blocks. The attitude control system is useful to control the pitch angle of UVMSs to enhance their performance and to improve their efficiency of underwater operations. A UVMS that has two 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulators was developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attitude control system. This paper presents a numerical study and some experimental results obtained using the UVMS with the attitude control system. We experimentally confirmed that the proposed system can change the pitch angle of the vehicle between -120 and +105 deg. In another experiment, attitude-maintenance control was conducted. Results show that the proposed system can maintain the vehicle's horizontal attitude during motion of the manipulators.",35
icra,None,Control of robotic manipulators under time-varying sensing-control delays,"Nikhil Chopra,","Time-varying input/output delays in a control system can significantly degrade the stability and performance of the closed loop system. Recently, passivity based control has emerged as a promising candidate to guarantee delay independent stability of passive systems with delays in the input-output channel. In this paper we study set point control of rigid robots with time-varying sensing/control delays. We first show that the classical PD controller can be modified to regulate the robotic manipulator, provided scattering transformation along with additional gains are used in the communication path. While this results in a stable system, asymptotic regulation cannot be guaranteed. Hence, a (delay dependent) gain margin for a proportional position feedback controller is provided to guarantee stability and asymptotic convergence of the regulation error to the origin. To improve closed loop performance, scattering transformation based design of a damping injection scheme is also discussed. The proposed algorithms are numerically verified on a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator.",15
icra,None,Interaction analysis and posture optimization for a reconfigurable tracked mobile modular manipulator negotiating slopes,"Yugang Liu,Guangjun Liu,","This paper analyzes track-terrain and vehicle-manipulator interactions and develops posture optimization algorithms for a reconfigurable tracked mobile modular manipulator negotiating slopes. A tracked mobile robot is associated with unavoidable slippage due to the fact that there are infinite number of contact points between the tracks and the terrain. Furthermore, the reconfiguration of the tracked mobile robot, motion of the onboard manipulator, as well as the centrifugal forces give rise to transfer of load distribution, complicating track-terrain interactions. For a tracked mobile manipulator negotiating slopes, posture optimization is essential for enhancing the traction performance, improving the efficiency of power consumption and avoiding tip-over instabilities. In this paper, track-terrain and vehicle-manipulator interactions are analyzed for a reconfigurable tracked mobile modular manipulator negotiating slopes, and a real-time posture optimization algorithm is developed by online reconfiguring the tracked mobile platform or adjusting motion of the onboard manipulator. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms has been verified by simulations and experiments.",5

For effective ADL task execution, positioning the end-effector with proper wheelchair orientation was optimized as part of the control algorithm. Separate wheelchair and end-effector trajectories were simultaneously followed to execute a “Go To and Open the Door” task. The control methodology, implementation and test results in simulation are presented in this paper.",17
icra,None,Kinematic control of nonholonomic mobile manipulators in the presence of steering wheels,"Alessandro De Luca,Giuseppe Oriolo,Paolo Robuffo Giordano,","We consider the kinematic control problem for nonholonomic mobile manipulators (NMMs) whose base contains steering wheels. For all typical tasks, the steering velocity inputs of such systems do not appear in the differential relationship between the first-order time derivative of the task output and the available NMM inputs. As a consequence, these inputs are not used by velocity-level control laws based on simple (pseudo)inversion of the task Jacobian, leading in general to the impossibility of completing the task. We propose two control solutions to this open problem based on the framework of input-output feedback linearization. First, a static feedback law is presented that defines the unspecified steering velocities via an optimization action in the null space of the task Jacobian. A dynamic feedback law is then proposed based on the input-output differential map obtained by considering the task acceleration. In this case, the velocity of the steering wheels becomes an active input for task execution, together with the manipulator joint accelerations and the driving accelerations of the base. The feasibility and performance of the two kinematic controllers are compared in simulation for a car-like base carrying a planar manipulator.",37
icra,None,Planning for autonomous door opening with a mobile manipulator,"Sachin Chitta,Benjamin Cohen,Maxim Likhachev,","Computing a motion that enables a mobile manipulator to open a door is challenging because it requires tight coordination between the motions of the arm and the base. Hard-coding the motion, on the other hand, is infeasible since doors vary widely in their sizes and types, some doors are opened by pulling and others by pushing, and indoor spaces often contain obstacles that limit the freedom of the mobile manipulator and the degree to which the doors open up. In this paper, we show how to overcome the high-dimensionality of the planning problem by identifying a graph-based representation that is small enough for efficient planning yet rich enough to contain feasible motions that open doors. The use of graph search-based motion planning enables us to handle consistently the wide variance of conditions under which doors need to be open. We demonstrate our approach on the PR2 robot - a mobile manipulator with an omnidirectional base and a 7 degree of freedom arm. The robot was successful in opening a variety of doors both by pulling and pushing.",113
icra,None,Pulling open doors and drawers: Coordinating an omni-directional base and a compliant arm with Equilibrium Point control,"Advait Jain,Charles C. Kemp,","Previously, we have presented an implementation of impedance control inspired by the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis that we refer to as equilibrium point control (EPC). We have demonstrated that EPC can enable a robot in a fixed position to robustly pull open a variety of doors and drawers, and infer their kinematics without detailed prior models. In this paper, we extend this framework to support autonomous motion of the robot's omni-directional base both before and during pulling. With our new methods, we show that the robot can autonomously approach and open doors and drawers for which only the location and orientation of the handle have been provided. We also demonstrate that EPC can coordinate the movement of the robot's omni-directional base and compliant arm while pulling open a door or drawer, which leads to significantly improved performance. Through 40 trials with 10 different doors and drawers, we empirically demonstrated the robustness of the system. The robot succeeded in 37 out of 40 trials, and had no more than a single failure for any particular door or drawer.",82
icra,None,Development of a 2-DOF softness feeling display for tactile tele-presentation of deformable surfaces,"Fuminobu Kimura,Akio Yamamoto,Toshiro Higuchi,","This paper presents a 2-DOF controlled softness display and its application to a tactile tele-presentation system. It has been reported that softness feelings can be displayed by reproducing contact area, or contact width, on a fingertip. Several softness displays based on the contact area control have been reported in past studies, but all of them had only one degree-of-freedom (DOF) for their contact area control. Resultantly, the reproduced contact area was symmetric, which could only produce uniform surface feelings. In some practical deformable surfaces, however, the contact conditions are not uniform over fingertip surfaces; for example, if there is a small lump beneath a soft deformable surface, resultant contact area can become asymmetric. To reproduce such asymmetric contact conditions, a softness display should have more controlled DOFs. This paper reports our trial to realize a multi-DOF controlled softness display. As a first step, this particular paper describes a 2-DOF controlled display. The display has two DC motors which independently control both sides of the contact area. Resultant asymmetric contact area can facilitate, e.g., discrimination of lump location in soft deformable surfaces. The display was integrated into a tactile tele-presentation system together with a contact width sensor, which measures asymmetric contact condition. Using the tele-presentation system, discriminations of lump location are demonstrated.",26

This method dramatically increases the accuracy and repeatability of the readings compared with traditional methods. These improvements will allow the common use of piezoresistive sensors in robotic applications, where only expensive and sophisticated force sensors such as load cells are currently used. We also present a sketch of a haptic interface under development, consisting of a data glove in which these force sensors are integrated. This interface is intended to control an Intelligent Assist Device by measuring operator-applied forces to the load. The new method proposed for measuring forces in piezoresistive sensors consists of reading conductance and capacitance by applying DC and sinusoidal waveforms to the sensors, thereby allow us to determine a multivariable estimation of force, instead of using the traditional, purely resistive model that has been used up to now.",22
icra,None,Shared decision making in a collaborative task with reciprocal haptic feedback - an efficiency-analysis,"Raphaela Groten,Daniela Feth,Angelika Peer,Martin Buss,","When robots leave industrial settings, they have to be designed allowing intuitive communication with the humans they interact with. The current paper focuses on collaboration in kinesthetic tasks. Herein, we investigate decision situations. This way, the need of communication between partners can be addressed. The current paper introduces for the first time an experimental paradigm which allows studying the effect of decision making in haptic collaboration. Because reciprocal haptic feedback is challenging to provide, we analyze its efficiency in human-human collaboration to understand when it is worth to invest in this additional modality. A one degree of tracking experiment with two human partners revealed that the additional physical effort accompanying reciprocal haptic feedback is directly transformed into higher performance (compared to a control condition without reciprocal haptic feedback). Thus, the presented results motivate further research on the nature of the haptic negotiation between human partners to achieve the same performance benefits in kinesthetic collaboration with robotic partners.",27

Object recognition systems typically need a large amount of training data for satisfactory performance. The problem is particularly acute when many object categories are present. In this paper we present a batch-mode active learning framework for multi-class image classification systems. In active learning, images are to be chosen for interactive labeling, instead of passively accepting training data. Our framework addresses two important issues: i) it handles redundancy between different images which is crucial when batch-mode selection is performed; and ii) we pose batch-selection as a submodular function optimization problem that makes an inherently intractable problem efficient to solve, while having approximation guarantees. We show results on image classification data in which our approach substantially reduces the amount of training required over the baseline.",23
icra,None,Learning physically-instantiated game play through visual observation,"Andrei Barbu,Siddharth Narayanaswamy,Jeffrey Mark Siskind,","We present an integrated vision and robotic system that plays, and learns to play, simple physically-instantiated board games that are variants of TIC TAC TOE and HEXA-PAWN. We employ novel custom vision and robotic hardware designed specifically for this learning task. The game rules can be parametrically specified. Two independent computational agents alternate playing the two opponents with the shared vision and robotic hardware, using pre-specified rule sets. A third independent computational agent, sharing the same hardware, learns the game rules solely by observing the physical play, without access to the pre-specified rule set, using inductive logic programming with minimal background knowledge possessed by human children. The vision component of our integrated system reliably detects the position of the board in the image and reconstructs the game state after every move, from a single image. The robotic component reliably moves pieces both between board positions and to and from off-board positions as needed by an arbitrary parametrically-specified legal-move generator. Thus the rules of games learned solely by observing physical play can drive further physical play. We demonstrate our system learning to play six different games.",27
icra,None,Inferring the semantics of direction signs in public places,"Jérôme Maye,Luciano Spinello,Rudolph Triebel,Roland Siegwart,","Most large-scale public environments provide direction signs to facilitate the orientation for humans and to find their way to a goal location in the environment. Thus, for a robot operating in the same environment, it would be beneficial to interpret such signs correctly for a safe and efficient navigation. In this work, we propose a novel approach to infer the meaning of direction signs and to use that for navigation, i.e., to find a mapping of a detected sign to a motion direction. Our method uses a hierarchical extension of the Implicit Shape Model framework called HISM that does not require any hand-labeled training data to detect the signs. On the lower level of this two-stage hierarchy, ISM is applied to image descriptors as in the standard approach. On the higher level, ISM operates on subparts of signs called tokens, using weights learned from data. The interpretation of the signs is inferred by associating navigation data to direction instructions. We conducted experiments from image data acquired in an airport terminal, aiming towards the implementation of a robotic guide, with promising results.",8

icra,None,RANSAC matching: Simultaneous registration and segmentation,"Shao-Wen Yang,Chieh-Chih Wang,Chun-Hua Chang,","The iterative closest points (ICP) algorithm is widely used for ego-motion estimation in robotics, but subject to bias in the presence of outliers. We propose a random sample consensus (RANSAC) based algorithm to simultaneously achieving robust and realtime ego-motion estimation, and multi-scale segmentation in environments with rapid changes. Instead of directly sampling on measurements, RANSAC matching investigates initial estimates at the object level of abstraction for systematic sampling and computational efficiency. A soft segmentation method using a multi-scale representation is exploited to eliminate segmentation errors. By explicitly taking into account the various noise sources degrading the effectiveness of geometric alignment: sensor noise, dynamic objects and data association uncertainty, the uncertainty of a relative pose estimate is calculated under a theoretical investigation of scoring in the RANSAC paradigm. The improved segmentation can also be used as the basis for higher level scene understanding. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively through extensive experiments using real data.",50

We provide a detailed description of all system components along with an accuracy evaluation and a time profiling result for the pose estimation method. Additionally, we show how the system is integrated with an existing micro-scale UAS and provide results of experimental autonomous flight tests.

icra,None,Vision-based navigation with pose recovery under visual occlusion and kidnapping,"Jungho Kim,In-So Kweon,","Vision-based robotic applications such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), global localization, and autonomous navigation have suffered from problems related to dynamic environments involving moving objects and kidnapping. One of the possible solutions to these problems is to establish robust correspondences when obtaining images from static scenes. Therefore we propose an efficient technique for determining correspondences to recover the current camera pose; in the proposed method, the FAST corner detector and SIFT descriptors are combined because in many methods for vision-based robotic applications, corner features have been adopted since they enable fast computation and simplify the computation of the correspondences between consecutive images. However, to recover the pose of the camera after kidnapping or at an unknown initial position, a robust feature matching algorithm is required because the pose of a camera is unlikely to be the same as the poses in the database images. For this purpose, first, we determine some candidates for correspondences by combining corners with their multiple descriptors computed from previously defined scales, and then we select one of these candidates by optimizing the scale using a variant of the mean-shift algorithm. We apply the proposed matching algorithm to kidnapping and visual occlusion problems in autonomous navigation.",7

It is possible to recover the camera rotations using vanishing points of parallel line sets. We then estimate the translations from known rotations and line images on the spheres. The algorithm has been validated on simulated data and real images. This vision-based estimation approach can be applied in navigation of autonomous robots besides the conventional devices such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). It helps vision-based localization of a single robot or recovery of relative positions among multiple robots equipped with different types of cameras.",10

Furthermore, using the estimate of the source location, the Gaussian process model allows for prediction of received signal strength with confidence bounds in regions of the environment that have not been explored. Finally, we develop a control law for collecting samples of the signal strength with mobile robots that allows for online estimation of the radio signal source.",129
icra,None,Estimation of communication signal strength in robotic networks,"Yasamin Mostofi,Mehrzad Malmirchegini,Alireza Ghaffarkhah,","In this paper we consider estimating the spatial variations of a wireless channel based on a small number of measurements in a robotic network. We use a multi-scale probabilistic model in order to characterize the channel and develop an estimator based on this model. We show that our model-based approach can estimate the channel well for several scenarios, with only a small number of gathered measurements. We furthermore consider a sparsity-based channel estimation approach, in which we utilize the compressibility of the channel in the frequency domain. Our results show that this approach can also be effective in several scenarios. We then discuss the underlying tradeoffs between the two approaches. For the model-based approach, we show the impact of the error in the underlying model as well as the error in the estimation of the parameters of the model on the overall performance. For the sparsity-based approach, we show the impact of channel compressibility on the performance. Overall, the proposed framework can be utilized for communication-aware motion planning in robotic networks, where a prediction of the link qualities is needed.",92

In this paper, we study the problem of computing motion strategies for robotic routers in such scenarios, as well as the minimum number of robotic routers necessary to enact our motion strategies. Assuming that the routers are as fast as the user, we present an optimal solution for cases where the environment is a simply-connected polygon, a constant factor approximation for cases where the environment has a single obstacle, and an O(h) approximation for cases where the environment has h circular obstacles. The O(h) approximation also holds for cases where the environment has h arbitrary polygonal obstacles, provided they satisfy certain geometric constraints - e.g. when the set of their minimum bounding circles is disjoint.",20

We introduce a control scheme for such semi-autonomous networks, involving excitation of the network by the external agents, with the objective of manipulating or steering the network. In this context, we consider the situation where the external agents deliver a constant mean control signal. We proceed to examine the resultant mean and covariance of the network output and relate these quantities to circuit-theoretic notions of the network, quantifying the network's amenability to external signals. Four protocols for tree graphs, to promote and deter convergence and to increase and reduce average variance within the network are then presented. These protocols involve decentralized local edge swaps that can be performed in parallel and asynchronously.",11

Julian,Daniela Rus,","We develop a distributed controller to position a team of aerial vehicles in a configuration that optimizes communication-link quality, to support a team of ground vehicles performing a collaborative task. We propose a gradient-based control approach where agents' positions locally minimize a physically motivated cost function. The contributions of this paper are threefold. We formulate of a cost function that incorporates a continuous, physical model of signal quality, SIR. We develop a non-smooth gradient-based controller that positions aerial vehicles to acheive optimized signal quality amongst all vehicles in the system. This controller is provably convergent while allowing for non-differentiability due to agents moving in or out of communication with one another. Lastly, we guarantee that given certain initial conditions or certain values of the control parameters, aerial vehicles will never disconnect the connectivity graph. We demonstrate our controller on hardware experiments using AscTec Hummingbird quadrotors and provide aggregate results over 10 trials.

icra,None,Path planning based on fluid mechanics for mobile robots using unstructured terrain models,"David Gingras,Érick Dupuis,Guy Payre,Jean de Lafontaine,","Mobile robots using a 360° field of view LIDAR ranging sensor can generate enormous 3D point clouds. To reduce the quantity of data in memory a compression can lead to unstructured environment models such as irregular meshes. This kind of structure can contain deformed cells and the path planning can be cumbersome. This paper presents a path planning method based on fluid mechanics able to deal with unstructured terrain models. The algorithm uses the finite element method to compute a velocity potential function free from local minima. Then, several streamlines are computed as a road map and the optimal path is selected among the candidate paths. The approach is implemented on the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Mars Robotics Testbed (MRT) rover and tested at the CSA Mars Emulation Terrain (MET).

The main idea is a two-level hierarchy combining a global planner which provides rough guidance to a local planner. We place a premium on fast response, so the global planner achieves speed by using a very rough approximation of the robot kinematics, and the local planner begins execution of the next action even without considering subsequent actions in detail, instead relying on the guidance of the global planner. The system exhibits few planning delays, and yet is surprisingly effective at planning collision free motions. The system is deployed on HERB, combining a Segway mobile platform, a WAM arm, and a Barrett hand. The navigation and manipulation components have been tested on the real robot, and the task of simultaneously approaching and grasping a bottle on a countertop was demonstrated in simulation.",32

icra,None,Planning short paths with clearance using explicit corridors,"Roland Geraerts,","A central problem of applications dealing with virtual environments is planning a collision-free path for a character. Since environments and their characters are growing more realistic, a character's path needs to be visually convincing, meaning that the path is smooth, short, has some clearance to the obstacles in the environment, and avoids other characters. Up to now, it has proved difficult to meet these criteria simultaneously and in real-time. We introduce a new data structure, i.e. the Explicit Corridor Map, which allows creating the shortest path, the path that has the largest amount of clearance, or any path in between. Besides being efficient, the corresponding algorithms are surprisingly simple. By integrating the data structure and algorithms into the Indicative Route Method, we show that visually convincing short paths can be obtained in real-time.",180

Bishop,Patric Jensfelt,",In this paper we address the problem of simultaneous object class and pose estimation using nothing more than object class label measurements from a generic object classifier. We detail a method for designing a likelihood function over the robot configuration space. This function provides a likelihood measure of an object being of a certain class given that the robot (from some position) sees and recognizes an object as being of some (possibly different) class. Using this likelihood function in a recursive Bayesian framework allows us to achieve a kind of spatial averaging and determine the object pose (up to certain ambiguities to be made precise). We show how inter-class confusion from certain robot viewpoints can actually increase the ability to determine the object pose. Our approach is motivated by the idea of minimalistic sensing since we use only class label measurements albeit we attempt to estimate the object pose in addition to the class.,3
icra,None,Pose estimation in heavy clutter using a multi-flash camera,"Ming-Yu Liu,Oncel Tuzel,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Rama Chellappa,,,","We propose a novel solution to object detection, localization and pose estimation with applications in robot vision. The proposed method is especially applicable when the objects of interest may not be richly textured and are immersed in heavy clutter. We show that a multi-flash camera (MFC) provides accurate separation of depth edges and texture edges in such scenes. Then, we reformulate the problem, as one of finding matches between the depth edges obtained in one or more MFC images to the rendered depth edges that are computed offline using 3D CAD model of the objects. In order to facilitate accurate matching of these binary depth edge maps, we introduce a novel cost function that respects both the position and the local orientation of each edge pixel. This cost function is significantly superior to traditional Chamfer cost and leads to accurate matching even in heavily cluttered scenes where traditional methods are unreliable. We present a sub-linear time algorithm to compute the cost function using techniques from 3D distance transforms and integral images. Finally, we also propose a multi-view based pose-refinement algorithm to improve the estimated pose.

icra,None,A probabilistic framework for stereo-vision based 3D object search with 6D pose estimation,"Jeremy Ma,Joel W. Burdick,","This paper presents a method whereby an autonomous mobile robot can search for a 3-dimensional (3D) object using an on-board stereo camera sensor mounted on a pan-tilt head. Search efficiency is realized by the combination of a coarse-scale global search coupled with a fine-scale local search. A grid-based probability map is initially generated using the coarse search, which is based on the color histogram of the desired object. Peaks in the probability map are visited in sequence, where a local (refined) search method based on 3D SIFT features is applied to establish or reject the existence of the desired object, and to update the probability map using Bayesian recursion methods. Once found, the 6D object pose is also estimated. Obstacle avoidance during search can be naturally integrated into the method. Experimental results obtained from the use of this method on a mobile robot are presented to illustrate and validate the approach, confirming that the search strategy can be carried out with modest computation.",15

Okamura,","Insertion velocity, tip asymmetry, and shaft diameter may influence steerable needle insertion paths in soft tissue. In this paper we examine the effects of these variables on needle paths in ex vivo goat liver, and demonstrate practical applications of robotic needle steering for ablation, biopsy, and brachytherapy. All experiments were performed using a new portable needle steering robot that steers asymmetric-tip needles under fluoroscopic imaging. For bevel-tip needles, we found that larger diameter needles resulted in less curvature, i.e. less steerability, confirming previous experiments in artificial tissue. The needles steered with radii of curvature ranging from 3.4 cm (for the most steerable pre-bent needle) to 2.97 m (for the least steerable bevel needle). Pre-bend angle significantly affected needle curvature, but bevel angle did not. We hypothesize that biological tissue characteristics such as inhomogeneity and viscoelasticity significantly increase path variability. These results underscore the need for closed-loop image guidance for needle steering in biological tissues with complex internal structure.",56

We propose an apprenticeship learning approach that has potential to allow robotic surgical assistants to autonomously execute specific trajectories with superhuman performance in terms of speed and smoothness. In the first step, we record a set of trajectories using human-guided backdriven motions of the robot. These are then analyzed to extract a smooth reference trajectory, which we execute at gradually increasing speeds using a variant of iterative learning control. We evaluate this approach on two representative tasks using the Berkeley Surgical Robots: a figure eight trajectory and a two handed knot-tie, a tedious suturing sub-task required in many surgical procedures. Results suggest that the approach enables (i) rapid learning of trajectories, (ii) smoother trajectories than the human-guided trajectories, and (iii) trajectories that are 7 to 10 times faster than the best human-guided trajectories.",231
icra,None,Planning active cannula configurations through tubular anatomy,"Lisa A. Lyons,Robert J. Webster,Ron Alterovitz,","Medical procedures such as lung biopsy and brachytherapy require maneuvering through tubular structures such as the trachea and bronchi to reach clinical targets. We introduce a new method to plan configurations for active cannulas, medical devices composed of thin, pre-curved, telescoping lumens that are capable of following controlled, curved paths through open or liquid-filled cavities. Planning optimal configurations for these devices is challenging due to their complex kinematics, which involve both beam mechanics and space curves. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based planning algorithm that computes active cannula configurations through tubular structures that reach specified targets. Given the target location, the start position and orientation, and a geometric representation of the physical environment extracted from pre-procedure medical images, the planner optimizes insertion length and orientation angle of each lumen of the active cannula. The planner models active cannula kinematics using a physically-based simulation that incorporates beam mechanics and minimizes energy. The algorithm typically computes plans in less than 2 minutes on a standard PC. We apply the method in simulation to anatomy extracted from a human CT scan and demonstrate configurations for a 5-lumen active cannula that maneuver it through the bronchi to targets in the lung.",70
icra,None,Toward automated tissue retraction in robot-assisted surgery,"Sachin Patil,Ron Alterovitz,","Robotic surgical assistants are enhancing physician performance, enabling physicians to perform more delicate and precise minimally invasive surgery. However, these devices are currently tele-operated and lack autonomy. In this paper, we present initial steps toward automating a commonly performed surgical task, tissue retraction, which involves grasping and lifting a thin layer of tissue to expose an underlying area. Given a model of tissues in the vicinity, our method computes a motion plan for a 6-DOF gripper that grasps a tissue flap at an optimal location and retracts it such that an underlying target is fully visible. The planner considers three optimization objectives relevant to medical applications: minimizing the maximum deformation energy, minimizing maximum stress, and minimizing the control effort in lifting the tissue flap. The planner can be used to locally improve physician specified retraction trajectories based on the optimization criteria or to compute a de novo plan. We use a physically-based simulation to compute equilibrium configurations of the tissue flap subject to manipulation constraints. These configurations are used with a sampling-based planner to explore the space of deformations and compute an optimal plan subject to discretization and modeling error. Our experimental results illustrate the ability of the method to compute retractions for heterogeneous tissues while avoiding obstacles and minimizing tissue damage.",38

In this methodology, two control scenarios are presented: a damping force acts on a moving robot as the external interaction force, (I) only when its preceding robot(s) is/are stopping or being congested and (II) when a robot exists in front of the moving robot, in order not to become involved in the congestion. This paper deals with a circuit and a robotic manufacturing-transportation system for industrial automation.

These proposed VM architectures are mainly applied for conjecturing single-stage or direct processing quality. However, the processing quality of some of manufacturing processes cannot be measured directly. Those single-stage VM architectures may not be applied to handle this indirect VM problem accurately. To properly handle this indirect VM problem, the paper proposes a dual-stage indirect VM architecture (DIVMA), which involves two process tools, to handle the indirect VM problem. In Stage I, the direct VM model of the fore-tool is established as usual, and then the indirect VM model of the rear-tool is built in Stage II that involves the Stage-I VM output. The concept of virtual cassette is also proposed in the paper. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process of a fifth generation TFT-LCD fab in Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation (CMO), Taiwan is adopted to test and compare the conjecture accuracy without and with the virtual cassette and the proposed DIVMA.

In such a model, the product quality is a function of the transition probabilities characterizing the changes among good and defective states (where good quality or defective parts are produced during a cycle, respectively). A transition that has the largest impact on quality, i.e., whose improvement will lead to the largest improvement in quality, is defined as the quality bottleneck transition (BN-t). Analytical expressions of sensitivity of quality with respect to transition probabilities are derived. Indicators to identify bottleneck transitions based on the data collected on the factory floor are developed.

The design of force or torque controlled actuators typically revolves around developing the best possible software control strategy. However, the passive dynamics of the mechanical system, including inertia, stiffness, damping and torque limits, often impose performance limitations that cannot be overcome with software control. Discussions about the passive dynamics are often imprecise, lacking comprehensive details about the physical limitations. In this paper, we develop relationships between an actuator's passive dynamics and the resulting performance, for the purpose of better understanding how to tune the passive dynamics for a force control task. We present two distinct scenarios for the actuator system and calculate the required input to produce a desired output. These exact solutions provide a basis for understanding how the parameters of the mechanical system affect the overall system's bandwidth limit.

The multi-disc brake provides resistive torque through a stack of friction discs which are compressed by a dc-motor-driven ball screw. Unlike nearly all other proportional brakes, which operate in a normally unlocked mode, the brake presented here is designed such that it may be configured in either a normally unlocked or normally locked mode. The latter enables lower electrical energy consumption and added safety in the event of electrical power failure in certain applications.

This fosters an intense research on novel energy transduction methods. In particular, propellant-based chemical actuators, able to directly convert chemical energy into mechanical energy, appear very promising, although their potential in robotics has not yet been deeply investigated. This work focuses on H 2 O 2 , used as propellant for actuators. This chemical was first used in robotics, with excellent results, by Goldfarb and collaborators, in 2003. H 2 O 2 dissociation is strongly exothermic, which generates important design issues when the actuated machine operates in close proximity to the human body. In this paper it is shown that: 1) is possible to operate the decomposition process at acceptable temperature, by means of basic solutions of hydrogen peroxide; 2) for basic pH solutions, tin becomes an effective catalyst for H 2 O 2 dissociation.

icra,None,A multiple SMA hybrid actuator to generate expressions on the face,"Dushyantha Jayatilake,Kenji Suzuki,","This paper presents part of an on-going project to design a wearable supportive device to enhance facial expressiveness, in particular for the facial paralyzed patients. Earlier we introduced the SMA actuator based Robot Mask that can be used to enhance the expressiveness of the face. The basic concept of that design was pulling of the skin through wires attached to the face and we explained the human anatomy based criteria of selecting these pulling points and directions. The major reason to use SMA instead of traditional actuators such as motors was their silent acting nature. However, their dynamic properties been governed by thermal energy and their mechanical properties been affected by the hysteresis due to their metallurgy, SMA based actuators tend not to perform too well under cooling. This paper introduces a novel controlling scenario that use the actuation of only a limited number of SMA wires out of the total connected in series on either sides of a slider to control the direction and amount of movement of the slider. The advantage of this method is by keeping some SMA wires at low temperatures it was possible to achieve a high speed of actuation even when the direction of motion was changed. This paper also investigates on the amount of actuation rates that are required to generate natural looking smiles and later attempts to recreate them using the proposed actuation unit.",4
icra,None,"MoonWalker, a lower limb exoskeleton able to sustain bodyweight using a passive force balancer","Sébastien Krut,Michel Benoit,Etienne Dombre,François Pierrot,","This paper presents MoonWalker, a lower limb exoskeleton able to sustain part of a user's bodyweight. This orthosis can be used for rehabilitation, to help people having weak legs, or to help those suffering from a broken leg, to walk. It can also be used as an assistive device helping people carrying heavy loads. Its main characteristic is that a passive force balancer provides the force to sustain bodyweight. An actuator is also required, but is used only to shift that force the same side as the leg in stance. Consequently, MoonWalker requires very low energy to work on flat terrains. That motor can provide also a part of the energy to climb stairs or slopes. We believe that this approach can help improving energetic autonomy of lower limb exoskeletons.",92

Caldwell,","This paper presents the control architecture and preliminary experimental results of a high performance parallel robot used for ankle rehabilitation. The goal of this work was to design suitable control algorithms for diagnostic, training and rehabilitation of the ankle in presence of musculoskeletal injuries. A position control scheme is used for patient-passive exercises while an admittance control technique is used to perform patient-active exercises with and without motion assistance. The design of the control algorithms is based on the analysis of the rehabilitation protocol taking into account the dynamics of the system and the dynamics of the interaction between the human and the robot.

icra,None,Biomimetic optic flow sensing applied to a lunar landing scenario,"Florent Valette,Franck Ruffier,Stéphane Viollet,Tobias Seidl,","Autonomous landing on unknown extraterrestrial bodies requires fast, noise-resistant motion processing to elicit appropriate steering commands. Flying insects excellently master visual motion sensing techniques to cope with highly parallel data at a low energy cost, using dedicated motion processing circuits. Results obtained in neurophysiological, behavioural, and biorobotic studies on insect flight control were used to safely land a spacecraft on the Moon in a simulated environment. ESA's Advanced Concepts Team has identified autonomous lunar landing as a relevant situation for testing the potential applications of innovative bio-inspired visual guidance systems to space missions. Biomimetic optic flow-based strategies for controlling automatic landing were tested in a very realistic simulated Moon environment. Visual information was provided using the PANGU software program and used to regulate the optic flow generated during the landing of a two degrees of freedom spacecraft. The results of the simulation showed that a single elementary motion detector coupled to a regulator robustly controlled the autonomous descent and the approach of the simulated moonlander. “Low gate” located approximately 10 m above the ground was reached with acceptable vertical and horizontal speeds of 4 m/s and 5 m/s, respectively. It was also established that optic flow sensing methods can be used successfully to cope with temporary sensor blinding and poor lighting conditions.",45
icra,None,Experimental results of a novel amphibian solution for aquatic robot,"Liang Ju,Gabriele Ferri,Cecilia Laschi,Barbara Mazzolai,Paolo Dario,","Water, recognized as one of the most important and endangered resources to mankind, is very difficult to monitor in real time using conventional methods. Thanks to recent advancements in technology, the use of robots, able to fulfill missions such as sampling from aquatic environments, becomes feasible and can increase dramatically the quality of water monitoring. Due to the complications for the robot's movement in some aquatic scenarios, for instance, shallow waters or dry banks of rivers and lakes, amphibian locomotion appears to be necessary to guarantee a satisfying coverage of the monitoring activities in such areas. In this paper, we focus on developing a practical amphibian solution by introducing a pair of screw rotors, which rotate in opposite directions to generate locomotion on the ground. The primitive idea of this novel design is to enhance the versatility of a marine robot with a terrestrial locomotion without undermining its performance during the movements in the water. In particular, we elaborate the principle of this novel design and present some test results of a prototype on selected terrain types, which are similar to the target aquatic environment. We conclude the paper with some preliminary conclusions based on the analysis of the test results about effectiveness and efficiency issues.",4
icra,None,Two steps natural actor critic learning for underwater cable tracking,"Andres El-Fakdi,Marc Carreras,Enric Galceran,","This paper proposes a field application of a high-level Reinforcement Learning (RL) control system for solving the action selection problem of an autonomous robot in a cable tracking task. The underwater vehicle ICTINEU AUV learns to perform a visual based cable tracking task in a two step learning process. First, a policy is computed by means of simulation where a hydrodynamic model of the vehicle simulates the cable following task. Once the simulated results are accurate enough, in a second step, the learned-in-simulation policy is transferred to the vehicle where the learning procedure continues in a real environment, improving the initial policy. The natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm has been selected to solve the problem in both steps. This algorithm aims to take advantage of policy gradient and value function techniques for fast convergence. Actor's policy gradient gives convergence guarantees under function approximation and partial observability while critic's value function reduces variance of the estimates update improving the convergence process.",10
icra,None,Visually aided feature extraction from 3D range data,"Chhay Sok,Martin D. Adams,","Robust feature extraction within 3D environments is a crucial requirement for many autonomous robotic and tracking applications. 3D Laser range finders and cameras provide extremely rich data about an environment. However, the algorithms which attempt to compress the vast data sets produced by these sensors into features, tend to be fragile in the presence of sensor noise, or computationally expensive. This paper presents a 3D feature extraction technique which greatly compresses 3D range data based on principal component analysis (PCA). PCA can provide a greatly compressed vector set, representing the dominant directions of data points, thus grouping them into planes or lines. It is shown however, that the naive application of PCA to full, 3D, point cloud data sets, results in a poor representation of the dominant data directions. Therefore, a combination of a panoramic camera and 3D laser range finder is used to extract robust planes from 3D range data. The panoramic camera image is first filtered with the Mean Shift algorithm to smooth segments within it, whilst preserving the integrity of the segment edges. These segments are then used to guide the PCA, through an approximate image to range space calibration, to act on the corresponding individual segments of range data. The application of PCA to segmented subsets of 3D point cloud data sets, will be shown to be robust for the detection of planes in both indoor and urban, outdoor environments.",8
icra,None,Real-time surface slope estimation by homography alignment for spacecraft safe landing,"Yang Cheng,","This paper offers a real-time approach for simultaneously determining spacecraft motion and multiple 3D planar surfaces for spacecraft safe landing. The approach contains three algorithms: a multiple homography alignment algorithm, which constructs homographies under unified epipolar geometry; a closed-form motion estimation algorithm; and a simple routine for surface slope estimation. This approach has three significant advantages: first, it works well for both a simple planar scene and more complex 3D world containing many smaller planar surfaces; second, it decomposes a very large optimization problem into much smaller sub-problems that are computationally less expensive. This computational advantage means that this approach can be exploited in real time robotic operations such as during time critical spacecraft landing. Finally, this approach is very reliable and accurate. The effectiveness of this approach is determined quantitatively through extensive simulations and qualitatively with actual images.",17
icra,None,Human-guided grasp measures improve grasp robustness on physical robot,"Ravi Balasubramanian,Ling Xu,Peter D. Brook,Joshua R. Smith,,","Humans are adept at grasping different objects robustly for different tasks. Robotic grasping has made significant progress, but still has not reached the level of robustness or versatility shown by human grasping. It would be useful to understand what parameters (called grasp measures) humans optimize as they grasp objects, how these grasp measures are varied for different tasks, and whether they can be applied to physical robots to improve their robustness and versatility. This paper demonstrates a new way to gather human-guided grasp measures from a human interacting haptically with a robotic arm and hand. The results revealed that a human-guided strategy provided grasps with higher robustness on a physical robot even under a vigorous shaking test (91%) when compared with a state-of-the-art automated grasp synthesis algorithm (77%). Furthermore, orthogonality of wrist orientation was identified as a key human-guided grasp measure, and using it along with an automated grasp synthesis algorithm improved the automated algorithm's results dramatically (77% to 93%).",82

In this paper we propose a new approach for the visual tracking of a robot hand suitable to observe the interaction between robot and object. It consists on the continuous vision-based recovery of the articular pose of the robot hand. It is based on the principles of virtual visual servoing, which allows to deal with articulated bodies and occlusions. Its suitability is shown by tracking a parallel jaw gripper under different conditions such as self-occlusion, articulated motion and important changes in the point-of-view. The potential applications range from estimating the robot hand articulated pose under poor hand-eye calibration and joint feedback, until detecting deficient contact configurations, incipient slips, etc.",12

Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in the context of folding a towel using a general-purpose two-armed mobile robotic platform without the use of specialized end-effectors or tools. The robot begins by picking up a randomly dropped towel from a table, goes through a sequence of vision-based re-grasps and manipulations-partially in the air, partially on the table-and finally stacks the folded towel in a target location. The reliability and robustness of our algorithm enables for the first time a robot with general purpose manipulators to reliably and fully-autonomously fold previously unseen towels, demonstrating success on all 50 out of 50 single-towel trials as well as on a pile of 5 towels.",449

icra,None,Implicit nonlinear complementarity: A new approach to contact dynamics,"Emanuel Todorov,","Contact dynamics are commonly formulated as a linear complementarity problem. While this approach is superior to earlier spring-damper models, it can be inaccurate due to pyramid approximations to the friction cone, and inefficient due to lack of convexity coupled with a large number of auxiliary variables. Here we propose a new approach: implicit complementarity. Instead of treating contact velocities and forces as independent variables subject to explicit complementarity constraints, we express them as functions of a minimal set of unconstrained variables, and design these functions so that the complementarity constraints are automatically satisfied. We then solve the equations of motion via a non-smooth Gauss-Newton method augmented with an original linesearch procedure which exploits the problem structure. This enables us to represent the friction cone exactly and to reduce the number of unknowns by about a factor of 3. Numerical tests suggest that, in usage scenarios typical for robotics, the solver takes only about 5 iterations even without warm starts. More extensive tests and side-by-side comparisons remain to be done, but nevertheless the potential of the new approach is clear.",34

Applications of such a system includes quality assurance and estimating surface friction during manipulation tasks. A naive Bayes classifier is used to distinguish textures sensed by a bio-inspired artificial finger. The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensity of vibrations in the silicone. Textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger is pre-processed and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to learn a classifier for different textures. The performance of the classifier is evaluated against a naive time domain based learner. Preliminary results show that our classifier performs better.",85

We propose a hybrid velocity-force controller, that grasps an object safely and reveals at the same time its deformation properties. As an application, we show that a robot can use these features to distinguish the open/closed and fill state of bottles and cans - purely from tactile sensing - from a small training set. To prove that this is a hard recognition problem, we also conducted a comperative study with 17 human test subjects.

This allows the planar tactile sensor patches to optimally adjust themselves to the object's surface and to acquire additional sensor information for shape reconstruction. Secondly, this paper presents an approach to classify an object directly from the haptic sensor data acquired by a palpation sequence with the robot hand - without building a 3d-model of the object. Therefore, a finite set of essential finger positions and tactile contact patterns are identified which can be used to describe a single palpation step. A palpation sequence can then be merged into a simple statistical description of the object and finally be classified. The proposed approach for haptic object recognition and the new tactile sensor system are evaluated with an anthropomorphic robot hand.",112

We hypothesized that human's perception of weight due to inertial force might be different from the perceived weight due to gravitational force for lifting an object with a power assist robot. We established psychophysical relationships between the actual weights and the power-assisted weights for the objects lifted with the robot, and also determined the excess in load forces that the subjects applied for three independent lifting schemes or grasp configurations: (i) unimanual lift, (ii) bimanual lift, and (iii) cooperative lift. We also compared the weight perceptual and load force features for the unimanual lifts to that for the bimanual and cooperative lifts. We then modified the power-assist control using a novel control strategy based on the weight perceptual and load force features. The control modification reduced the excessive load forces applied by the subjects in each lifting scheme and thus enhanced maneuverability, naturalness, ease of use, stability, safety etc. of the robot system significantly. Finally, we proposed using the findings to design human-friendly power assist robots for carrying heavy objects in various industries.",26

To achieve power-assist motion properly, the PI control, which is based on the pressure value from the balloon sensor, is performed. This sensor makes the applied part free from electricity. To evaluate the validity of glove, the skin surface electromyography (EMG) signals of muscles are measured during grasping. These results demonstrate that the effectiveness of the power amplified glove.",109
icra,None,Learning reliable and efficient navigation with a humanoid,"Stefan Oßwald,Armin Hornung,Maren Bennewitz,","Reliable and efficient navigation with a humanoid robot is a difficult task. First, the motion commands are executed rather inaccurately due to backlash in the joints or foot slippage. Second, the observations are typically highly affected by noise due to the shaking behavior of the robot. Thus, the localization performance is typically reduced while the robot moves and the uncertainty about its pose increases. As a result, the reliable and efficient execution of a navigation task cannot be ensured anymore since the robot's pose estimate might not correspond to the true location. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning approach to select appropriate navigation actions for a humanoid robot equipped with a camera for localization. The robot learns to reach the destination reliably and as fast as possible, thereby choosing actions to account for motion drift and trading off velocity in terms of fast walking movements against accuracy in localization. We present extensive simulated and practical experiments with a humanoid robot and demonstrate that our learned policy significantly outperforms a hand-optimized navigation strategy.",44

By the opto-acoustic scene analysis, the guided and autonomous exploration of the environment by means of acoustic and/or visual perception is meant. On the one hand, the perception ability is necessary to interact with humans in a humanoid way. On the other hand, the proximity of the robot has to be analyzed continuously, in order to enable the robot to fulfill its everyday tasks. Thereby, the greatest challenge lies in the wide variety of different perception tasks, e.g. detection, tracking, and identification of persons and different types of objects.

Its applicability to complex motor systems, however, has been largely impossible so far due to the computational difficulties that reinforcement learning encounters in high dimensional continuous state-action spaces. In this paper, we derive a novel approach to RL for parameterized control policies based on the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals. While solidly grounded in optimal control theory and estimation theory, the update equations for learning are surprisingly simple and have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a real-world scenario. We believe that our new algorithm, Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI 2 ), offers currently one of the most efficient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL in robotics.",303

So this model is scalable architecture. The motion language model and the natural language model can be integrated since both models are represented graphically. The integration of the motion language model and the natural language model allows robots not only to interpret motion patterns as sentences but also to generate motions from sentences. This paper demonstrates the validity of our proposed framework even in the case that large-scale word corpus is needed processing through experiments of interpreting motion patterns as sentences and generating motion patterns from sentences.",8

The novel accumulator voting scheme is called ""Parametric Transform for Multi-lane Detection"".

On the first excursion through an environment, the system builds a topological representation of the robot's exploration path, encoded as a place graph. On subsequent navigation missions, the method localizes the robot within the graph and provides robust guidance to a specified destination.

Sagüés,","This paper presents a new method for visual homing to be used on a robot moving on the ground plane. A relevant issue in vision-based navigation is the field-of-view constraints of conventional cameras. We overcome this problem by means of omnidirectional vision and we propose a vision-based homing control scheme that relies on the 1D trifocal tensor. The technique employs a reference set of images of the environment previously acquired at different locations and the images taken by the robot during its motion. In order to take advantage of the qualities of omnidirectional vision, we define a purely angle-based approach, without requiring any distance information. This approach, taking the planar motion constraint into account, motivates the use of the 1D trifocal tensor. In particular, the additional geometric constraints enforced by the tensor improve the robustness of the method in the presence of mismatches. The interest of our proposal is that the designed control scheme computes the robot velocities only from angular information, being this very precise information; in addition, we present a procedure that computes the angular relations between all the views even if they are not directly related by feature matches. The feasibility of the proposed approach is supported by the stability analysis and the results from simulations and experiments with real images.",19

One approach to scaling to large numbers of modules is to simplify module design by relieving the modules of the typical power, control, and actuation requirements necessary for locomotion. Assembly is accomplished by taking advantage of stochastic environmental motions to move the modules into place.

icra,None,Constrained closed loop inverse kinematics,"Behzad Dariush,Youding Zhu,Arjun Arumbakkam,Kikuo Fujimura,","This paper introduces a kinematically constrained closed loop inverse kinematics algorithm for motion control of robots or other articulated rigid body systems. The proposed strategy utilizes gradients of collision and joint limit potential functions to arrive at an appropriate weighting matrix to penalize and dampen motion approaching constraint surfaces. The method is particularly suitable for self collision avoidance of highly articulated systems which may have multiple collision points among several segment pairs. In that respect, the proposed method has a distinct advantage over existing gradient projection based methods which rely on numerically unstable null-space projections when there are multiple intermittent constraints. We also show how this approach can be augmented with a previously reported method based on redirection of constraints along virtual surface manifolds. The hybrid strategy is effective, robust, and does not require parameter tuning. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for a self collision avoidance problem where the reference motion is obtained from human observations. We show simulation and experimental results on the humanoid robot ASIMO.",27
icra,None,A skill-based motion planning framework for humanoids,"Marcelo Kallmann,Yazhou Huang,Robert Backman,","This paper presents a multi-skill motion planner which is able to sequentially synchronize parameterized motion skills in order to achieve humanoid motions exhibiting complex whole-body coordination. The proposed approach integrates sampling-based motion planning in continuous parametric spaces with discrete search over skill choices, selecting the search strategy according to the functional type of each skill being coordinated. As a result, the planner is able to sequence arbitrary motion skills (such as reaching, balance adjustment, stepping, etc) in order to achieve complex motions needed for solving humanoid reaching tasks in realistic environments. The proposed framework is applied to the HOAP-3 humanoid robot and several results are presented.",15
icra,None,High-dimensional planning on the GPU,"Joseph T. Kider,Mark Henderson,Maxim Likhachev,Alla Safonova,","Optimal heuristic searches such as A* search are commonly used for low-dimensional planning such as 2D path finding. These algorithms however, typically do not scale well to high-dimensional planning problems such as motion planning for robotic arms, computing motion trajectories for non-holonomic robotic vehicles and motion synthesis for humanoid characters. A recently developed randomized version of A* search, called R* search, scales to higher-dimensional planning problems by trading off deterministic optimality guarantees of A* for probabilistic sub-optimality guarantees. In this paper, we show that in addition to its scalability, R* lends itself well to a parallel implementation. In particular, we demonstrate how R* can be implemented on the GPU. On the theoretical side, the GPU version of R*, called R*GPU, preserves all the theoretical properties of R* including its probabilistic bounds on sub-optimality. On the experimental side, we show that R*GPU consistently produces lower cost solutions, scales better in terms of memory, and runs faster than R*. These results hold for both motion planning for a 6DOF robot arm planar as well as 2D path finding.",60
icra,None,Trajectory prediction in cluttered voxel environments,"Nikolay Jetchev,Marc Toussaint,","Trajectory planning and optimization is a fundamental problem in articulated robotics. It is often viewed as a two phase problem of initial feasible path planning around obstacles and subsequent optimization of a trajectory satisfying dynamical constraints. There are many methods that can generate good movements when given enough time, but planning for high-dimensional robot configuration spaces in realistic environments with many objects in real time remains challenging. This work presents a novel way for faster movement planning in such environments by predicting good path initializations. We build on our previous work on trajectory prediction by adapting it to environments modeled with voxel grids and defining a frame invariant prototype trajectory space. The constructed representations can generalize to a wide range of situations, allowing to predict good movement trajectories and speed up convergence of robot motion planning. An empirical comparison of the effect on planning movements with a combination of different trajectory initializations and local planners is presented and tested on a Schunk arm manipulation platform with laser sensors in simulation and hardware.",39
icra,None,Retraction-based RRT planner for articulated models,"Jia Pan,Liangjun Zhang,Dinesh Manocha,","We present a new retraction algorithm for high DOF articulated models and use our algorithm to improve the performance of RRT planners in narrow passages. The retraction step is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and performs iterative refinement on the boundary of C-Obstacle space. We also combine the retraction algorithm with decomposition planners to handle very high DOF articulated models. The performance of our approach is analyzed using Voronoi diagrams and we show that our retraction algorithm provides a good approximation to the ideal RRT-extension in constrained environments. We have implemented our algorithm and tested its performance on robots with more than 40 DOFs in complex environments. In practice, we observe significant performance (2-80X) improvement over prior RRT planners on challenging scenarios with narrow passages.",23
icra,None,Vision-based robot control with omnidirectional cameras and conformal geometric algebra,"Carlos López-Franco,Nancy Arana-Daniel,Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano,","Traditional cameras have a narrow field of view, to enlarge the field of view omnidirectional cameras can be used. In this work, we propose, a simple an elegant solution to the image formation model for omnidirectional cameras with parabolic mirrors. We propose the use of conformal geometric algebra (CGA), since the involved transformation operations in the model can be represented as an special group of multivectors. This representation is advantageous since the inversions are linearized, furthermore the transformation can be applied to all the geometric objects of the CGA. In consequence, the paracatadioptric image formation can be simplified, since the procedure is the same for points, point-pairs, lines, or circles. As an application example the control of a nonholonomic mobile robot using paracatadioptric line images and the proposed framework is described.",7
icra,None,Self-orientation of a hand-held catadioptric system in man-made environments,"L. Puig,J. Bermudez,J.J. Guerrero,","In central catadioptric systems the 3D lines are projected into conics, actually degenerate conics. In this paper we present a new approach to extract the projected lines corresponding to straight lines in the scene and to compute vanishing points from them. Using the internal calibration and two image points we are able to compute the catadioptric image lines analytically. We exploit the presence of parallel lines in man-made environments to compute the dominant vanishing points in the omnidirectional image. In order to obtain the intersection of two of these conics to compute vanishing points we analyze the self-polar triangle common to this pair. With the information contained in the vanishing points we are able to obtain the self-orientation of a hand-held catadioptric system. This system can be used in a vertical stabilization system required by autonomous navigation or to rectify images required in applications where the vertical orientation of the catadioptric system is assumed. We test our approach performing vertical and full rectifications in real sequences of images.",16
icra,None,Application of particle filters to vision-based orientation estimation using harmonic analysis,"Timo Schairer,Benjamin Huhle,Wolfgang Straßer,","We investigate the application of particle filters to estimate the orientation of a mobile agent based on an omnidirectional video stream. By applying spherical signal analysis to sequences of low resolution input images we perform a real-time estimation of the relative camera rotation. We use normalized cross-correlation computed with a fast frequency domain approach that yields unbiased estimates which can be further processed by a particle filter. We discuss the quaternion representation of the rotational state space and evaluate methods for meaningful averaging. A prototype system is presented and experiments with real image sequences show that robust estimation of the rotational motion is achievable even when the input images are corrupted, e.g. due to occlusions.",6
icra,None,Central catadioptric line matching for robotic applications,"Pascal Vasseur,Cédric Demonceaux,","This paper presents a method for catadioptric line matching across multiple images. While most of previous works deals with vertical lines and planar motion, our approach is able to match any kind of lines between two views separated by a rigid transformation without any prior knowledge of the epipolar geometry. Catadioptric lines are represented by their normals in sphere space and we use only these normals and their relative positions in order to perform the matching. A geometric hashing approach allows in the first image to construct hashing tables based on bases defined by every possible couples of normals. In the second image, a voting scheme permits to select the best corresponding bases and subsequently to match catadioptric lines.We show that the proposed representation is invariant in the case of a pure rotation and quasi-invariant for a combination of rotation and translation. We also propose different experimental results obtained in real time on real outdoor sequences.",2
icra,None,Cooperative tracking of moving objects and face detection with a dual camera sensor,"Stefano Ghidoni,Alberto Pretto,Emanuele Menegatti,","This paper describes a sensor for autonomous surveillance capable of continuously monitoring the environment, while acquiring detailed images of specific areas. This is achieved by exploiting an omnidirectional camera and a PTZ camera, assembled together on a single mount. The two cameras form a single vision sensor, since data obtained processing the two images are used in a cooperative way. This system solves the problem affecting systems based on PTZ cameras only, since it does not exist a tracking system working reliably on PTZ images: the problem is solved here by performing the tracking in the omnidirectional image. This vision sensor is used in a surveillance application, that detects moving objects, and records all the faces of the people walking close to the sensor. It could be used to navigate or instruct a security or a service mobile robot.",22
icra,None,Development of a pneumatic robot for MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy and brachytherapy: New approaches,"Sang-Eun Song,Nathan B. Cho,Gregory Fischer,Nobuhito Hata,,,,","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided prostate biopsy and brachytherapy has been introduced in order to enhance the cancer detection and treatment. For the accurate needle positioning, a number of robotic assistants have been developed. However, problems exist due to the strong magnetic field and limited workspace. Pneumatically actuated robots have shown the minimum distraction in the environment but the confined workspace limits optimal robot design and thus controllability is often poor. To overcome the problem, a simple external damping mechanism using timing belts was sought and a 1-DOF mechanism test result indicated sufficient positioning accuracy. Based on the damping mechanism and modular system design approach, a new workspace-optimized 4-DOF parallel robot was developed for the MRI-guided prostate biopsy and brachytherapy. A preliminary evaluation of the robot was conducted using previously developed pneumatic controller and satisfying results were obtained.",116
icra,None,Design and development of a 3-axis MRI-compatible force sensor,"U-Xuan Tan,Bo Yang,Rao Gullapalli,Jaydev P. Desai,","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been gaining popularity over standard imaging modalities like ultrasound and CT because of its ability to provide excellent soft-tissue contrast. However, due to the working principle of MRI, a number of conventional force sensors are not compatible. One popular solution is to develop a fiber-optic force sensor. However, the measurements along the principal axes of a number of these force sensors are highly cross-coupled. One of the objectives of this paper is to minimize this coupling effect. In addition, this paper describes the design of an elastic frame structure that is obtained systematically by an algorithm and not purely based on design intuition. We used a topology optimization technique, which has two major advantages: 1) aids engineers in design when given a constrained boundary, and 2) optimize the displacement amplification, which will in turn increase stiffness, bandwidth, and improve sensing resolution. To ensure that the frames are linked from the input to output, a solution for topology optimization is proposed. The sensor is then fabricated using plastic material (ABS) as it is one of the ideal material for MRI environment. However, the hysteresis effect seen in the displacement-load graph of plastic materials is known to affect the accuracy. Hence, this paper also proposes modeling and addressing this hysteretic effect using Prandtl-Ishlinskii play operators. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the sensor's performance, as well as its compatibility in MRI under continuous imaging.",21
icra,None,Miniaturized triaxial optical fiber force sensor for MRI-Guided minimally invasive surgery,"Pinyo Puangmali,Prokar Dasgupta,Lakmal D. Seneviratne,Kaspar Althoefer,","This paper describes the design and construction of a miniaturized triaxial force sensor which can be applied inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The sensing principle of the sensor is based on an optical intensity modulation mechanism that utilizes bent-tip optical fibers to measure the deflection of a compliant platform when exposed to a force. By measuring the deflection of the platform using this optical approach, the magnitude and direction of three orthogonal force components (F x , F y , and F z ) can be determined. The sensor prototype described in this paper demonstrates that it can perform force measurements in axial and radial directions with working ranges of +/-2 N. Since the sensor is small in size and entirely made of nonmetallic materials, it is compatible with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and safe to be deployed within magnetic resonance (MR) environments.",31
icra,None,Novel miniature MRI-compatible fiber-optic force sensor for cardiac catheterization procedures,"Panagiotis Polygerinos,Pinyo Puangmali,Tobias Schaeffter,Reza Razavi,,,","This paper presents the prototype design and development of a miniature MR-compatible fiber optic force sensor suitable for the detection of force during MR-guided cardiac catheterization. The working principle is based on light intensity modulation where a fiber optic cable interrogates a reflective surface at a predefined distance inside a catheter shaft. When a force is applied to the tip of the catheter, a force sensitive structure varies the distance and the orientation of the reflective surface with reference to the optical fiber. The visual feedback from the MRI scanner can be used to determine whether or not the catheter tip is normal or tangential to the tissue surface. In both cases the light is modulated accordingly and the axial or lateral force can be estimated. The sensor exhibits adequate linear response, having a good working range, very good resolution and good sensitivity in both axial and lateral force directions. In addition, the use of low-cost and MR-compatible materials for its development makes the sensor safe for use inside MRI environments.",85
icra,None,Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering for probing-based 6-DOF localization in robotic assembly,"Yuichi Taguchi,Tim K. Marks,Haruhisa Okuda,","This paper presents a probing-based method for probabilistic localization in automated robotic assembly. We consider peg-in-hole problems in which a needle-like peg has a single point of contact with the object that contains the hole, and in which the initial uncertainty in the relative pose (3D position and 3D angle) between the peg and the object is much greater than the required accuracy (assembly clearance). We solve this 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) localization problem using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, in which the probability distribution over the peg's pose is factorized into two components: The distribution over position (3-DOF) is represented by particles, while the distribution over angle (3-DOF) is approximated as a Gaussian distribution for each particle, updated using an extended Kalman filter. This factorization reduces the number of particles required for localization by orders of magnitude, enabling real-time online 6-DOF pose estimation. Each measurement is simply the contact position obtained by randomly repositioning the peg and moving towards the object until there is contact. To compute the likelihood of each measurement, we use as a map a mesh model of the object that is based on the CAD model but also explicitly models the uncertainty in the map. The mesh uncertainty model makes our system robust to cases in which the actual measurement is different from the expected one. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over previous methods using simulations as well as physical experiments with a robotic arm and a metal peg and object.",8
icra,None,Global localization for a small mobile robot using magnetic patterns,"Won Suk You,Byung June Choi,Bumsoo Kim,Hyungpil Moon,Ja Choon Koo,,,","In this paper, we present a global localization and local pose error compensation method in a known structured environment using magnetic landmarks. In previous our research, it was possible to compensate the pose error (x e , y e , q e ) of a mobile robot correctly on the surface of structured environment with magnetic landmarks. In this work, we propose a methodology of arranging magnetic landmarks on the map such that properly arranged magnetic patterns ease the global localization of a mobile agent. Among total six patterns of magnetic-bar in square arrangement, five unique landmarks are obtained. Therefore, a heuristic pattern search method is applied to build the virtual map using five landmarks. In order to obtain the global pose information, the robot identifies the pattern of magnets, and obtains the current global pose information by comparing the measured neighboring patterns with the map information that is saved in advance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the magnetic-pattern landmarks for the global localization and local pose control of a mobile robot.",17
icra,None,Low-cost Attitude and Heading Reference System: Filter design and experimental evaluation,"Pedro Batista,Carlos Silvestre,Paulo Oliveira,Bruno Cardeira,","This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of a low-cost Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) for autonomous vehicles. A single sensor pack, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), provides all the data required to feed the attitude filter. The design is sensor-driven and departs from traditional solutions as no explicit representations of the attitude, e.g., Euler angles, quaternions, or rotation matrices, are considered in the filter design. Moreover, the proposed solution includes the estimation of rate gyros biases, systematic tuning procedures, and also allows for the inclusion of frequency weights to model colored noise on the different sensor channels. Due to its inherent structure, the filter is complementary, allows for temporary loss of sensor measurements, and also copes well with slowly time-varying rate gyros biases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated with a low-cost IMU and resorting to a high precision calibration table, which provides ground truth signals for comparison with the resulting filter estimates.",35
icra,None,Accelerometer-based tilt estimation of a rigid body with only rotational degrees of freedom,"Sebastian Trimpe,Raffaello D'Andrea,","An estimation algorithm is developed for determining pitch and roll angles (tilt) of a rigid body fixed at a pivot point using multiple accelerometers. The estimate is independent of the rigid body dynamics; the method is applicable both in static conditions and for any dynamic motion of the body. No dynamic model is required for the estimator; only the mounting positions of the sensors need to be known. The proposed estimator is the optimal linear estimate in a least-squares sense if knowledge of the system dynamics is not used. The estimate may be used as a basis for further filtering and fusion techniques, such as sensor fusion with rate gyro data. The estimation algorithm is applied to the problem of state estimation for the Balancing Cube, a rigid structure that can actively balance on its corners. Experimental results are provided.",49

Sensors in the environment reliably detect their current positions, but it is difficult to identify people using these sensors. On the other hand, signals from wearable sensors can be used to identify people correctly, but precise position estimation remains problematic. In this paper, we describe a novel method of integrating laser range finders (LRFs) in the environment and wearable inertial sensors. Time sequences of angular velocities estimated from both LRFs and wearable sensors are matched to identify people. Examples of tracking individuals in the environment that confirm the effectiveness of this method are shown.",20
icra,None,FAB-MAP 3D: Topological mapping with spatial and visual appearance,"Rohan Paul,Paul Newman,","This paper describes a probabilistic framework for appearance based navigation and mapping using spatial and visual appearance data. Like much recent work on appearance based navigation we adopt a bag-of-words approach in which positive or negative observations of visual words in a scene are used to discriminate between already visited and new places. In this paper we add an important extra dimension to the approach. We explicitly model the spatial distribution of visual words as a random graph in which nodes are visual words and edges are distributions over distances. Care is taken to ensure that the spatial model is able to capture the multi-modal distributions of inter-word spacing and account for sensor errors both in word detection and distances. Crucially, these inter-word distances are viewpoint invariant and collectively constitute strong place signatures and hence the impact of using both spatial and visual appearance is marked. We provide results illustrating a tremendous increase in precision-recall area compared to a state-of-the-art visual appearance only systems.",163
icra,None,Real-time monocular SLAM: Why filter?,"Hauke Strasdat,J. M. M. Montiel,Andrew J. Davison,","While the most accurate solution to off-line structure from motion (SFM) problems is undoubtedly to extract as much correspondence information as possible and perform global optimisation, sequential methods suitable for live video streams must approximate this to fit within fixed computational bounds. Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM - also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) - have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.",639

The proposed approach allows us to extract redundancies across multiple demonstrations and build time-independent models to reproduce the dynamics of the demonstrated movements. The approach is systematically evaluated by using automatically generated trajectories sharing similarities with human gestures. The proposed approach is contrasted with four state-of-the-art methods previously proposed in robotics to learn and reproduce new skills by imitation. An experiment with a 7 DOFs robotic arm learning and reproducing the motion of hitting a ball with a table tennis racket is then presented to illustrate the approach.,42
icra,None,Using model knowledge for learning inverse dynamics,"Duy Nguyen-Tuong,Jan Peters,","In recent years, learning models from data has become an increasingly interesting tool for robotics, as it allows straightforward and accurate model approximation. However, in most robot learning approaches, the model is learned from scratch disregarding all prior knowledge about the system. For many complex robot systems, available prior knowledge from advanced physics-based modeling techniques can entail valuable information for model learning that may result in faster learning speed, higher accuracy and better generalization. In this paper, we investigate how parametric physical models (e.g., obtained from rigid body dynamics) can be used to improve the learning performance, and, especially, how semiparametric regression methods can be applied in this context. We present two possible semiparametric regression approaches, where the knowledge of the physical model can either become part of the mean function or of the kernel in a nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We compare the learning performance of these methods first on sampled data and, subsequently, apply the obtained inverse dynamics models in tracking control on a real Barrett WAM. The results show that the semiparametric models learned with rigid body dynamics as prior outperform the standard rigid body dynamics models on real data while generalizing better for unknown parts of the state space.",186
icra,None,Sampling-based motion planning with temporal goals,"Amit Bhatia,Lydia E. Kavraki,Moshe Y. Vardi,","This paper presents a geometry-based, multi-layered synergistic approach to solve motion planning problems for mobile robots involving temporal goals. The temporal goals are described over subsets of the workspace (called propositions) using temporal logic. A multi-layered synergistic framework has been proposed recently for solving planning problems involving significant discrete structure. In this framework, a high-level planner uses a discrete abstraction of the system and the exploration information to suggest feasible high-level plans. A low-level sampling-based planner uses the physical model of the system, and the suggested high-level plans, to explore the state-space for feasible solutions. In this paper, we advocate the use of geometry within the above framework to solve motion planning problems involving temporal goals. We present a technique to construct the discrete abstraction using the geometry of the obstacles and the propositions defined over the workspace. Furthermore, we show through experiments that the use of geometry results in significant computational speedups compared to previous work. Traces corresponding to trajectories of the system are defined employing the sampling interval used by the low-level algorithm. The applicability of the approach is shown for second-order nonlinear robot models in challenging workspace environments with obstacles, and for a variety of temporal logic specifications.",245
icra,None,Planning pre-grasp manipulation for transport tasks,"Lillian Y. Chang,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,Nancy S. Pollard,","Studies of human manipulation strategies suggest that pre-grasp object manipulation, such as rotation or sliding of the object to be grasped, can improve task performance by increasing both the task success rate and the quality of load-supporting postures. In previous demonstrations, pre-grasp object rotation by a robot manipulator was limited to manually-programmed actions. We present a method for automating the planning of pre-grasp rotation for object transport tasks. Our technique optimizes the grasp acquisition point by selecting a target object pose that can be grasped by high-payload manipulator configurations. Careful selection of the transition states leads to successful transport plans for tasks that are otherwise infeasible. In addition, optimization of the grasp acquisition posture also indirectly improves the transport plan quality, as measured by the safety margin of the manipulator payload limits.",54

icra,None,Topology control of dynamic networks in the presence of local and global constraints,"Nima Moshtagh,Raman Mehra,Mehran Mesbahi,","Formation flying (FF) is a critical element in NASA's future deep-space missions. Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), NASA's first space-based mission to directly observe planets outside our own solar system, will rely on FF to achieve the functionality and benefits of a large instrument using multiple lower cost smaller spacecraft. Many key network design problems for such FF missions can be formulated as optimization problems with local and global constraints. We develop a topology control algorithm that can be used for many network problems in the presence of local constraints, such as collision avoidance, and global constraints, such as network connectivity. The presence of contradictory objectives in topology control problems motivated a game-theoretic approach. We demonstrated that a game-theoretic technique could provide a framework for design and analysis of many topology control problems in dynamic networks. In particular, the problem of motion planning for formation reconfiguration in the presence of constraints on network connectivity and inter-spacecraft collisions is studied.",5

One is referred to as a subgroup module H and the other a complementary or quotient module G/H of H in G. Since QKM can retain both large workspace/rotation range of SKMs and speed/accuracy of PKMs by appropriate choice of modules, it is often implemented in high end machine design for semiconductor die/wire-bonding and 5-axis machining, etc. To promote QKM technology beyond occasional studies and applications, we use differential geometric techniques to develop a rigorous and precise treatment of QKMs, including: (i) modeling and analysis of QKMs; (ii) classification and synthesis of QKMs; (iii) PKM realization of quotient modules.",37

These techniques have been shown to apply broadly to systems ranging from serial, tree, to closed topology systems, as well as to systems with rigid and flexible links/joints. This paper uses concepts from graph theory to obtain a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of spatial operators. We show that spatial kernel operators are instances of block weighted adjacency matrices for the underlying multibody topology graphs, and that spatial propagation operators are 1-resolvents of these matrices. We explore at an abstract level the properties of such 1-resolvents in order to understand the precise requirements on and the range of applicability of spatial operators to the broad class of dynamics problems.",11
icra,None,Information theory on Lie groups and mobile robotics applications,"Gregory S. Chirikjian,","Information Theory is concerned with the reliable transmission of information through noisy environments. This relates to communicating agents, as well as one agent communicating with the environment by taking measurements (e.g., robotic sensing). Typically information theory is formulated in the context of probability on either discrete spaces or continuous Euclidean spaces in which the operation of addition makes sense. Some have extended information theory techniques to differential geometric settings. However, only in the context of group theory can the concept of addition be replaced in a meaningful way with a group operation. This paper presents concepts of information theory on Lie groups developed by the author, and illustrates their application to mobile robotics problems. In particular, the concepts of Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Cramér-Rao bound for pose data are developed, and some theorems about their properties are proved. It is also illustrated how these concepts might be integrated into pose estimation, localization, and odor-plume source detection.",23

The learning strategy we apply is distributed, independent on robot morphology, and easy to implement. First we demonstrate how the strategy allows an ATRON robot to adapt to faults and changes in its morphology and we study the strategy's scalability. Second we extend the strategy to learn the parameters of gait-tables for ATRON and M-TRAN robots. We conclude that the presented strategy is effective for online learning of gaits for most types of modular robots and that learning can effectively be distributed by having independent processes learning in parallel.",20

The entire system is composed of a parent robot, four unassembled modules provided as resources, and an environment where the self-replication takes place. The parent robot grows itself by attaching the resource modules onto itself until it doubles its physical size, and then splits in the middle thereby returning the parent to its original state and producing a daughter robot. We call these processes expansion and separation, respectively. The environment plays a passive role as a catalyst that helps generating a spiral trajectory for the parent robot and does not hold any information about the resource modules. To assess the physical changes made by self-replication, structural and informational complexities associated with the robotic system and the self-replication process are quantified and compared to previous prototypes.",8

Here we present a framework for 2D modular robots made of square modules assembled with arbitrary geometry, which achieve collective and directed locomotion with no centralized controller. Individual modules communicate locally and provably achieve consensus in coordinating movement in a common travel direction. In experiments with simulations and hardware prototypes, we show that robots achieve effective locomotion, irrespective of the number of modules and their connectivity which can be highly asymmetric.",11

Quinn,","This paper is an update on the investigation of Distributed Inward Gripping (DIG) as a rapid and robust attachment mechanism for vertical and inverted climbing. DIG is implemented on an 18-DOF hexapod, DIGbot, with onboard power and control system. Passive compliance in the foot, which is inspired by the flexible tarsus of the cockroach, increases the robustness of the adhesion strategy and enables DIGbot to execute large steps and stationary turns while walking vertically on mesh screen. Results of vertical climbing are shown.",10
icra,None,Internal force compensating method for wall-climbing caterpillar robot,"W. Wang,K. Wang,H. X. Zhang,J. W. Zhang,","The redundant driving problem is an inherent phenomenon existing in a modular caterpillar robot. To limit the internal forces arising from the redundant driving, this paper proposes a joint torque control method, which is based on an assumption that there is only one active joint in the four-link mechanism driving the climbing gait. Except the active joint, the other three joints are all considered as passive joints, whose torques tend to be zero, although they are driven by motors in reality. According to the analyses of static forces in the closed chain state, the ideal torque of named active joint is calculated, and will be followed by the joint in real climbing locomotion. The experiments reveal the reasonability and feasibility of the proposed joint control method, as well as the limitations of current prototype and control algorithm.",9

Nesnas,Sandeep Chinchali,,,","This paper presents the Axel robotic rover which has been designed to provide robust and flexible access to extreme extra-planetary terrains. Axel is a lightweight 2-wheeled vehicle that can access steep slopes and negotiate relatively large obstacles due to its actively managed tether and novel wheel design. This paper reviews the Axel system and focuses on its novel paddle wheel characteristics. We show that the paddle design has superior rock climbing ability. We also adapt basic terramechanics principles to estimate the sinkage of paddle wheels on loose sand. Experimental comparisons between the transport efficiency of mountain bike wheels and paddle wheels are summarized. Finally, we present an unfolding wheel prototype which allows Axel to be compacted for efficient transport.",15

David Remy,Marco Hutter,Luciano Spinello,,","In this paper, we are presenting a method to estimate terrain properties (such as small-scale geometry or surface friction) to improve the assessment of stability and the guiding of foot placement of legged robots in rough terrain. Haptic feedback, expressed through joint motor currents and ground contact force measurements that arises when prescribing a predefined motion was collected for a variety of ground samples (four different shapes and four different surface properties). Features were extracted from this data and used for training and classification by a multiclass AdaBoost machine learning algorithm. In a single leg testbed, the algorithm could correctly classify about 94% of the terrain shapes, and about 73% of the surface samples.",111
icra,None,Probabilistic search with agile UAVs,"Sonia Waharte,Andrew Symington,Niki Trigoni,","Through their ability to rapidly acquire aerial imagery, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to aid target search tasks. Many of the core algorithms which are used to plan search tasks use occupancy grid-based representations and are often based on two main assumptions. Firstly, the altitude of the UAV is constant. Secondly, the onboard sensors can measure the entire state of an entire grid cell. Although these assumptions are sufficient for fixed-wing, high speed UAVs, we do not believe that they are appropriate for small, lightweight, low speed and agile UAVs such as quadrotors. These platforms have the ability to change altitude and their low speed means that multiple measurements may easily overlap multiple cells for substantial periods of time. In this paper we extend a framework for probabilistic search based on decision making to incorporate multiple observations of grid cells and changes in UAV altitude. We account for observation areas that completely and partially cover multiple grid cells. We show the resultant impact on a number of simulation examples.",60

This paper outlines some of the key characteristics of this emergency setting, robot swarms within it and the work conducted to develop effective human-robot interaction.",31
icra,None,Feature selection for gas identification with a mobile robot,"Marco Trincavelli,Amy Loutfi,","In this paper we analyze the problem of discrimination of gases with mobile robots. Previously, it has been shown that the conditions in which data is collected heavily influence the characteristics of the signal to be identified. As a result, the already difficult task of selecting features which characterize a gas is made more challenging by the absence of a steady state response. This is often due to the movement of the robot, and/or the physical properties of the environment, e.g., turbulent airflow creating patches and eddies in the plume. In this work we compare two approaches for feature selection which are able to consider explicitly the information on the experimental setup and optimize the subset of features used in the recognition process. The approaches are tested on a large data set collected with a mobile robot moving in different environments (outdoors and indoors). The results show that the classification performance is improved resulting in a higher average accuracy and lower variance in the accuracy across the different experimental setups.",17
icra,None,The search for survivors: Cooperative human-robot interaction in search and rescue environments using semi-autonomous robots,"Barzin Doroodgar,Maurizio Ficocelli,Babak Mobedi,Goldie Nejat,","Current applications of mobile robots in urban search and rescue (USAR) environments require a human operator in the loop to help guide the robot remotely. Although human operation can be effective, the unknown cluttered nature of the environments make robot navigation and victim identification highly challenging. Operators can become stressed and fatigued very quickly due to a loss of situational awareness, leading to the robots getting stuck and not being able to find victims in the scene during this time-sensitive operation. In addition, current autonomous robots are not capable of traversing these complex unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, a balance between the level of autonomy of the robot and the amount of human control over the robot needs to be addressed. In this paper, we present a unique control architecture for semi-autonomous navigation of a robotic platform utilizing sensory information provided by a novel real-time 3D mapping sensor. The control system provides the robot with the ability to learn and make decisions regarding which rescue tasks should be carried out at a given time and whether an autonomous robot or a human controlled robot can perform these tasks more efficiently without compromising the safety of the victims, rescue workers and the rescue robot. Preliminary experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed collaborative control approach for a USAR robot in an unknown cluttered environment.",74

Disaster City is a training facility for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the United States. FEMA staff used our rescue robot Kenaf to conduct simulated emergency testing. Kenaf is a tele-operated tracked vehicle that has high mobility suitable for use in outside terrains and inside buildings. We equipped Kenaf with a 3-D laser scanner that can measure dense and wide angle 3-D shapes. We collected about 50 3-D mapping data sets during the tests. A part of these data sets can be accessed at our website. In this paper, we explain the Kenaf's tele-operation system, the 3-D mapping system, and the comments about the usability of the 3-D mapping from FEMA staff.

icra,None,Planning and control of an internal point of a deformable object,"Jadav Das,Nilanjan Sarkar,","Manipulative operation of a target point inside a deformable object by a robotic system is necessary in many medical and industrial applications. However, this is a challenging problem because of the difficulty of imposing the motion of the target point by a finite number actuation points located at the boundary of the deformable object. In this paper, an approach towards positioning operation of an internal target point of a deformable object to the desired location by a system of three actuators is presented. First, we design an optimization technique that minimizes the total force applied to the object to determine the location of actuation points to effect the desired motion. Then a position-based PI controller is developed to control the motion of the actuators. A passivity observer and a passivity controller are developed to guarantee the stability of the whole system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",6
icra,None,Integrated Grasp and motion planning,"Nikolaus Vahrenkamp,Martin Do,Tamim Asfour,Rüdiger Dillmann,","In this work, we present an integrated planner for collision-free single and dual arm grasping motions. The proposed Grasp-RRT planner combines the three main tasks needed for grasping an object: finding a feasible grasp, solving the inverse kinematics and searching a collision-free trajectory that brings the hand to the grasping pose. Therefore, RRT-based algorithms are used to build a tree of reachable and collision-free configurations. During RRT-generation, potential grasping positions are generated and approach movements toward them are computed. The quality of reachable grasping poses is scored with an online grasp quality measurement module which is based on the computation of applied forces in order to diminish the net torque.We also present an extension to a dual arm planner which generates bimanual grasps together with corresponding dual arm grasping motions. The algorithms are evaluated with different setups in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.",71
icra,None,Towards One Shot Learning by imitation for humanoid robots,"Yan Wu,Yiannis Demiris,","Teaching a robot to learn new knowledge is a repetitive and tedious process. In order to accelerate the process, we propose a novel template-based approach for robot arm movement imitation. This algorithm selects a previously observed path demonstrated by a human and generates a path in a novel situation based on pairwise mapping of invariant feature locations present in both the demonstrated and the new scenes using a combination of minimum distortion and minimum energy strategies. This One-Shot Learning algorithm is capable of not only mapping simple point-to-point paths but also adapting to more complex tasks such as those involving forced waypoints. As compared to traditional methodologies, our work require neither extensive training for generalisation nor expensive run-time computation for accuracy. This algorithm has been statistically validated using cross-validation of grasping experiments as well as tested for practical implementation on the iCub humanoid robot for playing the tic-tac-toe game.",61
icra,None,Combining planning techniques for manipulation using realtime perception,"Ioan A. Şucan,Mrinal Kalakrishnan,Sachin Chitta,",We present a novel combination of motion planning techniques to compute motion plans for robotic arms. We compute plans that move the arm as close as possible to the goal region using sampling-based planning and then switch to a trajectory optimization technique for the last few centimeters necessary to reach the goal region. This combination allows fast computation and safe execution of motion plans even when the goals are very close to objects in the environment. The system incorporates realtime sensory inputs and correctly deals with occlusions that can occur when robot body parts block the sensor view of the environment. The system is tested on a 7 degree-of-freedom robot arm with sensory input from a tilting laser scanner that provides 3D information about the environment.,39
icra,None,Search-based planning for manipulation with motion primitives,"Benjamin J. Cohen,Sachin Chitta,Maxim Likhachev,","Heuristic searches such as A* search are highly popular means of finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical guarantees on completeness and optimality and simplicity in the implementation. In planning for robotic manipulation however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high-dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based manipulation planner that does deal effectively with the high-dimensionality of the problem. The planner achieves the required efficiency due to the following three factors: (a) its use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics; (b) its use of basic (small) motion primitives as atomic actions; and (c) its use of ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality. Our experimental analysis on a real mobile manipulation platform with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator shows the ability of the planner to solve manipulation in cluttered spaces by generating consistent, low-cost motion trajectories while providing guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality.",140
icra,None,EMG based design and evaluation of Micro Macro Neural Network for rollover support trunk orthosis,"Takeshi Ando,Jun Okamoto,Mitsuru Takahashi,Masakatsu G. Fujie,","An EMG controlled intelligent orthosis was developed to support the rollover movement of cancer bone metastasis patients. In this paper, the validation of the developed signal processing algorithm to recognize the rollover was focused. Firstly, the ElectroMechanicalDelay of the internal oblique muscle was measured as the about 65 (msec). Secondly, it was confirmed that the rollover movement was recognized about 65 (msec) before the movement started. Therefore, the developed Micro Macro Neural Network (MMNN) recognized the rollover movement using the EMG signal as quick as possible. Finally, the robustness of the developed MMNN was discussed by conducting the experiment to discriminate between the rollover and turning out. We proposed and developed the original algorithm in which the logical XOR operation was added to the MMNN, because the MMNN which learned the characteristics of the only rollover recognized the turning out movement as the rollover movement perfectly. When the proposed algorithm that combined the MMNN and XOR operator was used, the rollover and turning out movements were discriminated 83%.",2
icra,None,Estimation of instantaneous tremor parameters for FES-based tremor suppression,"J.A. Gallego,E. Rocon,J.L. Pons,","Pathological tremor constitutes the most common movement disorder, and is increasing its prevalence with ageing. Treatment forms range from drugs to surgery in those patients refractory to drugs, however, tremor is not effectively managed in about 25% of patients. According to this, new management techniques such as wearable robots that take advantage of selective biomechanical loading seem an interesting alternative. Our objective is to design robotic exoskeletons which suppress tremor, letting the user perform a voluntary movement, by means of intelligent control approaches that include accurate tremor models. In this context, we propose a two-stage algorithm for real-time estimation of time varying tremor amplitude and frequency. It is based on the assumption that tremor alters voluntary motion in an additive manner, and happens in a higher frequency band. The two-stage algorithm first generates an estimation of voluntary movement based on its inherent slower dynamics, and then removes it from the total motion, directly providing an estimate of tremor. This tremor estimation is then fed into an adaptive filter, which provides instantaneous tremor characteristics. Accurate and robust tremor amplitude and frequency estimates are obtained.",15

Torrealba,Claudia Pérez-D'Arpino,José Cappelletto,Leonardo Fermín-León,,,","This paper presents the development of a biomechatronic knee prosthesis for transfemoral amputees. This kind of prostheses are considered `intelligent' because they are able to automatically adapt their response at the knee axis, as a natural knee does. This behavior is achieved by characterizing the amputee's gait through the signals captured with instrumentation of a prosthesis, which provides feedback about its current state along the gait cycle and therefore responds with the corresponding control action. In this case, unlike other commercially available intelligent knee prostheses, gait cycle characterization is based on accelerometers signals processed by an events detection algorithm. Two intelligent control strategies are presented: a bio-inspired approach, that consists of using a central pattern generator to generate a knee angle reference to be followed by the prosthesis during walking, and an adaptive scheme, that applies a control action proportional to the knee angle according to an auto-adaptive parameter dependant on gait speed. The mechanical design of the prosthesis is also presented, showing the knee joint mechanism and part of the manufacturing process. Results obtained from walking tests with both able body and amputees are shown, demonstrating the positive performance of the prosthesis in several aspects. Future works aimed at a finished product are also stated.",19
icra,None,A compact rotary series elastic actuator for knee joint assistive system,"Kyoungchul Kong,Joonbum Bae,Masayoshi Tomizuka,","Precise and large torque generation, back-drivability, low output impedance, and compactness of hardware are important requirements for human assistive robots. In this paper, a compact rotary series elastic actuator (cRSEA) is designed considering these requirements. To magnify the torque generated by an electric motor in the limited space of the compact device, a worm gear is utilized. However, the actual torque amplification ratio provided by the worm gear is different from the nominal speed reduction ratio due to friction, which makes the controller design challenging. In this paper, the friction effect is considered in the model of cRSEA, and a robust control algorithm is designed to precisely control the torque output in the presence of nonlinearities such as the friction. The mechanical design and dynamic model of the proposed device and the design of a robust control algorithm are discussed, and actuation performance is verified by experiments.",55

In this work, we contribute an approach for learning precise reaching trajectories for robotic manipulators. We use dimensionality reduction to smooth the example trajectories and transform their representation to a space more amenable to planning. Key to this approach is the careful selection of neighboring points within and between trajectories. This algorithm is capable of creating efficient, collision-free plans even under typical real-world training conditions such as incomplete sensor coverage and lack of an environment model, without imposing additional requirements upon the user such as constraining the types of example trajectories provided. Experimental results are presented to validate this approach.",3
icra,None,Supervised learning of internal models for autonomous goal-oriented robot navigation using Reservoir Computing,"Eric A. Antonelo,Benjamin Schrauwen,","In this work we propose a hierarchical architecture which constructs internal models of a robot environment for goal-oriented navigation by an imitation learning process. The proposed architecture is based on the Reservoir Computing paradigm for training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It is composed of two randomly generated RNNs (called reservoirs), one for modeling the localization capability and one for learning the navigation skill. The localization module is trained to detect the current and previously visited robot rooms based only on 8 noisy infra-red distance sensors. These predictions together with distance sensors and the desired goal location are used by the navigation network to actually steer the robot through the environment in a goal-oriented manner. The training of this architecture is performed in a supervised way (with examples of trajectories created by a supervisor) using linear regression on the reservoir states. So, the reservoir acts as a temporal kernel projecting the inputs to a rich feature space, whose states are linearly combined to generate the desired outputs. Experimental results on a simulated robot show that the trained system can localize itself within both simple and large unknown environments and navigate successfully to desired goals.",27
icra,None,A HMM-based approach to learning probability models of programming strategies for industrial robots,"Rebecca Hollmann,Arne Rost,Martin Hägele,Alexander Verl,","The integration of industrial robot systems into the manufacturing environments of small and medium sized enterprises is a key requirement to guarantee competitiveness and productivity. Due to the still complex and time-consuming procedure of robot path definition, novel programming strategies are needed, converting the robotic system into a flexible coworker that actively supports its operator. In this paper, a learning-from-demonstration strategy based on Hidden Markov Models is presented, which permits the robot system to adapt to user- as well as process-specific features. To evaluate the suitability of this approach for small-lot production, the learning strategy has been implemented for an arc welding robot and has been evaluated on-site at a medium sized metal-working company.",8
icra,None,Apprenticeship learning via soft local homomorphisms,"Abdeslam Boularias,Brahim Chaib-draa,","We consider the problem of apprenticeship learning when the expert's demonstration covers only a small part of a large state space. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) provides an efficient solution to this problem based on the assumption that the expert is optimally acting in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, past work on IRL requires an accurate estimate of the frequency of encountering each feature of the states when the robot follows the expert's policy. Given that the complete policy of the expert is unknown, the features frequencies can only be empirically estimated from the demonstrated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to use a transfer method, known as soft homomorphism, in order to generalize the expert's policy to unvisited regions of the state space. The generalized policy can be used either as the robot's final policy, or to calculate the features frequencies within an IRL algorithm. Empirical results show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.",5
icra,None,A game-theoretic procedure for learning hierarchically structured strategies,"Benjamin Rosman,Subramanian Ramamoorthy,","This paper addresses the problem of acquiring a hierarchically structured robotic skill in a nonstationary environment. This is achieved through a combination of learning primitive strategies from observation of an expert, and autonomously synthesising composite strategies from that basis. Both aspects of this problem are approached from a game theoretic viewpoint, building on prior work in the area of multiplicative weights learning algorithms. The utility of this procedure is demonstrated through simulation experiments motivated by the problem of autonomous driving. We show that this procedure allows the agent to come to terms with two forms of uncertainty in the world - continually varying goals (due to oncoming traffic) and nonstationarity of optimisation criteria (e.g., driven by changing navigability of the road). We argue that this type of factored task specification and learning is a necessary ingredient for robust autonomous behaviour in a “large-world” setting.",5
icra,None,Design of navigation behaviors and the selection framework with Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets toward dependable navigation of a mobile robot,"Chang-bae Moon,Woojin Chung,","There have been two major streams for the motion control of mobile robots. The first is the model-based deliberate control and the second is the sensor-based reactive control. Since two schemes have complementary advantages and disadvantages, one cannot completely replace the other. There are a variety of environmental conditions which affect the navigation performances. The main idea of this paper is to design discrete navigation behaviors and to integrate behaviors by an appropriate selection framework. In this paper, we propose a behavior selection framework using the GSPN (Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets). We have designed two navigation behaviors which show completely different performances. In order to define behavior selection criteria, two kinds of navigation statuses are defined to monitor navigation performances of the robot. The proposed navigation strategy is simulated using the open source simulator Player/Stage to investigate the performances in a variety of conditions. Through the simulations, it was made clear that different behaviors show remarkably different performances. Moreover, the average navigation time of the proposed behavior selection framework is significantly decreased than that of any single navigation scheme DWA or tracking.",6
icra,None,An AUVs path planner using genetic algorithms with a deterministic crossover operator,"Chi-Tsun Cheng,Kia Fallahi,Henry Leung,Chi K. Tse,","Path planning is an optimization process in which a path between two points is to be found that results in a user-defined optimum satisfaction of a given set of requirements. For small scale path planning, exact algorithms such as linear programming and dynamic programming are usually adopted which are able to give optimum solutions in short time. However, due to their memory intensive nature and computational complexity, exact algorithms are not applicable for medium to large scale path planning. Meta-heuristic algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms can provide sub-optimum solution without the full understanding of the search space and are widely used in large-scaled path planning. However, extra precautions are needed to avoid meta-heuristic algorithms from being trapped in local optimum points. In this paper, a path planner combining genetic algorithms (GA) with dynamic programming (DP) is proposed to solve an autonomous under-water vehicles (AUVs) path planning problem. The proposed path planner inherits the speed of exact algorithms and the scalable nature of meta-heuristic algorithms. Simulation results show that when comparing with conventional GA-based path planners, the proposed path planner can greatly improve the convergence rate and solution quality.",21

The objective is to achieve and maintain desired formation tracking, and guarantee no collision between the marine vehicles. The control development relies on existing potential functions which fall at a minimum value when the vehicles reach the desired formation, and blow up to infinity when the vehicles approach collision. The combination of the potential functions, backstepping and variable structure based design technique allows us to handle time varying disturbances by ensuring a stable formation. Using the sliding-Backstepping technique and Lyapunov synthesis, a stable coordination tracking controller is designed. Uniform boundedness of the closed loop signals system is achieved.",9

The environment is modelled using linear segments that represent boundaries between the estimated traversable and non-traversable regions. The approach integrates Receding Horizon Control (RHC) and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM).

Distributed nonlinear estimation, however is still a relatively unexplored field despite the need in numerous practical situations for techniques that can handle nonlinearities. This paper presents a unified way of describing distributed implementations of three commonly used nonlinear estimators: the Extended Kalman Filter, the Unscented Kalman Filter and the Particle Filter. Leveraging on the presented framework, we propose new distributed versions of these methods, in which the nonlinearities are locally managed by the various sensors whereas the different estimates are merged based on a weighted average consensus process. The proposed versions are shown to outperform the few published ones in two robot localization test cases.",54
icra,None,Dynamic consensus for merging visual maps under limited communications,"R. Aragues,J. Cortes,C. Sagues,","In this paper we present an algorithm for merging visual maps in a robot network. Along the operation, each robot observes the environment and builds and maintains its local map. Simultaneously, the robots communicate and build a global map of the environment. The communication between the robots is limited, and, at every time instant, each robot can only exchange data with its neighboring robots. We provide a distributed solution to the problem which does not rely on any particular communication topology and is robust to changes in the topology. Each robot computes and tracks the global map based on local interactions with its neighbors. Our contribution is the extension of distributed sensor fusion ideas to the problem of dynamic map merging. Under mild connectivity conditions on the communication graph, this algorithm asymptotically converges to the global map. The real experiments have been carried out with visual information, which is of special interest in robotics.",19
icra,None,Detecting anomalies in unmanned vehicles using the Mahalanobis distance,"Raz Lin,Eliyahu Khalastchi,Gal A. Kaminka,","The use of unmanned autonomous vehicles is becoming more and more significant in recent years. The fact that the vehicles are unmanned (whether autonomous or not), can lead to greater difficulties in identifying failure and anomalous states, since the operator cannot rely on its own body perceptions to identify failures. Moreover, as the autonomy of unmanned vehicles increases, it becomes more difficult for operators to monitor them closely, and this further exacerbates the difficulty of identifying anomalous states, in a timely manner. Model-based diagnosis and fault-detection systems have been proposed to recognize failures. However, these rely on the capabilities of the underlying model, which necessarily abstracts away from the physical reality of the robot. In this paper we propose a novel, model-free, approach for detecting anomalies in unmanned autonomous vehicles, based on their sensor readings (internal and external). Experiments conducted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) demonstrate the efficacy of the approach by detecting the vehicles deviations from nominal behavior.",56
icra,None,Multi-robot pursuit-evasion without maps,"Andreas Kolling,Stefano Carpin,","We propose a distributed algorithm enabling a large team of robots to detect all intruders within a large planar environment. Each robot can only detect intruders and communicate with other robots within a limited range. No map of the environment is given, and none is built during the process. Robots are only capable of following walls and other robots that are nearby. The algorithm puts together elementary behaviors giving robots the means to coordinate their movement in order to cover lines between opposite walls with their sensors and discover nearby new walls. A line has leading robots at its endpoints that follow walls and hence move the line of robots forward. Multiple such lines move through the entire assigned area in order to detect all intruders. The movement of multiple lines is coordinated by using a graph representation of the environment that describes possible line movements and their associated costs in terms of robots. This coordination requires only local communication between the leaders of different robot lines when they meet. Finally, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be implemented using elementary wall following and obstacle discovery behaviors.",45

icra,None,B-spline based filters for multi-point trajectories planning,"Luigi Biagiotti,Claudio Melchiorri,","In this paper, the relation between B-splines and FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters is demonstrated and exploited to design a digital filter for trajectory planning, combining the very simple structure and computational efficiency of FIR filters with the flexibility of splines. In particular, the trajectory generator consists of two main elements. The former is devoted to the solution of an optimization problem that, given a set of points to be interpolated (or approximated), provides the control points defining the spline. The latter, a cascade of moving average filters, gives the trajectory profile at each sampling time on the basis of such points. The proposed method has been applied to several robotic and industrial applications, and in this paper two case studies are reported as examples: an industrial robot performing a welding operation and a mobile robot moving in an environment with obstacles. With respect to these tasks, the main features of the trajectory generator are shown: the possibility of planning trajectories with high degree of smoothness (continuity of the derivatives), the possibility of easily changing the duration of the trajectory (and therefore the velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc. of the trajectory) maintaining the same geometric path, the possibility of locally modifying the pre-planned path.",34
icra,None,On the design of deformable input- / state-lattice graphs,"Martin Rufli,Roland Siegwart,","In this paper we describe a novel and simple to implement yet effective lattice design algorithm, which simultaneously produces input and state-space sampled lattice graphs. The presented method is an extension to the ideas suggested by Bicchi et al. on input lattices and is applicable to systems which can be brought into (2,n) chained form, such as kinematic models of unicycles, bicycles, differential-drive robots and car-like vehicles (pulling several trailers). We further show that a transformation from chained form to path coordinates allows the resulting lattice to be bent along any C 1 continuous path. We exploit this fact by shaping it along the skeleton of arbitrary structured environments, such as the center of road lanes and corridors. In our experiments in both structured (i.e. on-road) and unstructured (i.e. parking lot) scenarios, we successfully demonstrate for the first time the applicability of lattice-based planning approaches to search queries in arbitrary environments.",43

We propose a distributed sampling based planning framework (Distributed PRM), where every sensor node creates a local roadmap in its locally-sensed environment; these local roadmaps are “stitched” together by passing messages among nodes and form a larger implicit roadmap without having a global representation. Based on the implicit roadmap, a feasible path is computed in a distributed manner, and the robot moves along the path by interacting with sensor nodes, each of which gives a portion of the path within the local environment of the node. Preliminary simulations show the proposed framework is able to solve path planning problem with low communication overhead.",49
icra,None,DAvinCi: A cloud computing framework for service robots,"Rajesh Arumugam,Vikas Reddy Enti,Liu Bingbing,Wu Xiaojun,Krishnamoorthy Baskaran,,,,,","We propose DAvinCi, a software framework that provides the scalability and parallelism advantages of cloud computing for service robots in large environments. We have implemented such a system around the Hadoop cluster with ROS (Robotic Operating system) as the messaging framework for our robotic ecosystem. We explore the possibilities of parallelizing some of the robotics algorithms as Map/Reduce tasks in Hadoop. We implemented the FastSLAM algorithm in Map/Reduce and show how significant performance gains in execution times to build a map of a large area can be achieved with even a very small eight-node Hadoop cluster. The global map can later be shared with other robots introduced in the environment via a Software as a Service (SaaS) Model. This reduces the burden of exploration and map building for the new robot and minimizes it's need for additional sensors. Our primary goal is to develop a cloud computing environment which provides a compute cluster built with commodity hardware exposing a suite of robotic algorithms as a SaaS and share data co-operatively across the robotic ecosystem.",432
icra,None,An RRT-based path planner for use in trajectory imitation,"Jonathan Claassens,",We propose a more robust robot programming by demonstration system planner that produces a reproduction path which satisfies statistical constraints derived from demonstration trajectories and avoids obstacles given the freedom in those constraints. To determine the statistical constraints a Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted to demonstration trajectories. These demonstrations are recorded through kinesthetic teaching of a redundant manipulator. The GMM models the likelihood of configurations given time. The planner is based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree search with the search tree kept within the statistical model. Collision avoidance is included by not allowing the tree to grow into obstacles. The system is designed to act as a backup for a faster reactive planner that may fall into a local minimum. To illustrate its performance an experiment is conducted where the system is taught to open a Pelican case using a Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM). During reproduction an obstacle is placed nearby the case to partially obstruct the manipulator. The planner successfully avoided this obstacle without drifting from the trend in the demonstrations.,16
icra,None,"Scalable real-time object recognition and segmentation via cascaded, discriminative Markov random fields","Paul Vernaza,Daniel D. Lee,","We present a method for real-time simultaneous object recognition and segmentation based on cascaded discriminative Markov random fields. A Markov random field models coupling between the labels of adjacent image regions. The MRF affinities are learned as linear functions of image features in a structured max-margin framework that admits a solution via convex optimization. In contrast to other known MRF/CRF-based approaches, our method classifies in real-time and has computational complexity that scales only logarithmically in the number of object classes. We accomplish this by applying a cascade of binary MRF-classifiers in a way similar to error-correcting output coding for general multiclass learning problems. Inference in this model is exact and can be performed very efficiently using graph cuts. Experimental results are shown that demonstrate a marked improvement in classification accuracy over purely local methods.",3
icra,None,Real-time identification and localization of body parts from depth images,"Christian Plagemann,Varun Ganapathi,Daphne Koller,Sebastian Thrun,","We deal with the problem of detecting and identifying body parts in depth images at video frame rates. Our solution involves a novel interest point detector for mesh and range data that is particularly well suited for analyzing human shape. The interest points, which are based on identifying geodesic extrema on the surface mesh, coincide with salient points of the body, which can be classified as, e.g., hand, foot or head using local shape descriptors. Our approach also provides a natural way of estimating a 3D orientation vector for a given interest point. This can be used to normalize the local shape descriptors to simplify the classification problem as well as to directly estimate the orientation of body parts in space. Experiments involving ground truth labels acquired via an active motion capture system show that our interest points in conjunction with a boosted patch classifier are significantly better in detecting body parts in depth images than state-of-the-art sliding-window based detectors.",398

icra,None,Using stereo for object recognition,"Scott Helmer,David Lowe,","There has been significant progress recently in object recognition research, but many of the current approaches still fail for object classes with few distinctive features, and in settings with significant clutter and viewpoint variance. One such setting is visual search in mobile robotics, where tasks such as finding a mug or stapler require robust recognition. The focus of this paper is on integrating stereo vision with appearance based recognition to increase accuracy and efficiency. We propose a model that utilizes a chamfer-type silhouette classifier which is weighted by a prior on scale, which is robust to missing stereo depth information. Our approach is validated on a set of challenging indoor scenes containing mugs and shoes, where we find that priors remove a significant number of false positives, improving the average precision by 0.2 on each dataset.

This method can be applied to partial models with any size in any posture. Although it is becoming easy to obtain textured 3D models by a 3D scanner, there are few methods for 3D object recognition which take into account both shape and textures of objects. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve high-speed processing of large 3D data. Our 3D features consider the co-occurrence of shape and colors of an object's surface. The additive property of these features makes it possible to calculate the similarity between a query part and the subspace of each object in a database without division, and therefore the time for recognition is quite short. In the experiments, we compare our method with conventional methods using Spin-Images and Textured Spin-Images. We show that our method is appropriate for 3D object recognition.",28

We call such microstructures with bacteria Micro Bio Robots (MBRs) and the uncontrolled motion in the absence of stimuli self actuation. Our paper has two primary contributions. First, we demonstrate the control of MBRs using self-actuation, DC electric fields and ultra-violet radiation, and develop experimentally validated mathematical model for the MBRs. This model allows us to use self-actuation and electrokinetic actuation to steer the MBR to any position and orientation in a planar micro channel. Second, we describe the development of biosensors for the MBRs.

Subsequently, these parameters are used to design two model-based PID controllers that allow the FELA to perform high-precision positioning tasks and direct-force imprinting tasks respectively. As the imprinting tasks require the FELA to operate in both position and direct-force control modes, two types of control strategies are explored and their competency of enabling the FELA to perform such tasks are investigated. Lastly, the selected control strategy is implemented on the FELA to assist the hot-embossing imprinter in fabricating micro-channels on polymer substrates via a hot-embossing process.",8

We show how a direct implementation of the EKF algorithm leads to inconsistency in the estimated localization. We justify the origin of the anomalous behaviour of the filter in the time-correlated nature of the measurement noise sequence. A novel solution based on the measurement differencing technique is proposed to drive the solution of the EKF towards consistency.

Recent pose graph representations have proven very successful for single robot mapping and localization. Among these methods, incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) gives an exact incremental solution to the SLAM problem by solving a full nonlinear optimization problem in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel extension to iSAM to facilitate online multi-robot mapping based on multiple pose graphs. Our main contribution is a relative formulation of the relationship between multiple pose graphs that avoids the initialization problem and leads to an efficient solution when compared to a completely global formulation. The relative pose graphs are optimized together to provide a globally consistent multi-robot solution. Efficient access to covariances at any time for relative parameters is provided through iSAM, facilitating data association and loop closing. The performance of the technique is illustrated on various data sets including a publicly available multi-robot data set.

A necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the solution is presented, which requires O(n 2 = log n) to be verified and is based on the notion of rotational symmetry in R 2 . We also derive the relationship between the number of robots and the number of possible solutions, and classify the solutions in a number of equivalence classes which is linear in n.

We formulate this as a weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimation problem, and determine the exact global optimum by directly solving the multivariate polynomial system resulting from the first-order optimality conditions. Given the poor scalability of the original WLS problem, we propose an alternative formulation of the WLS problem in terms of squared distance measurements (squared distances WLS or SD-WLS). Using a hybrid algebraic-numeric technique, we are able to solve the corresponding first-order optimality conditions of the SD-WLS in 125 ms in Matlab. Both methods solve the minimal (3 distance measurements) as well as the overdetermined problem (more than 3 measurements) in a unified fashion. Simulation and experimental results show that the SD-WLS achieves performance virtually indistinguishable from the maximum likelihood estimator, and significantly outperforms current algebraic methods.",27

icra,None,High quality goal connection for nonholonomic obstacle navigation allowing for drift using dynamic potential fields,"Michael K. Weir,Matthew P. Bott,",The problem we address in this paper is how to plan and execute high quality paths for robots subject to nonholonomic constraints while navigating obstacles in 2D space. The navigation is to be carried out continuously at speed and may be subject to drift that is not predictable a priori. The problem raises the challenge of adaptively maintaining a smooth robust path of low computational cost. The algorithm is complete in providing feasible paths connecting to the goal in cluttered environments without global maps or positioning while also optimising the path curvature in free space. The approach is a generic gradient-based methodology set in dynamic potential fields that are not subject to fixed local minima or other misdirecting surface features of static fields. Multiple planning and execution cycles are interleaved to allow frequent updates for dealing with unanticipated obstacles and drift. We present our methodology and demonstrate experimental results for simulated robots. The results show that low curvature paths are found that robustly connect to the goal under perturbation through a sequence of fast adaptive replanning.,5

No constraints on the motion of the object nor the robot itself are assumed, which is an improvement on previous methods.

icra,None,Balancing state-space coverage in planning with dynamics,"Yanbo Li,Kostas E. Bekris,","Sampling-based kinodynamic planners, such as the popular RRT algorithm, have been proposed as promising solutions to planning for systems with dynamics. Nevertheless, complex systems often raise significant challenges. In particular, the state-space exploration of sampling-based tree planners can be heavily biased towards a specific direction due to the presence of dynamics and underactuation. The premise of this paper is that it is possible to use statistical tools to learn quickly the effects of the constraints in the algorithm's state-space exploration during a training session. Then during the online operation of the algorithm, this information can be utilized so as to counter the undesirable bias due to the dynamics by appropriately adapting the control propagation step. The resulting method achieves a more balanced exploration of the state-space, resulting in faster solutions to planning challenges. The paper provides proof of concept experiments comparing against and improving upon the standard RRT using MATLAB simulations for (a) swinging up different versions of a 3-link Acrobot system with dynamics and (b) a second-order car-like system with significant drift.",18

In comparison with conventional geared motors, actuators with variable stiffness introduce the need for new specifications, requirements, and performance criteria, concerning e.g. the range of achievable stiffness, and the response time to stiffness reference changes. On the other hand, the mechanical construction of VSAs is also more complex. To address the problem of harnessing the increased complexity of VSA design, we consider in this article the enumeration of all possible arrangements of two prime movers (elementary motors), two harmonic-drive gears, the output shaft, and the interconnections (either rigid or elastic) between these elements. We propose an automated algorithm to search the large combinatorics of such enumeration, and present a reduced number of feasible basic designs which accomplish the objectives of VS actuation.

The synchronization not only follows the simplified joint angle dynamics of human running but also generates the uniform running speed from wide range of initial speed, which claims that the controller is robust for the error of initial speed. Moreover, it successfully verifies the acceleration of running speed from 0.1[m/s], which is almost zero speed, to a uniform running speed “without” switching controllers. Finally, the controller is applied for the running on an uneven terrain, and it successfully achieves running with the maximum slope angle 6[deg], which is highly steep terrain in the real situation.",6

A serious threat to safety is the fall of a humanoid robot, which can seriously damage both the robot and objects in its surrounding. This paper proposes a strategy for planning and control of fall. The controller's objective is to prevent the robot from hitting surrounding objects during a fall by modifying its default fall direction. We have earlier presented such a direction-changing fall controller in. However, the controller was applicable only when the robot's surrounding contained a single object. In this paper we introduce a generalized approach to humanoid fall-direction control among multiple objects. This new framework algorithmically establishes a desired fall direction through assigned scores, considers a number of control options, and selects and executes the best strategy. The fall planner is also able to select “No Action” as the best strategy, if appropriate. The controller is interactive and is applicable for fall occurring during upright standing or walking. The fall performance is continuously tracked and can be improved in real-time. The planning and control algorithms are demonstrated in simulation on an ASIMO-like humanoid robot.",23

The framework comprises two components: 1) Generalized Inverse Dynamics (GID) that determines joint forces satisfying multiple objectives considering task priorities and various constraints and 2) the Idealized Joint Unit (IJU) that generates accurate torque with assigned apparent inertia and viscosity. GID treats the robot as a single manipulator with multiple branches using a joint model with 2-DOF motion subspace equivalent to two opposing wheels. A 21-DOF mobile robot equipped with IJUs is set up and GID is applied to it. The result shows that GID works well in the examples of physical human-robot interaction and object manipulation where motion objectives are attained coordinating the whole body while keeping passivity due to the redundancy and the assigned impedance property.",36
icra,None,The bielefeld anthropomorphic robot head “Flobi”,"Ingo Lütkebohle,Frank Hegel,Simon Schulz,Matthias Hackel,Britta Wrede,,,","A robot's head is important both for directional sensors and, in human-directed robotics, as the single most visible interaction interface. However, designing a robot's head faces contradicting requirements when integrating powerful sensing with social expression. Furher, reactions of the general public show that current head designs often cause negative user reactions and distract from the functional capabilities. Therefore, this contribution presents a novel anthropomorphic robot head called ""Flobi"", which combines state-of-the-art sensing functionality with an exterior that elicits a sympathetic emotional response. It can display primary and secondary emotions in a human-like way, to enable intuitive human-robot-interaction. To facilitate further research on facial appearance, the exterior is fully modular and replaceable. While current state-of-the-art still requires trade-offs when integrating sensing and social expression, Flobi has been designed to enable service robotic applications, with high-resolution, wide-angle stereo vision, gyroscope motion compensation and stereo audio. For ease of integration, the head is self-contained, including 18 actuators, sensors and control boards, all in a human-head sized package.",142

Flynn,Rouhollah Jafari,Ranjan Mukherjee,","We present the design and control of a simple three-link underactuated synthetic wheel biped composed of a torso and two legs with arc-shaped feet. The equations of motion are derived and a controller based on feedback linearization is used to constrain the controllable degrees of freedom and develop a simple gait. Experimental results show successful gait generation and relatively good trajectory tracking. The data on energy consumption indicates a reasonably low cost of transport, even without design or trajectory optimization.",3
icra,None,Whole-body humanoid control from upper-body task specifications,"Ghassan Bin Hammam,David E. Orin,Behzad Dariush,","This paper introduces a very efficient, modified resolved acceleration control algorithm for dynamic filtering and control of whole-body humanoid motion in response to upper-body task specifications. The dynamic filter is applicable for general upper-body motions when standing in place. It is characterized by modification of the commanded torso acceleration based on a geometric solution to produce a ZMP which is inside the support. The resulting feasible modified motion is synchronized to the reference motion when the computed ZMP for the reference motion again falls within the support. Contact forces at each foot are controlled through a dedicated force distribution module which optimizes the ankle roll and pitch torques. The proposed approach uses time-local information and is therefore targeted for online control. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by means of simulated experiments on a model of the Honda humanoid robot ASIMO using a highly dynamic upper-body reference motion.",16
icra,None,Inverse dynamics control of floating base systems using orthogonal decomposition,"Michael Mistry,Jonas Buchli,Stefan Schaal,","Model-based control methods can be used to enable fast, dexterous, and compliant motion of robots without sacrificing control accuracy. However, implementing such techniques on floating base robots, e.g., humanoids and legged systems, is non-trivial due to under-actuation, dynamically changing constraints from the environment, and potentially closed loop kinematics. In this paper, we show how to compute the analytically correct inverse dynamics torques for model-based control of sufficiently constrained floating base rigid-body systems, such as humanoid robots with one or two feet in contact with the environment. While our previous inverse dynamics approach relied on an estimation of contact forces to compute an approximate inverse dynamics solution, here we present an analytically correct solution by using an orthogonal decomposition to project the robot dynamics onto a reduced dimensional space, independent of contact forces. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our approach on a simulated floating base bipedal humanoid robot and an actual robot dog locomoting over rough terrain.",266
icra,None,3-DOF Cartesian Force Limiting Device Based on the Delta architecture for safe physical human-robot interaction,"Nicolas Lauzier,Clément Gosselin,","This paper presents a device that significantly improves the safety of ceiling-mounted robots whose end effector orientation remains constant with respect to the vertical direction (e.g. Scara-type robots). The device consists of a three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism with the Delta architecture on which the revolute actuators have been replaced with torque limiters. The resulting Cartesian force limiting device (CFLD) is implemented as a mechanical connection between the robot and the effector. It is rigid unless excessive forces are applied on the end effector, for example during a collision. The magnitude of force that activates the mechanism is set by properly adjusting the threshold of the torque limiters. Furthermore, a collision can be rapidly detected with a limit switch placed on one of the links of the mechanism and a signal can be sent directly to brakes that will stop the robot, without passing through a controller and thus improving the reliability and reaction-time of the safety system. By mechanically disconnecting the robot from its end effector, the device ensures that the person involved in the collision is only subjected to the inertia of the end effector and thus potential injuries are greatly reduced. This work is the extension of a previous 2-DOF CFLD that was sensitive only to horizontal forces. The new architecture reacts to collisions occuring in any direction and is geometrically optimized for the proposed application. Also, means to achieve gravitity compensation are proposed.",20

In this context, the influence of robot mass and velocity during rigid impacts with and without the possibility of the human being clamped was quantified. In this paper an analysis of soft-tissue injuries caused by sharp tools, which are mounted on/grasped by a robot is carried out as the next step down the road to a full safety analysis of robots for HRI. We conducted an analysis of soft-tissue injuries based on available biomechanical and forensic data and to our knowledge for the first time in robotics present various experimental results with biological tissue for validation.

This is followed by the introduction of a new prediction-based reactive control strategy. The new control strategy considers foreseeable dangerous events by predicting human motion using artificial neural networks, based on the previous pattern of the motion. This approach enables a robot to foresee an upcoming danger in order to take preventive actions before the danger is immanent.

However, most of today's mobile robots use non-backdrivable motors for locomotion, making them potentially dangerous in case of collision. This paper presents a robot, named AZIMUT-3, equipped with differential elastic actuators that are backdrivable and torque controlled, capable of being force-guided. Real world results demonstrate that AZIMUT-3 can move efficiently in response to physical commands given by a human pushing the robot in the intended direction.",18
icra,None,Ankle and hip balance control strategies with transitions,"Yoshikazu Kanamiya,Shun Ota,Daisuke Sato,","A method for implementing the ankle and hip balance control strategies, well known from studies on human balance control, is suggested. The moment of the acting disturbance force is evaluated continuously in real time via the difference between the ZMP and the ground projection of the center of mass. Compliant response to the continuous disturbance is ensured by attaching a virtual spring-damper in an appropriate way for each strategy. Further on, whenever the limit of the ankle strategy is reached, a smooth transition toward the hip strategy is initialized and compliance is ensured in a continuous way and in agreement with the disturbance. After the disturbance is removed, the humanoid switches first back to the ankle strategy, and then returns to the initial equilibrium (erect) posture. Experimental data taken with a small humanoid robot (HOAP-2) are presented to validate the method. See also the accompanying video clip.",45
icra,None,Generating individual maps from Universal map for heterogeneous mobile robots,"Kentaro Takemura,Ato Araki,Junichi Ido,Yoshio Matsumoto,Jun Takamatsu,,","In this research, a Universal map, which can be converted to individual maps for heterogeneous mobile robots, is proposed. A Universal map can be generated using our developed measurement robot, and it is composed of a textured 3D environment model. Therefore, every robot can use a Universal map as a common map, and it is utilized for various localization technologies such as view-based and LRF-based methods. In LRF-based localization, accurate localization is achieved using a specific map, which is generated from Universal map. In a view-based approach, localization and navigation are achieved using rendered images. The use of a Universal map enables generation of these maps automatically. The effectiveness of this approach is confirmed through experiments.",5

The algebraic least-squares fit usually considered in the literature is biased, although it is fast to compute. We extend our previous work in planar patch extraction using a detailed sensor noise model to the extraction of quadrics. First, the fast least-squares method is modified to detect degeneracy automatically and it is used to aid segmentation. The final segmented quadric patch is then refined using a numerical maximum likelihood approach which employs the sensor range error model. Experimental results for artificial data and two different 3D sensors are provided to show the feasibility of our approach.",5
icra,None,Using recursive spectral registrations to determine brokenness as measure of structural map errors,"Andreas Birk,","There are many common error sources that influence mapping, e.g., salt and pepper noise as well as other effects occurring quite uniformly distributed over the map. On the other hand, there are also errors, which occur very rarely but with severe effects. These errors influence not only the local accuracy but the overall spatial layout of the map. Concrete examples include bump noise in the robot's pose or residual errors in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Brokenness is presented here to capture one form of structural errors in grid maps. Concretely, brokenness measures the degree with which a map can be partitioned into regions that are locally consistent with ground truth but “off” relative to each other. The concept of brokenness is presented in a formal way and it is shown how it can be computed in an efficient way using recursive spectral registrations. Experimental results show that the metric can indeed be used to automatically determine one structural quality aspect of a map in a quantitative way.",2
icra,None,Contextual occupancy maps incorporating sensor and location uncertainty,"Simon T. O'Callaghan,Fabio T. Ramos,Hugh Durrant-Whyte,","This paper describes a method of incorporating sensor and localisation uncertainty into contextual occupancy maps to provide for robust mapping. This paper builds on a recently proposed application of the Gaussian process (GP) to occupancy mapping. An extension of GPs is employed which incorporates uncertain inputs into the covariance function. In turn, this allows statistically consistent, multi-resolution maps to be constructed which exploit the spatial inference properties of GPs while correctly accounting for sensor and localisation errors. Experiments are described, with both synthetic and real data, which show the benefits of complete uncertainty modeling and how contextual occupancy maps may be constructed by fusing data from different sensors on different robots in a common probabilistic representation.",18
icra,None,Automatic reconstruction of textured 3D models,"Benjamin Pitzer,Sören Kammel,Charles DuHadway,Jan Becker,","This paper describes a system for automatic mapping and generation of textured 3D models of indoor environments without user interaction. Our data acquisition system is based on a Segway RMP platform which allows us to automatically acquire large amounts of textured 3D scans in a short amount of time. The first data processing step is registration and mapping. We propose a probabilistic, non-rigid registration method that incorporates statistical sensor models and surface prior distributions to optimize alignment and the reconstructed surface at the same time. Second, in order to fuse multiple scans and to reconstruct a consistent 3D surface representation, we incorporate a volumetric surface reconstruction method based on a oriented point. For the final step of texture reconstruction, we present a novel method to automatically generate blended textures from multiple images and multiple scans which are mapped onto the 3D model for photo-realistic visualization. We conclude our report with results from a large-scale, real-world experiment. The most significant contribution of this research is a functional system that covers all steps required to automatically reconstruct textured 3D models of large indoor environments.",25
icra,None,Visual odometry priors for robust EKF-SLAM,"Pablo F. Alcantarilla,Luis M. Bergasa,Frank Dellaert,","One of the main drawbacks of standard visual EKF-SLAM techniques is the assumption of a general camera motion model. Usually this motion model has been implemented in the literature as a constant linear and angular velocity model. Because of this, most approaches cannot deal with sudden camera movements, causing them to lose accurate camera pose and leading to a corrupted 3D scene map. In this work we propose increasing the robustness of EKF-SLAM techniques by replacing this general motion model with a visual odometry prior, which provides a real-time relative pose prior by tracking many hundreds of features from frame to frame. We perform fast pose estimation using the two-stage RANSAC-based approach from [1]: a two-point algorithm for rotation followed by a one-point algorithm for translation. Then we integrate the estimated relative pose into the prediction step of the EKF. In the measurement update step, we only incorporate a much smaller number of landmarks into the 3D map to maintain real-time operation. Incorporating the visual odometry prior in the EKF process yields better and more robust localization and mapping results when compared to the constant linear and angular velocity model case. Our experimental results, using a handheld stereo camera as the only sensor, clearly show the benefits of our method against the standard constant velocity model.",57
icra,None,FAB-MAP + RatSLAM: Appearance-based SLAM for multiple times of day,"Arren J. Glover,William P. Maddern,Michael J. Milford,Gordon F. Wyeth,","Appearance-based mapping and localisation is especially challenging when separate processes of mapping and localisation occur at different times of day. The problem is exacerbated in the outdoors where continuous change in sun angle can drastically affect the appearance of a scene. We confront this challenge by fusing the probabilistic local feature based data association method of FAB-MAP with the pose cell filtering and experience mapping of RatSLAM. We evaluate the effectiveness of our amalgamation of methods using five datasets captured throughout the day from a single camera driven through a network of suburban streets. We show further results when the streets are re-visited three weeks later, and draw conclusions on the value of the system for lifelong mapping.",241
icra,None,Consistency of the monocular EKF-SLAM algorithm for three different landmark parametrizations,"Joan Solà,","We benchmark in this article three different landmark parametrizations in monocular 6DOF EKF-SLAM. These parametrizations are homogeneous points (HP), inverse-distance points (IDP, better known as inverse-depth), and the new anchored homogeneous points (AHP). The discourse used for describing them is chosen to highlight their differences and similarities, showing that they are just incremental variations of ones with respect to the others. We show for the first time a complete comparison of HP against IDP, two methods that are getting popular, and introduce also for the first time AHP, whose description falls precisely between the other two. The benchmarking is done by running all algorithms on the same data and by using the well-established NEES consistency analysis. Our conclusion is that the new AHP parametrization is the most interesting one for monocular EKF-SLAM (followed by IDP and then HP) because it greatly postpones the apparition of EKF inconsistency.",64

We report the results of validating our methodology using a mobile robot equipped with a 2D laser range finder and an omnidirectional camera.",27
icra,None,Optimization techniques for laser-based 3D particle filter SLAM,"Jochen Welle,Dirk Schulz,Thomas Bachran,Armin B. Cremers,","In recent years multiple simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been proposed, which address the challenges of 3D environments in combination with six degress of freedom in the robot position. Commonly, solutions based on scan-matching algorithms are applied. In contrast to these approaches, we propose to use a particle filter transferring the concept of the 2D Rao-Blackwellized particle filter SLAM to 3D. As filter input, 3D laser range data and odometry readings are obtained while the robot is in motion. The ground plane is estimated based on previously built map parts, thereby approaching the problem that not all degrees of freedom are covered by the odometry. To gain control of the high memory requirements for the particles' 3D map representations, we introduce a memory efficient search structure and adapt a technique to efficiently organize and share maps between particles. We evaluate our approach based on experimental results obtained by",29
icra,None,Abstractions and controllers for groups of robots in environments with obstacles,"Nora Ayanian,Vijay Kumar,","We address the problem of controlling a formation of robots in a cluttered environment. Instead of explicitly controlling the relative positions between the robots and the environment, we construct a lower-dimensional abstraction of the group that establishes a boundary for the group. We then synthesize feedback controllers that allow the abstracted group to navigate a two-dimensional environment to a desired goal position, while automatically adapting the shape of the boundary as well as the position and orientation of the group to avoid collisions between the virtual boundary and the environment. In contrast to previous approaches, we address the planning and control problems concurrently and are naturally able to establish bounds on the positions of the robots through the abstraction. The complexity of the method is independent of the number of robots which promises scalability to large teams.",23
icra,None,Probabilistic shadow information spaces,"Jingjin Yu,Steven M.

Information space concepts are used to dramatically reduce the filter complexity so that information is processed only when the shadow region (all points invisible to the sensors) changes combinatorially or targets pass in and out of view. Previous work assumed perfect observations; however, this paper extends the approach to enable probabilistic disturbances. Practical algorithms are introduced, implemented, and demonstrated for computing the filter outputs based on realistic data.",12
icra,None,Multi-agent search strategy based on centroidal Voronoi configuration,"K.R. Guruprasad,Debasish Ghose,","We propose a combined deploy and search strategy for multi-agent systems using Voronoi partition. Agents such as mobile robots (AGVs, UAVs, or USVs) search the space to acquire knowledge about the space. Lack of information about the search space is modeled as an uncertainty density distribution, which is known a priori to all the agents at the beginning of search. It is shown that when the agents are located at the centroid of Voronoi cells, computed with the perceived uncertainty density, reduction in uncertainty density is maximized. While moving toward this optimal configuration, the agents simultaneously perform search acquiring the information about the search space, thereby reducing the uncertainty density. The proposed search strategy is guaranteed to reduce the average uncertainty density to any arbitrary level. Simulation experiments are carried out to validate the proposed search strategy and compare its performance with sequential deploy and search strategy proposed in the literature. The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy performs better than sequential deploy and search in terms of faster search, and smoother and shorter robot trajectories.",7

A sufficient algebraic condition for the stability of the formation based on a generalization of the Gerschgorin circle theorem for block matrices is proposed. Furthermore, conditions under which the formation remains stable under switching topology are investigated. Simulation results are given to corroborate the theoretical results.",13

We present a distributed algorithm built around guaranteeing complete coverage of the frontier between cleared and contaminated areas while expanding the cleared area. Our frontier-based algorithm can guarantee detection of evaders in unknown, multiply-connected planar environments which may be non-polygonal. We also detail a method for storing and updating the global frontier between cleared and contaminated areas without building a global map or requiring global localization, which enables our algorithm to be truly distributed. We demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm through Player/Stage simulations.",36

The key feature of the rapid updating technique developed is the ability to increment and re-arrange the existing search tree reducing the amount of computation taken to find a new plan. The rapid updating techniques developed are combined into a receding horizon control and compared to full cold start method. The rapid updating technique demonstrated an average 62% solve time improvement over a cold start. The rapid updating method is also demonstrated for removal of obstacles from the environment and very large scale problems with 60 obstacles.",10
icra,None,Global reachability and path planning for planetary exploration with montgolfiere balloons,"Lars Blackmore,Yoshiaki Kuwata,Michael T. Wolf,Christopher Assad,,,,","Aerial vehicles are appealing systems for possible future exploration of planets and moons such as Venus and Titan, because they combine extensive coverage with high-resolution data collection and in-situ science capabilities. Recent studies have proposed the use of a montgolfiere balloon, which controls its altitude by changing the heating rate or venting gas from the balloon, but has no actuation capability in the horizontal plane. A montgolfiere can use the variation in wind with altitude to guide itself to a desired location. This paper considers the problems of determining the altitude profile that the montgolfiere should follow in order to reach its target most quickly. We provide a new method that solves this path planning problem for all possible target locations, thereby providing a reachability analysis for the entire globe. The key idea is to perform a principled simplification and decoupling of the dynamics of the montgolfiere. We then discretize the search space, converting the planning problem into a graph search problem, and use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the minimum-time path from the start location to every possible location in the graph. We demonstrate the approach on a possible Titan mission scenario.",10
icra,None,An optimization approach to rough terrain locomotion,"Matt Zucker,J. Andrew Bagnell,Christopher G. Atkeson,James Kuffner,","We present a novel approach to legged locomotion over rough terrain that is thoroughly rooted in optimization. This approach relies on a hierarchy of fast, anytime algorithms to plan a set of footholds, along with the dynamic body motions required to execute them. Components within the planning framework coordinate to exchange plans, cost-to-go estimates, and “certificates” that ensure the output of an abstract high-level planner can be realized by deeper layers of the hierarchy. The burden of careful engineering of cost functions to achieve desired performance is substantially mitigated by a simple inverse optimal control technique. Robustness is achieved by real-time re-planning of the full trajectory, augmented by reflexes and feedback control. We demonstrate the successful application of our approach in guiding the LittleDog quadruped robot over a variety of rough terrains.",84
icra,None,Exploiting domain knowledge in planning for uncertain robot systems modeled as POMDPs,"Salvatore Candido,James Davidson,Seth Hutchinson,","We propose a planning algorithm that allows user-supplied domain knowledge to be exploited in the synthesis of information feedback policies for systems modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). POMDP models, which are increasingly popular in the robotics literature, permit a planner to consider future uncertainty in both the application of actions and sensing of observations. With our approach, domain experts can inject specialized knowledge into the planning process by providing a set of local policies that are used as primitives by the planner. If the local policies are chosen appropriately, the planner can evaluate further into the future, even for large problems, which can lead to better overall policies at decreased computational cost. We use a structured approach to encode the provided domain knowledge into the value function approximation. We demonstrate our approach on a multi-robot fire fighting problem, in which a team of robots cooperates to extinguish a spreading fire, modeled as a stochastic process. The state space for this problem is significantly larger than is typical in the POMDP literature, and the geometry of the problem allows for the application of an intuitive set of local policies, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",16
icra,None,A hierarchical decoupled approach for multi robot motion planning on trees,"Ellips Masehian,Azadeh H. Nejad,","In this paper, the multi robot motion planning problem is solved through a decoupled approach, where a new algorithm for prioritizing the robots moves is developed. Assuming that the workspace is mapped into a tree graph and the initial and final configurations of robots are known, the robots' shortest start-to-goal paths on the tree are calculated independently. Then, a new rule-based prioritization scheme is applied in two phases: (a) Path Prioritization, which determines which robot can directly move along its shortest path and which robot should deviate from it, and (b) Motion Prioritization, which decides the order of robots' sequential moves. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for minimizing the number of moves by adding extra vertices to the tree.",10
icra,None,FLIRT - Interest regions for 2D range data,"Gian Diego Tipaldi,Kai O. Arras,","Local image features are used for a wide range of applications in computer vision and range imaging. While there is a great variety of detector-descriptor combinations for image data and 3D point clouds, there is no general method readily available for 2D range data. For this reason, the paper first proposes a set of benchmark experiments on detector repeatability and descriptor matching performance using known indoor and outdoor data sets for robot navigation. Secondly, the paper introduces FLIRT that stands for Fast Laser Interest Region Transform, a multi-scale interest region operator for 2D range data. FLIRT combines the best detector with the best descriptor, experimentally found in a comprehensive analysis of alternative detector and descriptor approaches. The analysis yields repeatability and matching performance results similar to the values found for features in the computer vision literature, encouraging a wide range of applications of FLIRT on 2D range data. We finally show how FLIRT can be used in conjunction with RANSAC to address the loop closing/global localization problem in SLAM in indoor as well as outdoor environments. The results demonstrate that FLIRT features have a great potential for robot navigation in terms of precision-recall performance, efficiency and generality.",120
icra,None,A hybrid framework for ego noise cancellation of a robot,"Gökhan Ince,Kazuhiro Nakadai,Tobias Rodemann,Yuji Hasegawa,,,","Noise generated due to the motion of a robot is not desired, because it deteriorates the quality and intelligibility of the sounds recorded by robot-embedded microphones. It must be reduced or cancelled to achieve automatic speech recognition with a high performance. In this work, we divide ego-motion noise problem into three subdomains of arm, leg and head motion noise, depending on their complexity and intensity levels. We investigate methods that make use of single-channel and multi-channel processing in order to suppress ego noise separately. For this purpose, a framework consisting of a microphone-array-based geometric source separation, a consequent post filtering process and a parallel module for template subtraction is used. Furthermore, a control mechanism is proposed, which is based on signal-to-noise ratio and instantaneously detected motions, to switch to the most suitable method to deal with the current type of noise. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a humanoid robot using automatic speech recognition (ASR). The preliminary results of isolated word recognition show the effectiveness of our methods by increasing the word correct rates up to 50% compared to the single channel recognition in arm and leg motion noises and up to 25% in very strong head motion noises.",27

icra,None,Novelty detection and 3D shape retrieval using superquadrics and multi-scale sampling for autonomous mobile robots,"P. Drews,P. Núñez,R. Rocha,M. Campos,J. Dias,","There are several applications for which it is important to both detect and communicate changes in data models. For instance, in some mobile robotics applications (e.g. surveillance) a robot needs to detect significant changes in the environment (e.g. a layout change) which it may achieve by comparing current data provided by its sensors with previously acquired data (e.g. map) of the environment. This often constitutes an extremely challenging task due to the large amounts of data that must be compared in real-time. This paper proposes a framework to detect, and represent changes through a compact model. The main steps of the procedure are: multi-scale sampling to reduce the computation burden; change detection based on Gaussian mixture models; fitting superquadrics to detected changes; and refinement and optimization using the split and merge paradigm. Experimental results in various real and simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's feasibility and robustness with large datasets.",46

Though the multi-class classifier can obtain high classification accuracy, it can not detect the noise activities and unknown activities, and the system has no extendable recognition capability. In this paper, we proposed a recognition system which can recognize known activities and detect unknown activities simultaneously. For each known activity, one one-class classification model is built up and the combined one-class classification models are used to judge whether a test sample belongs to known activities. For the known samples, the multi-class classifier is used to recognize their types. For the continuous unknown samples, based on segmentation algorithm, training samples of new activities are extracted and added into the recognition system to extend the system's recognition capability.",47

The FID sensor can measure the indentation depth of a semi-spherical indenter and the tissue reaction force simultaneously. It make use of with fiber optical fiber sensing method measure indentation depth and force and is small enough to fit through a standard trocar port with a diameter of 11 mm.

The paper presents modified kinematics for constrained continuum robots and introduces the concept of Fixed Centrode Deviation (FCD) for continuum robots. It is shown that the change in fixed centrode locus may be used for detection of contact and for contact location estimation. An alternative method for contact detection using Joint Force Deviation (JFD) is investigated and a lower bound for contact detectability is derived while considering uncertainties in joint forces. An estimation framework for the location of contact is presented based on FCD and the constrained kinematics Jacobian of the continuum robot. These methods are validated by simulation and experiments. This framework may be used for enhancing the safety of robotic surgical slaves and for exploration of unknown environments such as in scenarios of search and rescue.,59
icra,None,A force sensing Automated Insertion Tool for cochlear electrode implantation,"Daniel Schurzig,Robert F. Labadie,Andreas Hussong,Thomas S. Rau,,","Cochlear electrode insertion is a challenging manual procedure. One technique requires the physician to coordinate the motions of an electrode array approximately 1mm in diameter and the smaller stylet within it, using miniature forceps. A new minimally invasive access technique precludes forceps insertion because the electrode must travel through a small-diameter drilled hole to reach the cochlear access point. To address this, we present an automated insertion tool. This second generation device not only enables deployment in the minimally invasive setting, but also makes insertion velocity profiles repeatable and can sense insertion forces. Force sensing is essential because insertion forces can indicate impending damage to cochlear membranes, but are below the thresholds that can be sensed by human hands. The Automated Insertion Tool we present is designed to be compact and lightweight for straightforward integration into the operating room environment. It is able to insert an electrode with a resolution of less than 1μm, achieve velocities of up to 5 mm/sec and resolve forces as small as 0.005 N.",18

This feedback source has also applications in endovascular surgery simulation for human skills and medical tools evaluation. For that purpose we consider photoelastic effect, as birefringence produced by light retardation relates with the stress inside the photoelastic materials. In this research a polariscope was designed for urethane elastomer vasculature models, the photoelastic coefficient of urethane elastomer was measured, and the camera system was calibrated to quantify and reduce error of the measurement system. An average error of 3.6% was found for the pressure range of 70-189 mmHg inside the model of urethane elastomer, this enables to calculate accurately stress in vasculature models during Human Blood Pressure Simulation (HBPS). That way we will be able to compare in a closed loop stress produced by HBPS and by the catheter motion when manipulated by a robot.",22

Instead of using a sequence of samples from one or just a few coherent sequences, the idea of identifying nonlinear dynamic models at distinct points in the state space is considered. In this way, the placement of the experiment points is fully flexible with respect to the set of reachable points. Also, a method for model-based generation of prediction errors is proposed, which is used to compute an a-priori estimate of the sample covariance of the prediction error. This covariance matrix may be used to approximate the Fisher information matrix a-priori. The availability of the Fisher matrix a-priori is a prerequisite for experiment optimization with respect to covariance in the parameter estimates. This work is driven by the problem of parameter identification of hydraulic models.

When such a needle is inserted into soft tissue, it bends due to the asymmetric geometry of the bevel tip. This insertion with bending is not completely repeatable. We characterize the deviations in needle tip pose (position and orientation) by performing repeated needle insertions into artificial tissue. The base of the needle is pushed at a constant speed without rotating, and the covariance of the distribution of the needle tip pose is computed from experimental data. We develop the closed-form equations to describe how the covariance varies with different model parameters. We estimate the model parameters by matching the closed-form covariance and the experimentally obtained covariance. In this work, we use a needle model modified from a previously developed model with two noise parameters. The modified needle model uses three noise parameters to better capture the stochastic behavior of the needle insertion. The modified needle model provides an improvement of the covariance error from 26.1% to 6.55%.",31

Further, the authors introduce a scheme for steering the robot by correctly selecting the proper bladders to inflate so that motive force is developed in a specified direction.

In order to endow robots with similar capabilities, we must implement large degrees of freedom, equivalent to animals, into the robots' bodies. For taming large degrees of freedom, the concept of autonomous decentralized control plays a pivotal role. However, a systematic way of designing such autonomous decentralized control system is still missing. Aiming at understanding the principles that underlie animals' locomotion, in our early studies, we focused on true slime mold, a primitive living organism, and extracted a decentralized control scheme. In order to validate this control scheme, this paper presents a soft-bodied amoeboid robot inspired by true slime mold. Significant features of this robot are twofold: (1) the robot has truly soft and deformable body stemming from real-time tunable springs and a balloon, the former is used for an outer skin of the body and the latter serves as protoplasm; and (2) a fully decentralized control using coupled oscillators with completely local sensory feedback mechanism is realized by exploiting the long-distance physical interaction between the body parts stemming from both the softness of the body and the law of conservation of protoplasmic mass. Experimental results show that this robot exhibits truly supple locomotion without relying on any hierarchical structure.

Whereas insects like the desert ant with very limited computing and memory capacities solve this task with great efficiency. Thus, the understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of insect navigation can inform us on how to build simpler yet robust autonomous robots. Based on recent developments in insect neuroethology and cognitive psychology, we propose a method for landmark navigation in dynamic environments. Our method enables the navigator to learn the reliability of landmarks using an expectation reinforcement method. For that end, we implemented a real-time neuronal model based on the Distributed Adaptive Control framework. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of learning the stability of landmarks by reinforcing its expectations. Also, the proposed mechanism allows the navigator to optimally restore its confidence when its expectations are violated. We also perform navigational experiments with real ants to compare with the results of our model. The behavior of the proposed autonomous navigator closely resembles real ant navigational behavior. Moreover, our model explains navigation in dynamic environments as a memory consolidation process, harnessing expectations and their violations.",14

Experimental data collected by measuring the tendon tension forces during both the pulling and the release phase are presented, and theoretical models reproducing the tendon behavior with increasing fidelity are proposed. In particular, the friction arising from the interaction between the tendon pathway and the tendon itself is characterized by means of a LuGre-like dynamic friction model. The introduction of a dynamic friction model allows to reproduce in simulation some effects arising during experimental activities that cannot be reproduced employing an equivalent static friction model.

In contrast to the conventional methods which determine a vanishing point (a pair of vanishing points at a spherical image) from a group of parallel lines, the proposed method first determines a pair of vanishing points by the two parallel lines and then compute the other pair of vanishing points from the remaining line in terms of the inherent relation of the H-pattern. The experimental result of estimating the pose of a camera mounted at the rear of a vehicle is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",15

This study focuses on the recognition of situations involving two vehicles at intersections. For each vehicle, a set of possible future motion trajectories is estimated and rated based on a motion database for a time interval of 2-4 seconds ahead. Realistic situations are generated by a pairwise combination of these individual motion trajectories and classified according to nine categories with a polynomial classifier. In the proposed framework, situations are penalised for which the time to collision significantly exceeds the typical human reaction time. The correspondingly favoured situations are combined by a probabilistic framework, resulting in a more reliable situation recognition and collision detection than obtained based on independent motion hypotheses. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world differential GPS data set acquired during a test drive of 10 km, including three road intersections. Our method is typically able to recognise the situation correctly about 1-2 seconds before the distance to the intersection centre becomes minimal.",86

In addition, our algorithm explicitly considers the kinematic and dynamic constraints of a simple-airplane and uses the notion of variable reciprocity when choosing velocities to ensure that simple-airplanes that are less constrained take more responsibility for avoiding collisions.

We define a measurable criterion to on-line detect an instability or a potential instability of the plant, and right after this criterion is fulfilled, we switch to the on-line trajectory generator that acts as an open-loop pose control submodule in the switched-system. The on-line trajectory generation algorithm guides the system under consideration of kinematic motion constraints to a desired target state of motion that can be specified beforehand (e.g., zero-velocity in a pre-defined position).

Such a state is an Inevitable Collision State (ICS). The ICS concept is particularly useful for navigation in dynamic environments because it takes into account the future behaviour of the moving objects. Accordingly it requires a model of the future evolution of the environment. In the real-world, the future trajectories of the obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation of the ICS concept which incorporates uncertainty in the model of the future trajectories of the obstacles.

Existing approaches that employ Time-of-Flight cameras suffer from the limited field-of-view of the sensor. To overcome this issue, we mount the camera on the head of our anthropomorphic robot Dynamaid. This allows to change the gaze direction through the robot's pan-tilt neck and its torso yaw joint. The proposed obstacle detection method is robust against kinematic inaccuracies and noise in the range measurements. The gaze controller takes motion blur effects into account and controls the gaze depending on the robot's motion and the obstacles in its vicinity. In experiments, we demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to avoid obstacles that the laser range finder can not perceive. We also compare our active gaze control strategy with a fixed gaze orientation.",42

An efficient on-line algorithm is introduced to determine whether a robot at a future time t and a configuration q will be guaranteed collision-free, directly from real-world sensor data of the robot's environment at the current time τ, using stereo vision sensor. Such a problem can be formulated as checking the intersection between the so-called dynamic envelope, which relates to the robot at a configuration-time (CT) point (q; t) and the current sensing time τ, and the atomic obstacles, which are obtained directly from low-level sensory data at τ.

To cope with large out-of-plane rotations and translation in-depth, we extend conventional head tracking with a single camera to a stereo-based framework. To achieve more robust motion estimation even under time-varying lighting conditions, we incorporate illumination correction into the aforementioned framework. We approximate the face image variations due to illumination changes as a linear combination of illumination bases. Also, by computing the illumination bases online from the registered face images, after estimating the 3D head poses, user-specific illumination bases can be obtained, and therefore illumination-robust tracking without a prior learning process can be possible. Furthermore, our unified stereo-based tracking is approximated as a linear least-squares problem; a closed-form solution is then provided. After recovering the full-motions of the head, we can register face images with pose variations into stabilized-view images, which are suitable for pose-robust face recognition. To verify the feasibility and applicability of our approach, we performed extensive experiments with three sets of challenging image sequences.",1

Both an exact solution and a simplified method are proposed to solve the regression problem.

We consider the problem of tracking a static target from a bird's-eye view camera mounted to the underside of a quadrotor UAV. We begin by proposing a target detection algorithm, which we then execute on a collection of video frames acquired from four different experiments. We show how the efficacy of the target detection algorithm changes as a function of altitude. We summarise this efficacy into a table which we denote the observation model. We then run the target detection algorithm on a sequence of video frames and use parameters from the observation model to update a recursive Bayesian estimator. The estimator keeps track of the probability that a target is currently in view of the camera, which we refer to more simply as target presence. Between each target detection event the UAV changes position and so the sensing region changes. Under certain assumptions regarding the movement of the UAV, the proportion of new information may be approximated to a value, which we then use to weight the prior in each iteration of the estimator. Through a series of experiments we show how the value of the prior for unseen regions, the altitude of the UAV and the camera sampling rate affect the accuracy of the estimator. Our results indicate that there is no single optimal sampling rate for all tested scenarios. We also show how the prior may be used as a mechanism for tuning the estimator according to whether a high false positive or high false negative probability is preferable.",65

Assembly at the microscale harbors many difficult challenges due to scaling of physics, stringent tolerance budget, high precision requirements, limited work volumes, and so on. These difficulties warrant new control and planning algorithms, different than their macro-scale counterparts. In this paper, we use precision metrics to formalize a hybrid controller for automated MEMS assembly.

icra,None,Motion generation through biologically-inspired torque pulses,"J. Neubert,N. J.

One of the major obstacles to producing reactive motions with contemporary controllers is that they rely on kinematic commands. The performance of short duration motions requiring large accelerations is dominated by the motion's dynamics; kinematic commands without an accurate dynamic model of the robot and task will lead to poor performance. Conversely, this paper presents a biologically inspired “torque command” that allows the dynamics of the motion to be communicated to the controller. The commands can be produced with only minor modifications to any existing control scheme that will not impact traditional operation. In addition, sensory input can be mapped directly to presented commands for latency sensitive tasks. The ability of the new commands to express a broad range of motions with a small number of parameters is shown experimentally.

The manner in which these changes affect the current balance and how to combine the three strategies are discussed. The proposed methods are implemented as part of an online walking control system with short cycle pattern generation and are evaluated using the HRP-2 full-sized humanoid robot.",84
icra,None,Trajectory generation with natural ZMP references for the biped walking robot SURALP,"Evrim Taşkiran,Metin Yilmaz,Özer Koca,Utku Seven,Kemalettin Erbatur,","Bipedal locomotion has good obstacle avoidance properties. A robot with human appearance has advantages in human-robot communication. However, walking control is difficult due to the complex robot dynamics involved. Stable reference generation is significant in walking control. The Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) and the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) criterion are applied in a number of studies for stable walking reference generation of biped robots. This is the main route of reference generation in this paper too. We employ a natural and continuous ZMP reference trajectory for a stable and human-like walk. The ZMP reference trajectories move forward under the sole of the support foot when the robot body is supported by a single leg. Robot center of mass (CoM) trajectory is obtained from predefined ZMP reference trajectories by Fourier series approximation. We reported simulation results with this algorithm in our previous works. This paper presents the first experimental results. Also the use of a ground push phase before foot take-offs reported in our previous works is tested first time together with our ZMP based reference trajectory. The reference generation strategy is tested via walking experiments on the 29 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) human sized full body humanoid robot SURALP (Sabanci University Robotics Research Laboratory Platform). Experiments indicate that the proposed reference trajectory generation technique is successful.",38

It is based on a new approximation algorithm intended to cope with this specific problem. The result obtained is used on the robot HRP-2, and enables it to guess a step feasibility 40,000 times faster (in 9μs) than with the normal verification process. As a consequence some advance is made towards fast online motion (re)planning based on a continuous set of possible steps.",21
icra,None,Analysis on a friction based “twirl” for biped robots,"Kanako Miura,Shin'ichiro Nakaoka,Mitsuharu Morisawa,Fumio Kanehiro,,,","This paper presents preliminary results and analysis on generating turning motion of a humanoid robot by slipping the feet on the ground. Humans unconsciously exploit the fact that our feet slip on the ground; such slip motion is necessary for humanoids so as to realize sophisticated human-like motions. In order to generate the slip motion, we need to predict the amount of slip. We propose the hypothesis that the turning motion is caused by the effect of minimizing the power generated by floor friction. A model of rotation by friction force is described on the basis of our hypothesis. The case that a robot applies the same force on both feet is discussed; then, we extend the discussion to the case of different force distribution. The hypothesis is verified through experiments with a humanoid robot HRP-2.",39

icra,None,Designing behaviors to improve observability for relative localization of AUVs,"Gianluca Antonelli,Andrea Caiti,Vincenzo Calabrò,Stefano Chiaverini,","Coordinated control of marine vehicles poses challenging problems, among them the possibility to use the vehicles, in addition to their nominal mission, also to achieve a relative localization task. To the purpose, the use of a surface, GPS-equipped, vehicle and one or several underwater vehicles may be envisaged. The latters can communicate among them by acoustic modems; those devices can also be used as ranging measurement units thus providing an additional information that, together with the common sensor equipment for marine vehicles, might be used for relative localization. This paper investigates how the vehicles' movements can be commanded in order to help the relative localization by a proper analysis of the system observability and a corresponding proper definition of the vehicles movements; critical situations for the relative observability, that corresponds to common movements, are then avoided. Numerical simulations on the mathematical model of the Fòlaga hybrid underwater vehicle confirm the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated behavioral approach.",22

In this paper, an uncertainty analysis of a Fourier Mellin based image registration algorithm is introduced, which to our knowledge is the first of its kind involving spectral registration.

icra,None,Geometric formation control for autonomous underwater vehicles,"Huizhen Yang,Fumin Zhang,","This paper presents a novel approach based on Jacobi shape theory and geometric reduction for formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We consider a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model for the horizontal motion of each AUV that has control inputs over surge force and yaw moment. By using the Jacobi transform, the horizontal dynamics of AUVs are expressed as dynamics for formation shape, formation motion and vehicle orientation. The system decouples when additional symmetries in vehicle design are presented. Hence formation shape controllers, formation motion controllers, and vehicle orientation controllers can be designed separately. This approach reduces the complexity of formation controllers. We use the model for ODIN as an example to demonstrate the controller design process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the controllers.",46
icra,None,A measurement model for tracking hand-object state during dexterous manipulation,"Craig Corcoran,Robert Platt,","It is frequently accepted in the manipulation literature that tactile sensing is needed to improve the precision of robot manipulation. However, there is no consensus on how this may be achieved. This paper applies particle filtering to the problem of localizing the pose and shape of an object that the robot touches. We are motivated by the situation where the robot has enclosed its fingers around an object but has not yet grasped it. This might be the case just prior to grasping or when the robot is holding on to something fixtured elsewhere in the environment. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new model for position measurements of points on the robot manipulator that tactile sensing indicates are touching the object. We also propose a model for points on the manipulator that tactile measurements indicate are not touching the object. Finally, we characterize the approach in simulation and use it to localize an object that Robonaut 2 holds in its hand.",53
icra,None,External sensorless dynamic object manipulation by a dual soft-fingered robotic hand with torsional fingertip motion,"Kenji Tahara,Keigo Maruta,Motoji Yamamoto,","This paper proposes a novel object manipulation method by using a dual soft-fingered robotic hand system, in which each fingertip has a torsional joint. By using the torsional motion of the fingertips, a novel 3-dimensional dynamic object manipulation without use of any external sensing can be achieved even though the hand system has only two fingers. Firstly, our proposed system, which includes contact models between each fingertip and surfaces of an object, is modeled. A rolling contact between each fingertip and the object surfaces can be allowed because our proposed system has soft and deformable hemispheric fingertips. Moreover, a torsional contact model between each fingertip and the object surfaces is newly proposed. It is based on an assumption that the torsional motion induces an elastic strain potential. Secondly, a dynamic object manipulation control method is designed. The control signal is composed of four parts, the one is for grasping the object stably, the second one is for controlling a position of the object, the third one is for controlling an attitude of the object, and the last one is for the torsional fingertip motion. A numerical simulation based on our model is performed, and a manipulation experiment by using our developed setup is performed. The usefulness of our proposed method is demonstrated through these results.",14

This paper focuses on analyzing dynamic sliding motion of a 2-dimensional (2-D) soft fingertip on a plane. To investigate the deformation of the fingertip during this process, we consider the soft fingertip as if it was composed of a finite number of elastic cantilevers which are compressible and bendable. Simulation will be carried out firstly on this 2-D model of soft fingertip, focusing on the analysis of incident slip-page. After that, various experimental results will be shown to verify this model.",8
icra,None,Dynamic object manipulation using a virtual frame by a triple soft-fingered robotic hand,"Kenji Tahara,Suguru Arimoto,Morio Yoshida,","This paper proposes a novel object manipulation method to regulate the position and attitude of an object in the task space with dynamic stability by using a triple soft-fingered robotic hand system. In our previous works, a dynamic object grasping method without use of any external sensing, called “the Blind Grasping”, has been proposed. Although stable grasping in a dynamic sense has been realized by the method, a simultaneous object position and attitude control has not yet been treated, so far. In this paper, instead of using any information of the real object position and attitude, virtual data of object position and attitude are introduced by defining a virtual frame. By using the virtual information, a control signal to regulate the virtual object position and attitude without use of any external sensing is designed. The usefulness of our proposed control method even under the existence of nonholonomic rolling constraints is illustrated through a numerical simulation result.",89
icra,None,Regrasp planning of three-fingered hand for a polygonal object,"Thanathorn Phoka,Attawith Sudsang,",This paper addresses the problem of regrasp planning for a polygon with a large number of edges. We propose an approach for computing sequences of finger repositioning that allow the hand to switch from one grasping configuration to another while maintaining force-closure during the entire process. The proposed approach is based on exploring a structure called switching graph. Complete sets of two-fingered force-closure grasps are computed in grasp space. Adjacent sets of force-closure grasps are merged into a connected set which allows finger repositioning by continuous movements of fingers on adjacent polygonal edges. We present an output sensitive algorithm to construct a switching graph from the obtained connected sets. A method for finding the optimal solution of a finger switching is also presented. The proposed approach has been implemented and some preliminary results are presented.,7

In particular this paper focuses on the user-centred design approach taken to develop a robot able to engage in meaningful interaction with different typologies of disable children - Autistic children, Moderate Mentally Retarded children and Severe Motor Impaired children. Modularity and configurability contribute to the flexibility of the system in creating rewarding games that can be easily understood by the child and can promote fun and learning. Other key features of the system are the combination of autonomous and user-controlled behaviour and a strong emphasis on identity and expressiveness that can be dynamically adapted during play.

This paper examines viability of measuring psycho physiological responses to different robotic tasks. The heart rate, skin conductance, respiration and peripheral skin temperature were observed to verify if physical activity obstructs useful recordings and to verify responses in stroke population. 30 healthy subjects were checked with a control task, a purely mental task and task with physical load. 23 subacute stroke persons did a control task, pick and place task (+ inverted version) and Stroop test, same as 22 healthy control subjects. Psycho physiological measurements yielded results even in the presence of physical load and can thus potentially be useful for rehabilitation robotics. Similar responses as in healthy control group were found in the stroke group. Skin conductance response frequency, respiratory rate, skin conductance and skin temperature (all changes from baseline) were confirmed as parameters signaling changes in arousal and valence of both, stroke and control groups.",2

The goal is that the robot can automatically distinguish a target speech from its own speech and other sound sources in a reverberant environment. We focus on the multi-channel semi-blind ICA (MCSB-ICA), which is one of the sound source separation methods with a microphone array, to achieve such an audition system because it can separate sound source signals including reverberations with few assumptions on environments. The evaluation of MCSB-ICA has been limited to robot's speech separation and reverberation separation. In this paper, we evaluate MCSB-ICA extensively by applying it to multi-source separation problems under common reverberant environments. Experimental results prove that MCSB-ICA outperforms conventional ICA by 30 points in automatic speech recognition performance.",6

We contribute our WiFi localization algorithm which continuously uses the perceptual model to update the robot location in conjunction with its odometry data.

icra,None,Improved GPS sensor model for mobile robots in urban terrain,"Daniel Maier,Alexander Kleiner,","Autonomous robot navigation in out-door scenarios gains increasing importance in various growing application areas. Whereas in non-urban domains such as deserts the problem of successful GPS-based navigation appears to be almost solved, navigation in urban domains particularly in the close vicinity of buildings is still a challenging problem. In such situations GPS accuracy significantly drops down due to multiple signal reflections with larger objects causing the so-called multipath error. In this paper we contribute a novel approach for incorporating multipath errors into the conventional GPS sensor model by analyzing environmental structures from online generated point clouds. The approach has been validated by experimental results conducted with an all-terrain robot operating in scenarios requiring close-to-building navigation. Presented results show that positioning accuracy can significantly be improved within urban domains.",91

In this paper, we propose a compact binary code (e.g. 32bit code) landmark representation by employing the semantic hashing technique from web-scale image retrieval. We show how well such a binary representation achieves compactness of a landmark database while maintaining efficiency of the localization system. In our contribution, we investigate the cost-performance, the semantic gap, the saliency evaluation using the presented techniques as well as challenge to further reduce the resources (#bits) per landmark. Experiments using a high-speed car-like robot show promising results.",15
icra,None,A general Gaussian-mixture approach for range-only mapping using multiple hypotheses,"F. Caballero,L Merino,A. Ollero,","Radio signal-based localization and mapping is becoming more interesting as applications involving the collaboration between robots and static wireless devices are more common. Under certain assumptions, the problem is basically equivalent to the range-only localization and mapping problem. The paper presents a method for mapping with a mobile robot the position of a set of nodes using radio signal measurements. It uses Gaussian Mixtures for undelayed initialization of the position of the wireless nodes. The paper shows how the approach can be integrated within a Kalman Filter.

icra,None,Updating control modes based on terrain classification,"Eric Coyle,Emmanuel G. Collins,Liang Lu,","The need for terrain-dependent control systems on AGVs is evident when considering the variety of outdoor terrains many AGVs encounter. Although the idea of using terrain classification algorithms to identify the terrain and then update the control modes is well-established, the problem of how to intelligently update the control modes based on classifications has been left relatively unaddressed. This paper presents a simplistic rule, called the update rule, which decides when to change control modes based on past and present terrain classifications and is tuned using empirical data. Using experimental data from the experimental Unmanned Vehicle (XUV) mobile robot, this update rule is shown here to be both robust to misclassiflcations as well as sensitive to terrain transitions. This paper also develops and implements a sliding horizon approach to reaction-based terrain classification for improved sensitivity to terrain transitions. The update rule structure presented here is applicable to reaction and vision based terrain classification of individual terrains.",12

Flexible path-end adjustments and adaptive look-ahead are introduced to a state lattice planning approach with waypoint control. For a given processing horizon, this increases search coverage and reduces planning error. This tramming approach has been successfully fielded on a 98-ton autonomous blast hole drill rig used in iron ore mining in Western Australia.

icra,None,Real-world validation of three tipover algorithms for mobile robots,"Philip R. Roan,Aaron Burmeister,Amin Rahimi,Kevin Holz,David Hooper,","Mobile robot tipover is a concern as it can create dangerous situations for operators and bystanders, cause collateral damage to the surrounding environment, and result in an aborted mission. Algorithms have been developed by others to assess the stability of the robot, and many of these algorithms have been demonstrated using simulated data. In order to verify that these algorithms accurately match real-world behavior, we have collected data of a mobile robot tipping over and then compared this data to the stability measures provided by three algorithms: Zero-Moment Point (ZMP), Force-Angle stability measure (FA), and Moment-Height Stability measure (MHS). A small mobile robot platform based on the iRobot PackBot drove a course including ramps and obstacles; an IMU and GPS provided inertial and positional data for the algorithms, and the actual tipover event is determined from video footage of the tests. The average normalized measure at tipover event initiation was found to be 0.665 for ZMP, -0.094 for FA, and 0.023 for MHS, where a value of 1 corresponds to resting stability. Standard deviations were 0.38, 0.84, and 0.67, respectively. The measures show a significant amount of noise, which is likely due to the vibrations caused by movement of the tracks and could be reduced by employing additional filtering during data collection. The preliminary real-world data validates these tipover algorithms as able to assess robot stability, and they can be used as part of a tipover avoidance system.",65
icra,None,Inferring geometry from imagery - Enabling high speed traversal,"Gregory Broten,David Mackay,","Robotic vehicles operating in outdoor environments, commonly referred to as unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), are confronted with unstructured/semi-structured environments that are variable in nature. The geographical location significantly influences the environment's appearance, there are longer term seasonal cycles, as well as immediate affects such as the weather and lighting conditions. This environmental diversity has long caused researchers considerable grief, as developing a generalized terrain classification algorithm has proven to be very difficult. Researchers have skirted this problem by relying upon ranging sensors and constructing 2½D or, more recently, 3D world representations. Although geometric representations have been used extensively orientation errors limit the lookahead distance. An important UGV capability is high speed traversal, hence extending the lookahead distance that in turn increases the maximum attainable vehicle speed is an active area of research. This focus on high speed traversal in variable environments has pushed researchers to investigate techniques that allow learning from experience, in a more human like manner. This paper presents Defence R&D Canada - Suffield's progress in extending a 2½D world representation using vision and learning to infer geometry.",0
icra,None,Automated rock recognition with wavelet feature space projection and Gaussian Process classification,"Hang Zhou,Sildomar T. Monteiro,Peter Hatherly,Fabio Ramos,Eric Nettleton,,","A crucial component of an autonomous mine is the ability to infer rock types from mechanical measurements of a drill rig. The major difficulty lies in that there is not a clear one to one correspondence between the mechanical measurements and the rock type due to the mechanical noise as well as the variety of the rock geology. This paper proposes a novel wavelet feature space projection approach to robustly classify rock types from drilling data with Gaussian Process classification. Instead of applying Gaussian Process classifier directly to the given measurement pieces, a group of wavelet features are extracted from the neighboring region of a specific data point. Gaussian Process classification is then carried out on the new extracted wavelet features. By putting neighboring data points into consideration rather than dealing with each data point individually, the underlying pattern can be better captured and more robust to noise and data variations. Experimental results on synthetic data as well as varied real world drilling data have shown the effectiveness of our approach.",11
icra,None,Multi-robot coordination with periodic connectivity,"Geoffrey Hollinger,Sanjiv Singh,","We consider the problem of multi-robot coordination subject to constraints on the configuration. Specifically, we examine the case in which a mobile network of robots must search, survey, or cover an environment while remaining connected. While many algorithms utilize continual connectivity for such tasks, we relax this requirement and introduce the idea of periodic connectivity, where the network must regain connectivity at a fixed interval. We show that, in some cases, this problem reduces to the well-studied NP-hard multi-robot informative path planning (MIPP) problem, and we propose an online algorithm that scales linearly in the number of robots and allows for arbitrary periodic connectivity constraints. We prove theoretical performance guarantees and validate our approach in the coordinated search domain in simulation and in real-world experiments. Our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a gradient method that requires continual connectivity and performs competitively with a market-based approach, but at a fraction of the computational cost.",104

The grid was used to ensure collision-free transitions between formations, coordinated by a centralized controller. This paper is an extension of that work, proposing control laws that are computed in a distributed way while still ensuring collision-free formation reconfigurations. Furthermore, we consider an extension of the group rendezvous problem. The agents are required to meet at the rendezvous point and establish consensus on formation state. Again, the grid abstraction is used to describe the formation state. Nonholonomic constraints of agent motion are taken into account explicitly. As our approach is communication-based, we also examine the effects of temporary communication loss.",13

icra,None,Bifurcations of optimal solutions for coordinated robotic systems: Numerical and homotopy methods,"Baoyang Deng,Andrés K. Valenzuela,Bill Goodwine,","This paper presents the relatively rich and interesting bifurcation structure that is present in the nature of optimal solutions to a multi-robot formation control problem. The problem considered is a two point nonlinear boundary-value problem that can only be solved numerically. Since common numerical solution techniques such as the shooting method are local in nature and hence are difficult to use to find multiple solutions, an alternative formulation of the problem is presented that can be solved through homotopy methods for polynomial systems. These methods are guaranteed to find all solutions within the resolution of the system description's discretization. Specifically, this paper studies a group of unicycle-like autonomous mobile robots operating in a 2-dimensional obstacle-free environment. Each robot has a predefined initial state and final state and the problem is to find the optimal path between two states for every robot. The path is optimized with respect to the control effort and the deviation from a desired formation. The bifurcation parameter is the relative weight given to penalizing the deviation from the desired formation versus control effort. It is shown that as this number varies, bifurcations of solutions are obtained. Considering the common use of optimization methods in robotic navigation and coordination problems, understanding the existence and structure of bifurcating and multiple solutions is of great importance in robotics.",4
icra,None,On agreement problems with gossip algorithms in absence of common reference frames,"Mauro Franceschelli,Andrea Gasparri,","In this paper a novel approach to the problem of decentralized agreement toward a common point in space in a multi-agent system is proposed. Our method allows the agents to agree on the relative location of the network centroid respect to themselves, on a common reference frame and therefore on a common heading. Using this information a global positioning system for the agents using only local measurements can be achieved. In the proposed scenario, an agent is able to sense the distance between itself and its neighbors and the direction in which it sees its neighbors with respect to its local reference frame. Furthermore only point-to-point asynchronous communications between neighboring agents are allowed thus achieving robustness against random communication failures. The proposed algorithms can be thought as general tools to locally retrieve global information usually not available to the agents.",31

This solution is well adapted to plan safe and acceptable moves of the robot in the vicinity of humans. It is also a simple solution to approximate any trajectory and synchronize different robots or element of the robots. These curves have a simple representation, can be computed quickly and when used in a fitting algorithm can build controller.",45

Although sophisticated cooperative control is essential to avoid destructive internal force in general cooperative transfer task, we propose a geometrical caging strategy which can simplify a hand-over task. To solve a problem of capture region mismatch during caging state transition, the proposed strategy does not utilize additional actuators and sensors but a compliant mechanism whose displacement range can be changed automatically by its configuration. By experiments, it was confirmed that the caging strategy can make the hand-over task drastically easy and robust, and a winch type quasi-compliant mechanism is effective to the problem of capture region mismatch.",11

This descriptor can be learned quickly from a single training image and is easily adaptable to different objects. The descriptor is integrated into the observation model of a visual tracker based on the well known Condensation algorithm. We show that the approach is applicable to a large variety of objects and in different environments with cluttered backgrounds and a moving camera. The method is robust to illumination and viewpoint changes and applicable to indoor as well as outdoor scenes.",51
icra,None,Visual tracking for non-rigid objects using Rao-Blackwellized particle filter,"Jungho Kim,Chaehoon Park,In-So Kweon,","Particle filters have been used for visual tracking during long periods because they enable effective estimation for non-linear and non-Gaussian distributions. However, particle filter-based tracking approaches suffer from occlusion and deformation of the target objects, which result in the large difference between the current observations and the target model. Thus, we present a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)-based tracking algorithm that effectively estimates the joint distribution for the target state and the target model; in the proposed method, the target object is tracked by using the particle filter while the target model is simultaneously updated on the basis of the on-line approximation of a mixture of Gaussians. To ensure the robustness to occlusion, we represent the target model by 16 orientation histograms that are spatially divided, and individually update each histogram through a video sequence. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method under occlusion and deformation of the target objects.",13
icra,None,A salient feature and scene semantics based attention model for human tracking on mobile robots,"Hong Liu,Huijun He,","It is a great challenge to perform robust tracking for a mobile robot owing to dynamic environments. Also, fast motion or abrupt jerk of the robotic camera poses a severe threat for continuous tracking. To address these problems, a novel attention model is proposed motivated by human attention mechanism which consists of low level salient feature and high level scene semantics. The low level layer extracts color and motion feature to obtain combined feature probability map. In semantic level, the ADM(attention distribution map) is computed by applying an attenuation function on the combined feature map which is motivated by human's foveal vision. The object position is found using CAMSHIFT algorithm in ADM. And this layer also generates a region-based SSG(scene semantics graph). When robot moves abnormally, the model detects candidate regions in color saliency map and then attention shifts from one region to the next and check it by elastically matching SSG until the target is recovered. Experiments in several kinds of environments give promising results and show that this model is robust for mobile robotic tracking. When camera moves steadily, a little fast or even jerks very abruptly, it can keep continuous tracking.",6
icra,None,Visual tracking and segmentation using appearance and spatial information of patches,"Junqiu Wang,Yasushi Yagi,","Object tracking and segmentation find a wide range of applications in robotics. Tracking and segmentation are difficult in cluttered and dynamic backgrounds. We propose a tracking and segmentation algorithm in which tracking and segmentation are performed consecutively. We separate input images into disjoint patches using an efficient oversegmentation algorithm. Objects and their background are described by bags of patches. We classify the patches in a new frame by searching k nearest neighbors. K-d trees are constructed using these patches to reduce computational complexity. Target location is estimated coarsely by running the mean-shift algorithm. Based on the estimated locations, we classify the patches again using appearance and spatial information. This strategy out-performs direct segmentation of patches based on appearance information only. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides good performance on difficult sequences with clutter.",6
icra,None,Using multiple hypothesis in model-based tracking,"Céline Teulière,Eric Marchand,Laurent Eck,","Classic registration methods for model-based tracking try to align the projected edges of a 3D model with the edges of the image. However, wrong matches at low level can make these methods fail. This paper presents a new approach allowing to retrieve multiple hypothesis on the camera pose from multiple low-level hypothesis. These hypothesis are integrated into a particle filtering framework to guide the particle set toward the peaks of the distribution. Experiments on simulated and real video sequences show the improvement in robustness of the resulting tracker.",47
icra,None,Breathing motion compensation for robot assisted laser osteotomy,"Martin Busack,Guillaume Morel,Delphine Bellot,","This article proposes a control scheme for robot assisted laser osteotomy. Laser osteotomy consists in cutting a bone precisely with a laser. To achieve accurate cuts the laser has to be precisely sent to a desired pose with respect to the bone. In the proposed approach, a robot is used to position an end-effector with a scanhead, which deflects the cutting laser. The poses of the laser and of the bone are measured thanks to an optical tacking system which tracks the positions of optical markers placed on the bone and on the scanhead. The control of the robot is then performed thanks to a position-based visual servoing control scheme. In the case of bones affected by breathing motions, for instance the thorax bones, this control scheme is enhanced with a learning algorithm in order to compensate breathing motions. The main contribution of this paper is this control algorithm for motions compensation.",14
icra,None,Beating heart motion prediction for robust visual tracking,"Rogério Richa,Antônio P L Bó,Philippe Poignet,","In the context of minimally invasive cardiac surgery, robotic assistance has significantly helped surgeons to overcome difficulties related to the minimally invasive procedure. Recently, techniques have been proposed for active canceling the beating heart motion for improving the accuracy of the surgical gestures. In this scenario, computer vision techniques can be applied for estimating the heart motion based solely on natural structures on the heart surface. However, visual tracking is complicated by the particular lighting conditions and clutter (smoke, liquids, etc) during surgery. Another challenging problem are the occasional occlusions by surgical instruments. In order to overcome these problems, we exploit the quasi-periodicity of the beating heart motion for increasing the robustness of the visual tracking task. In this paper, a novel time-varying dual Fourier series for modeling the quasi-periodic beating heart motion is proposed. For estimating the series parameters, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used. The proposed method is applied in a visual tracking task for bridging tracking disturbances and automatically reestablish tracking in cases of occlusions. The efficiency of the prediction method and the sensible improvements in the visual tracking task are demonstrated through in vivo experiments.",43
icra,None,Automation of tissue piercing using circular needles and vision guidance for computer aided laparoscopic surgery,"Christoph Staub,Takayuki Osa,Alois Knoll,Robert Bauernschmitt,","Despite the fact that minimally invasive robotic surgery provides many advantages for patients, such as reduced tissue trauma and shorter hospitalization, complex tasks (e.g. tissue piercing or knot-tying) are still time-consuming, error-prone and lead to quicker fatigue of the surgeon. Automating these recurrent tasks could greatly reduce total surgery time for patients and disburden the surgeon while he can focus on higher level challenges. This work tackles the problem of autonomous tissue piercing in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery with a circular needle and general purpose surgical instruments. To command the instruments to an incision point, the surgeon utilizes a laser pointer to indicate the stitching area. A precise positioning of the needle is obtained by means of a switching visual servoing approach and the subsequent stitch is performed in a circular motion.",71
icra,None,Visual sensing of continuum robot shape using self-organizing maps,"Jordan M. Croom,D. Caleb Rucker,Joseph M. Romano,Robert J. Webster,","Shape control of continuum robots requires a means of sensing the the curved shape of the robot. Since continuum robots are deformable, they take on shapes that are general curves in space, which are not fully defined by actuator positions. Vision-based shape-estimation provides a promising avenue for shape-sensing. While this is often facilitated by fiducial markers, sometimes fiducials are not feasible due to either the robot's application or its size. To address this, we present a robust and efficient stereo-vision-based, shape-sensing algorithm for continuum robots that does not rely on fiducials or assume orthogonal camera placement. The algorithm employs self-organizing maps to triangulate three-dimensional backbone curves. Experiments with an object with a known shape demonstrate an average accuracy of 1.53 mm on a 239 mm arc length curve.",68
icra,None,Visual vein-finding for robotic IV insertion,"Reuben D. Brewer,J. Kenneth Salisbury,","This paper presents a new algorithm for selecting the optimal needle insertion point in images of hand veins for robotic IV insertion. The 3D coordinates and orientation of the vein that the algorithm detects would eventually be fed to a robot for insertion of the IV needle. The goal of the algorithm is to identify venous bifurcations and determine an insertion point and approach angle for the needle in between their branches. The algorithm uses an annular tracking window that tracks along the veins and searches for bifurcations. We describe methods for centering the initial bifurcation estimates, error-checking, and positioning the needle exactly in between the bifurcation branches. We conclude with an experimental study of 50 subjects that shows a 32.4% success rate at detecting all bifurcations and a 82.6% success rate at finding at least one bifurcation in each image that contains bifurcations.",17

This work is motivated by common tasks executed by our underwater vehicles, although we illustrate a mode of interaction that is applicable to mobile robotics in general. The key aspect of our approach is to provide an intuitive linkage between the graphical visualization of regions of interest in the environment, and activities relevant to these regions. In addition to introducing this novel programming paradigm, we also describe the associated system architecture developed on-board our amphibious robot. We then present a user interaction study that illustrates the benefits in usability of our graphical interface, compared to conventionally established programming techniques.",5
icra,None,"Flexible, adaptable utility components for component-based robot software","Geoffrey Biggs,","Component-based software design is a current trend, both in general software practice and in robot software practice. It brings benefits to the field of robot programming. Component interfaces are fixed at design time and form a contract with other components, guaranteeing functionality. Known interfaces are typically important to reusability. However, in certain cases fixed interfaces can limit the reusability of components. Utility components provide general functionality that is reused a large number of times both within a single software system and between systems. They need to be adapted to the interfaces for each specific use case. This paper presents a set of utility components that can adapt their interfaces to the user's needs without any code changes. Dynamic programming language techniques are used to provide the adaptability. The components are a great benefit to the reusability of common utility components, removing a common cause of reinvention.",12
icra,None,Applying regression testing to software for robot hardware interaction,"Geoffrey Biggs,","If robots are to be fully accepted in the homes and offices of the world, it is important that they are guaranteed to be reliable and not to cause damage or harm. This requires testing robot systems and the software that comprises them. But testing robot software has always been a difficult process for developers. Issues of repeatability, safety, access to hardware and the general complexity of robot software are encountered. In industrial robotics, these difficulties are mitigated somewhat by the relatively simple, repeatable tasks and the controlled environment. Robotics for real-world environments, on the other hand, face the full challenges of testing. In this paper, we discuss regression testing at a low level of individual software components, particularly those components that are designed to interface with robot hardware. We present a software system for regression testing these components in a fully repeatable fashion as a case study of performing such testing in robotics. The presented system provides an efficient and quick method to monitor changes in the behaviour of software components as they are developed. Developers of robot software can quickly discover undesired changes and correct them.",9
icra,None,GenoM3: Building middleware-independent robotic components,"Anthony Mallet,Cédric Pasteur,Matthieu Herrb,Séverin Lemaignan,,","The topic of reusable software in robotics is now largely addressed. Components based architectures, where components are independent units that can be reused accross applications, have become more popular. As a consequence, a long list of middlewares and integration tools is available in the community, often in the form of open-source projects. However, these projects are generally self contained with little reuse between them. This paper presents a software engineering approach that intends to grant middleware independance to robotic software components so that a clear separation of concerns is achieved between highly reusable algorithmic parts and integration frameworks. Such a decoupling let middle-wares be used interchangeably, while fully benefitting from their specific, individual features.

Roman,Jorge Villatoro,,","Over the last five years, a number of powerful robotics controllers have become available. Only a small percentage of these are suitable for general use in robotics. In particular, they trivially interface with a large variety of sensors and effectors, have a well constructed software IDE that works with a standard programming language, are self contained and are easy to use. The CBC2 is a new robot controller that meets these conditions. The CBC2 includes an ARM 7 based DAQ/Motor control system, an ARM 9-based CPU/Vision processor running LINUX, an integrated color display and touch screen. The CBC2 is both a USB host (allowing the use of standard cameras, mass storage and network interfaces) and a USB device for software downloads. This paper describes the CBC2, its capabilities and the KISS-C IDE and associated libraries which include functionality ranging from color tracking to PID motor control. The CBC/KISS-C system was adopted by the Botball Robotics Education program in 2009, and was used in about three hundred schools.

icra,None,A globally convergent observer for velocity estimation in robotic manipulators with uncertain dynamics,"Nima Lotfi,Mehrzad Namvar,",We present a method for global estimation of joint velocities in robot manipulators. A non-minimal model of a robotic manipulator is used to design an adaptive observer capable of handling uncertainties in robot dynamics. Dimension of the proposed observer is shown to be at least 3n where n stands for the manipulator degrees of freedom. This number is less than the dimension of most of existing globally convergent adaptive observers. Global asymptotic convergence of system state estimates to their true values is achieved under no persistency of excitation condition. Smoothness of the dynamics of the proposed observer allows its easy implementation in comparison with non-smooth observers. Simulation results illustrate low noise sensitivity of the proposed observer in comparison with non-smooth observers.,0

icra,None,FPGA-based adaptive friction compensation for precision control of harmonic drivers,"Wen-Hong Zhu,","FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) devices have emerged as a new type of reconfigurable high-performance computing hardware. Despite their successful applications in a variety of areas, FPGA devices are just about to find their way into the control systems. In this paper, a FPGA-based adaptive friction compensation scheme with a FPGA-based velocity estimator is reported for the first time. The FPGA device allows the LuGre friction model to be effectively implemented and updated at a clock rate. A parameter adaptation mechanism automatically accommodates the parameter uncertainties. To avert the need of having a division computation, which is extremely difficult if not impossible for a FPGA device to perform, a specially designed accumulator is used to create the velocity signal necessarily required for high-precision position tracking control. The developed technology is experimentally tested on a harmonic drive coupled with a brushless motor. The ratio of the maximum position tracking error to the maximum velocity reaches 0.00034 (s) - an unprecedented number in the precision control of harmonic drives.",10

One main challenge for realizing basketball robots is to stabilize periodic motions of the ball. This task is nontrivial due to the discrete-continuous nature of the corresponding dynamics. The ball can be only controlled during ball-manipulator contact and moves freely otherwise. We propose a manipulator equipped with a spring that gets compressed when the ball bounces against it. Hence, we can have continuous-time control over this underactuated Ball-Spring-Manipulator system until the spring releases its accumulated energy back to the ball. This paper illustrates a systematic way of planning such a modified dribbling motion, computing an analytical transverse linearization and achieving orbital stabilization.",7
icra,None,Improving the kinematic performance of the SCARA-Tau PKM,"Mats Isaksson,Torgny Brogårdh,Ivan Lundberg,Saeid Nahavandi,","One well acknowledged drawback of traditional parallel kinematic machines (PKMs) is that the ratio of accessible workspace to robot footprint is small for these structures. This is most likely a contributing reason why relatively few PKMs are used in industry today. The SCARA-Tau structure is a parallel robot concept designed with the explicit goal of overcoming this limitation and developing a PKM with a workspace similar to that of a serial type robot of the same size. This paper shows for the first time how a proposed variant of the SCARA-Tau PKM can improve the usability of this robot concept further by significantly reducing the dependence between tool platform position and orientation of the original concept. The inverse kinematics of the proposed variant is derived and a comparison is made between this structure and the original SCARA-Tau concept, both with respect to platform orientation changes and workspace.",23

A generic objective (fitness) function that gives optimum value at points where a manipulator reaches its limit is formulated. By finding these points using MPSO, the workspace boundary of a parallel manipulator can be constructed. To demonstrate the method, the mapping of the boundary of a Stewart platform workspace is presented. The generic objective function can be modified easily to include any number of parameters and constraints, and this allows the method to be adapted for solving the workspace boundary problem of other parallel manipulators.",6

Only the prismatic joint is actuated and the first revolute joint in the chain can be locked or released online. The introduction of these lockable joints allow the prismatic actuators to maneuver to approximate 6-DoF motions for the moving platform. An algorithm for generating these maneuvers is first described.

icra,None,A family of quadratically-solvable 5-SP̲U parallel robots,"Júlia Borràs,Federico Thomas,Carme Torras,","A 5-SPU robot with collinear universal joints is well suited to handling an axisymmetric tool, since it has 5 controllable DoFs and the remaining one is a free rotation around the tool. The kinematics of such a robot having also coplanar spherical joints has previously been studied as a rigid subassembly of a Stewart-Gough platform, it being denoted a line-plane component. It was shown that this component has 8 assembly modes corresponding to the roots of a bi-quartic polynomial. Here we identify a whole family of these 5-SPU robots having only 4 assembly modes, which are obtained by solving two quadratic equations. This family is defined by a simple proportionality constraint relating the coordinates of the base and platform attachments. A geometric interpretation of the architectural singularities of this type of robots in terms of conics is provided, which facilitates their avoidance at the design stage. Parallel singularities obey also a neat geometric structure, which permits deriving a cell decomposition of configuration space. Two practical features of these quadratically-solvable robots are the large maneuverability within each connected component and the fact that, for a fixed orientation of the tool, the singularity locus reduces to a plane.",14
icra,None,On the determination of cable characteristics for large dimension cable-driven parallel mechanisms,"Nicolas Riehl,Marc Gouttefarde,Cédric Baradat,Françis Pierrot,","Generally, the cables of a parallel cable-driven robot are considered to be massless and inextensible. These two characteristics cannot be neglected anymore for large dimension mechanisms in order to obtain good positioning accuracy. A well-known model which describes the profile of a cable under the action of its own weight allows us to take mass and elasticity into account. When designing a robot, and choosing actuator and cable characteristics, a calculation of maximal tension has to be done. However, because cable mass has a significant effect on cable tensions, a model including cable mass has to be included in the design step. This paper proposes two methods to determine the appropriate cable and hence the maximal tensions in the cables. Applied to a large dimension robot, taking cable mass into account is proved to be necessary in comparison with an equivalent method based on the massless cable modeling. In this paper, only moving platform static equilibria are considered (slow enough motions).",46
icra,None,Control of underactuated planar hexapedal pronking through a dynamically embedded SLIP monopod,"M. Mert Ankaralı,Uluc̣ Saranlı,Afṣar Saranlı,","Pronking (aka. stotting) is a gait in which all legs are used in synchrony, resulting in long flight phases and large jumping heights that may potentially be useful for mobile robots on rough terrain. Robotic instantiations of this gait suffer from severe pitch instability either due to underactuation, or the lack of sufficient feedback. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of this gait suggests that the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum Model (SLIP), a very successful predictive model for both natural and robotic runners, would be a good basis for more robust and maneuverable robotic pronking. In this paper, we describe how “template-based control”, a controller structure based on the embedding of a simple dynamical “template” within a more complex “anchor” system, can be used to achieve stable and controllable pronking for a planar, underactuated hexapod model. In this context, high-level control of the gait is regulated through speed and height commands to the SLIP template, while the embedding controller based on approximate inverse-dynamics and carefully designed passive dynamics ensures the stability of the remaining degrees of freedom. We show through extensive simulation experiments that unlike existing open-loop alternatives, the resulting control structure provides stability, explicit maneuverability and significant robustness against sensor and actuator noise.",8

Using a kinematic simulation, ranges of velocity commands that result in stable gait coordination are determined for both cases, the undamaged robot and the robot experiencing the loss of a single leg. The results give insight how to adjust the motion commands after the loss of a leg. Further, a simplified dynamic simulation is used to analyze the effect of leg loss on the walking stability. Heuristic measures like curvature and length of the traveled path, roll and pitch angles are employed to evaluate the walking stability and performance. Some methods like shifting the COG or stiffening the variably compliant joints are proposed and discussed with respect to their ability to improve the walking performance in case of leg loss.

icra,None,Pushing methods for working six-legged robots capable of locomotion and manipulation in three modes,"Kenji Inoue,Kanjiro Ooe,Suwoong Lee,","A working six-legged robot which can switch three modes for locomotion and manipulation was already developed. In its vertical four-leg two-arm mode, lower four legs are used for locomotion and upper two legs for manipulation with its body vertical to the ground. In order to expend capabilities of this robot, a method of pushing a large object in this mode is proposed. The robot holds the object using its upper two legs and body. The robot leans against the object and applies pushing force. Then it walks by moving the outer and inner pairs of the lower four legs alternately. Because of this symmetric walking, the robot can push the object with keeping lateral balance. It can apply large force owing to the effect of its body weight. Because holding the object firmly, the robot can push the object stably without falling down. For comparison, two methods are also analyzed. First the robot simply walks by tripod gait with its body touching the object. Second the robot pushes the object using its upper two legs and walks using its lower four legs in vertical four-leg two-arm mode. Then the merits of the proposed method are clarified.

icra,None,Autonomous Underwater Vehicle trajectory design coupled with predictive ocean models: A case study,"Ryan N. Smith,Arvind Pereira,Yi Chao,Peggy P. Li,David A. Caron,,,","Data collection using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is increasing in importance within the oceanographic research community. Contrary to traditional moored or static platforms, mobile sensors require intelligent planning strategies to maneuver through the ocean. However, the ability to navigate to high-value locations and collect data with specific scientific merit is worth the planning efforts. In this study, we examine the use of ocean model predictions to determine the locations to be visited by an AUV, and aid in planning the trajectory that the vehicle executes during the sampling mission. The objectives are: a) to provide near-real time, in situ measurements to a large-scale ocean model to increase the skill of future predictions, and b) to utilize ocean model predictions as a component in an end-to-end autonomous prediction and tasking system for aquatic, mobile sensor networks. We present an algorithm designed to generate paths for AUVs to track a dynamically evolving ocean feature utilizing ocean model predictions. This builds on previous work in this area by incorporating the predicted current velocities into the path planning to assist in solving the 3-D motion planning problem of steering an AUV between two selected locations. We present simulation results for tracking a fresh water plume by use of our algorithm. Additionally, we present experimental results from field trials that test the skill of the model used as well as the incorporation of the model predictions into an AUV trajectory planner.

To understand their ecology, we need to be able to bring back water samples from the `right' places and times for lab analysis. In doing so, we target hotspots representative of intense biogeochemical activity for such sampling. Our approach uses remote sensing data to detect such hotspots using ocean color as a proxy, and advectively projects these patches spatio-temporally using surface current data from HF Radar stations.

icra,None,Learning discriminative MspLBP features based on Ada-LDA for multi-class pattern classification,"Kwang Ho An,Myung Jin Chung,","This paper presents a novel approach for multi-class pattern classification - face detection and facial expression recognition, which is based on discriminative multi-scale and multi-position Local Binary Pattern (MspLBP) features selected by a boosting technique called the AdaBoost+LDA (Ada-LDA) method. From a large pool of MspLBP features within a face image, the most discriminative MspLBP features trained by two alternative LDA methods depending on the singularity of the within-class scatter matrix, are selected under the framework of AdaBoost. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we performed two extensive experiments on the famous face databases in terms of face detection and facial expression recognition. First, face detection, a typical example of two-class pattern classification, was carried out on the MIT-CBCL and MIT+CMU face test sets. Second, facial expression recognition, a typical problem of multi-class pattern classification, was performed on the JAFFE face database. Given the same number of features, the proposed face detector shows over 25% higher detection rate than the well-known Viola's detector at a given false positive rate of 10%. It can also provide real-time operation with over 10 frames per second rate. For facial expression recognition, our approach also shows a better performance over at least 21% recognition rates than other linear subspace-based methods such as PCA, DCV, and PCA+LDA.

Safety, i.e., proving that a potentially dangerous configuration is never reached in the control system, usually competes with effectiveness, i.e., ensuring that tasks are performed at an acceptable level of quality. In particular, we focus on a robot playing the air hockey game against a human opponent, where the robot has to learn how to minimize opponent's goals (defense play). This setup is paradigmatic since the robot must see, decide and move fastly, but, at the same time, it must learn and guarantee that the control system is safe throughout the process. We attack this problem using automata-theoretic formalisms and associated verification tools, showing experimentally that our approach can yield safety without heavily compromising effectiveness.",11
icra,None,Activation of a mobile robot through a brain computer interface,"Alexandre O. G. Barbosa,David R. Achanccaray,Marco A. Meggiolaro,","This work presents the development of a brain computer interface as an alternative communication channel to be used in Robotics. It encompasses the implementation of an electroencephalograph (EEG), as well as the development of all computational methods and necessary techniques to identify mental activities. The developed brain computer interface (BCI) is applied to activate the movements of a 120lb mobile robot, associating four different mental activities to robot commands. The interface is based on EEG signal analyses, which extract features that can be classified as specific mental activities. First, a signal preprocessing is performed from the EEG data, filtering noise, using a spatial filter to increase the scalp signal resolution, and extracting relevant features. Then, different classifier models are proposed, evaluated and compared. At last, two implementations of the developed classifiers are proposed to improve the rate of successful commands to the mobile robot. In one of the implementations, a 91% average hit rate is obtained, with only 1.25% wrong commands after 400 attempts to control the mobile robot.",88
icra,None,Robot reinforcement learning using EEG-based reward signals,"I. Iturrate,L. Montesano,J. Minguez,","Reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully applied in robotics to learn how to solve tasks based on reward signals obtained during task execution. These reward signals are usually modeled by the programmer or provided by supervision. However, there are situations in which this reward is hard to encode, and so would require a supervised approach of reinforcement learning, where a user directly types the reward on each trial. This paper proposes to use brain activity recorded by an EEG-based BCI system as reward signals. The idea is to obtain the reward from the activity generated while observing the robot solving the task. This process does not require an explicit model of the reward signal. Moreover, it is possible to capture subjective aspects which are specific to each user. To achieve this, we designed a new protocol to use brain activity related to the correct or wrong execution of the task. We showed that it is possible to detect and classify different levels of error in single trials. We also showed that it is possible to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to learn new similar tasks using the rewards obtained from brain activity.",91

To develop a robot audition system, we integrated SSL module and MWF module into a DSP system. SSL is a module to perceive the direction of a human user's call. It measures time delay of arrival among microphones and estimates the direction of sound source. Also, it post-processes the resulted estimations of direction by histogram to perceive the direction robustly under noisy environment. MWF is a module to reduce background noises from raw voice signal to enhance the performance of robot's speech recognition. It gathers information of background noises during noise-period and then reduces noises during voice-period. This SSL-MWF combination system will be a cheap, high-performing and convenient solution for robot audition.",5
icra,None,Characterization of the electrical resistance of carbon-black-filled silicone: Application to a flexible and stretchable robot skin,"Marc-Antoine Lacasse,Vincent Duchaine,Clément Gosselin,","Providing robots with the capability of sensing their surrounding environment is an important feature that would lead to a more intuitive and safe physical human-robot interaction. This paper proposes a new design of homogeneous flexible and stretchable robot skin based on carbon-black-filled (CBF) silicone and conductive fabric that can sense multiple contact locations as well as applied pressure. CBF silicone has been already used in sensing technology but its piezoresistivity is still largely misunderstood. This particular behavior is investigated in this paper through a set of experiments conducted on isolated sensing cells. Using the results of these experiments, a model describing the variation of the resistivity in the CBF silicone as a function of the applied pressure is proposed. Based on this model, a simple way to accurately estimate the applied pressure in real time is demonstrated. Finally, using this improved knowledge of the behaviour of the CBF silicone, the fabrication of a fully functional sensor array is presented. The proposed design has the particularity of circumventing the well-known problem of cross-talk between sensing cells.",71

This problem has not received much attention in literature because of the lack of large-scale skin sensor systems. The proposed approach is based on a controlled compliance motion with respect to external objects whose pose is known, which allows a robot to determine the location of its own taxels. The major contribution of this work is the formulation of the skin calibration problem as a maximum-likelihood mapping problem in a 6D space, where both the position and the orientation of each taxel are recovered. An effective calibration process is envisaged that, given a compliance control law that assures prolonged contact maintenance between a given body part and an external object, returns a maximum-likelihood estimate of detected taxel poses. Simulations validate the approach.",40

We have proposed active tactile sensing method using balloon expansion. A balloon is contacted with an object and expanded by using fluid. Tactile information is evaluated by measuring the expansion process. In this paper, we developed a sensor system using syringe. It is a compact system and can ensure enough safety for human body tissues in safe contact, using no electric power, and sterilization. Pressure changes and volume changes of the balloon can be measured together in the balloon expansion. First, overview of the developed sensor system is presented. Next, composition of the sensor system and the sensing process are presented. Then, experiments using the developed sensor are conducted on samples with different stiffness and surface conditions.

In previous research, we developed a flexible, thin and lightweight slip sensor that exploits the characteristics of pressure conductive rubber. However, using this sensor, it was difficult to distinguish between object slip and a change in the normal force. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated a method for identifying object slip by analyzing the frequency components of the output signal from the sensor. As a result, we found that high-frequency components of 1 kHz or more are included in the complex voltage signal generated by object slip. Therefore, by using this high-frequency component, we developed a simple sensor that distinguished between both contact and initial slip with high sensitivity.",45
icra,None,Learning visibility of landmarks for vision-based localization,"Pablo F. Alcantarilla,Sang Min Oh,Gian Luca Mariottini,Luis M. Bergasa,,","We aim to perform robust and fast vision-based localization using a pre-existing large map of the scene. A key step in localization is associating the features extracted from the image with the map elements at the current location. Although the problem of data association has greatly benefited from recent advances in appearance-based matching methods, less attention has been paid to the effective use of the geometric relations between the 3D map and the camera in the matching process. In this paper we propose to exploit the geometric relationship between the 3D map and the camera pose to determine the visibility of the features. In our approach, we model the visibility of every map feature with respect to the camera pose using a non-parametric distribution model. We learn these non-parametric distributions during the 3D reconstruction process, and develop efficient algorithms to predict the visibility of features during localization. With this approach, the matching process only uses those map features with the highest visibility score, yielding a much faster algorithm and superior localization results. We demonstrate an integrated system based on the proposed idea and highlight its potential benefits for the localization in large and cluttered environments.",25
icra,None,Explicit coordinated localization using common visual objects,"J.M. Peula,J. Cebolla,C. Urdiales,F. Sandoval,","Localization in multi-robot systems is a key problem in multi agent systems. In many cases, specially involving legged robots, like the Robocup soccer competition, it relies on predefined landmarks at known locations. However, when several objects are in motion, vision occlusions due to agents in the field of view make this kind of localization unfeasible for mild time periods. This also happens if landmarks are not within the field of view. This paper presents a technique to let a robot estimate its position with respect to objects or robots by sharing whatever visual data it has with its teammates. Shared data is used to estimate the relative positions of robots watching the same object via stereoscopy. The rest of the robots can be localized via triangulation and acquire information on the position of hidden or unknown objects that other members of the team can see. The system has been tested with two Aibo ERS 7 robots from Sony and an Aiball.",3
icra,None,Improving indoor navigation of autonomous robots by an explicit representation of doors,"Matthias Nieuwenhuisen,Jörg Stückler,Sven Behnke,","In the last decades, tremendous progress has been made in the field of autonomous indoor navigation for mobile robots. However, these approaches assume the structural part of the environment to be completely static. In practice, movable parts of scenes, e.g. doors, frequently violate this assumption which leads to poor performance. Also, mobile manipulation capabilities can only be utilized, if the robot knows about the movability of objects. In this paper, we address an important part of these problems by the explicit representation of doors as door leaves and joints. We propose to augment standard approaches to navigation like 2D occupancy grid mapping and Monte-Carlo-Localization. Our algorithm detects doors during mapping and represents their movability adequately in the map. During localization, the state of doors is estimated from measurements while it is simultaneously used to improve localization robustness and accuracy. In experimental results we demonstrate superior performance of our method compared to a state-of-the-art approach to localization.",13

We consider the problem of using on-board vision to determine a vehicle's pose in a known, but non-static, environment. While feasible technologies exist for vehicle localization, many are not suited for industrial settings where the vehicle must operate dependably both indoors and outdoors and in a range of lighting conditions. We extend the capabilities of an existing vision-based localization system, in a continued effort to improve the robustness, reliability and utility of an automated industrial vehicle system. The vehicle pose is estimated by comparing an edge-filtered version of a video stream to an available 3D edge map of the site. We enhance the previous system by additionally filtering the camera input for straight lines using a Hough transform, observing that the 3D environment map contains only linear features. In addition, we present an automated approach for generating 3D edge maps from laser point clouds, removing the need for manual map surveying and also reducing the time for map generation down from days to minutes. We present extensive localization results in multiple lighting conditions comparing the system with and without the proposed enhancements.",33

Using the position/orientation of the rover body and all the joint angles as generalized coordinates, the Jacobian matrices and recursive dynamic models are derived. Terramechanics models for calculating the forces and moments that act on the wheel-as a result of the deformable soil-are introduced in consideration of the effect of normal force. A rough terrain modeling method is developed for estimating the wheel-soil interaction area, wheel sinkage, and the terminal coordinate. A simulation program that includes the above techniques is developed using Matlab and SpaceDyn Toolbox.

icra,None,Pushing motion control of n passive off-hooked trailers by a car-like mobile robot,"Kwanghyun Yoo,Woojin Chung,","There are two different motions of a trailer system that consists of a car and n passive off-hooked trailers. When a car “pulls” n passive trailers, a trailer system moves forward. A trailer system moves backward when a car “pushes” n passive trailers. Backing up a trailer system is difficult because it is an open loop unstable problem. In this paper, we investigate the backward motion control problem of a car with n passive trailers. We have shown that n passive trailers can be successfully controlled by an omni-directional mobile robot in our prior works. Unlike an omni-directional robot, a car-like mobile robot has nonholonomic constraints and limitations of the steering angle. For these reasons, the backward motion control problem of a car-like mobile robot with n passive trailers is not trivial. In spite of difficulties, backing up a trailer system is useful for parking control. In this study, we proposed a mechanical alteration which is connecting n passive trailers to the front bumper of a car to improve the backward motion control performance. By adopting the new design, a car pushes n passive trailers by its forward motion. A practical trailer-pushing control algorithm was also proposed. Stability analysis of the controller under kinematic modeling error was presented. Theoretical verification and experimental results proved that the control strategy of pushing n passive trailers by forward motion of a car can be successfully implemented.",21

A novel approach based on the redundant actuated wheels is proposed to identify the status of the vehicle and the wheel slip ratio by only observing the velocity feedback from motors encoders. A dynamic model considering the wheel-ground interaction is described. Based on the slip ratio of the wheel joints and the null space of the operational space, control strategies are employed to redistribute the torques applied to the wheel joints so that each wheel can be self-adapted to meet a complex wheel-ground condition to eliminate slippage with high rate. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed estimation approach and the performance of the torque distribution schemes.",5

Classical pursuit evasion problem, such as the Homicidal Chauffeur problem, considers the kinematic model of the pursuer and does not consider slip in its trajectory, and thus cannot predict a realistic pursuit evasion scenario. In this work we present a new dynamics-based approach to pursuit evasion problem in the presence of wheel slip. We first show how a feedback linearization controller can achieve capture with wheel slip. We then improve the capture time by designing a new extremum seeking controller that maximizes lateral traction force to effect a sharper but stable turn. The simulation results show the efficacy of our proposed control approach.",7

Based on this algorithm, all agents can form a network and maintain connectivity. This is of great advantage for agents to exchange information. In addition, collision avoidance among agents is guaranteed in the whole process of target tracking.

In particular, we show that the displacement and the relative orientation of each follower with respect to the leader's reference frame are fixed if and only if the robots either move along circular paths or parallel straight lines. These equilibrium configurations always exist if the trajectory of the leader is a circle of sufficiently small curvature or a straight line.",3

Modules of the system are independently mobile and can be driven on flat surfaces in a similar fashion to the classic kinematic cart. This problem differs from most nonholonomic steering problems because of an added constraint on one of the internal states. The constraint properly aligns the docking mechanism, allowing modules to connect with one another along wheel surfaces.

The proposed approach, Sampling-based Motion and Symbolic Action Planner (SMAP), leverages from sampling-based motion planning the underlying idea of searching for a solution trajectory by selectively sampling and exploring the continuous space of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Drawing from AI, SMAP uses symbolic action planning to identify actions and regions of the continuous space that sampling-based motion planning can further explore to significantly advance the search. The planning layers interact with each-other through estimates on the utility of each action, which are computed based on information gathered during the search.

The system dynamics is simplified to a planar two-link robot with actuation only at the shoulder joint and a passive spring at the elbow joint representing the stiffness of the arm. The objective is to accelerate the ball from an initial configuration at rest in such a way that the projection of its velocity along a certain elevation angle is maximal at a predefined release line. The suggested procedure makes use of a parameterization of the robot motion in terms of geometric relations among the generalized coordinates. We systematically formulate a necessary condition for an optimal motion resulting in a nonlinear differential equation that describes a synchronization of the joint angles. A suitable solution is found by numerically searching over a finite number of free initial conditions.,21

icra,None,A quadratic regulator-based heuristic for rapidly exploring state space,"Elena Glassman,Russ Tedrake,","Kinodynamic planning algorithms like Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees (RRTs) hold the promise of finding feasible trajectories for rich dynamical systems with complex, nonconvex constraints. In practice, these algorithms perform very well on configuration space planning, but struggle to grow efficiently in systems with dynamics or differential constraints. This is due in part to the fact that the conventional distance metric, Euclidean distance, does not take into account system dynamics and constraints when identifying which node in the existing tree is capable of producing children closest to a given point in state space. We show that an affine quadratic regulator (AQR) design can be used to approximate the exact minimum-time distance pseudometric at a reasonable computational cost. We demonstrate improved exploration of the state spaces of the double integrator and simple pendulum when using this pseudometric within the RRT framework, but this improvement drops off as systems' nonlinearity and complexity increase.

We segment input range data by superpixel segmentation and extract features for each segment. We search for a group of segments where each segment matches a segment in another group using a joint compatibility test. The discovered objects are then verified by the Iterative Closest Point algorithm to remove false matches. The presented method was tested on real data of complex objects.

icra,None,Self-supervised cross-modal online learning of basic object affordances for developmental robotic systems,"Barry Ridge,Danijel Skočaj,Aleš Leonardis,","For a developmental robotic system to function successfully in the real world, it is important that it be able to form its own internal representations of affordance classes based on observable regularities in sensory data. Usually successful classifiers are built using labeled training data, but it is not always realistic to assume that labels are available in a developmental robotics setting. There does, however, exist an advantage in this setting that can help circumvent the absence of labels: co-occurrence of correlated data across separate sensory modalities over time. The main contribution of this paper is an online classifier training algorithm based on Kohonen's learning vector quantization (LVQ) that, by taking advantage of this co-occurrence information, does not require labels during training, either dynamically generated or otherwise. We evaluate the algorithm in experiments involving a robotic arm that interacts with various household objects on a table surface where camera systems extract features for two separate visual modalities.

In this paper, we extend their method to accommodate grasps with multiple contacts. This approach works well for many human-made objects because it models the way we grasp objects.

Such models are crucial for analyzing and estimating signals in the nervous system. In this paper, we focus on signal transmission delay of the somatosensory reflex loop and investigate its relationship with the generalization capability of the reflex model. We obtain some sets of model parameters assuming different time delays using the data obtained from a stepping motion, and perform cross validations against stepping motions with different cycles as well as entirely different behaviors such as squat and jump. Interestingly, time delays close to the value expected from physiological properties show better cross-validation results than others. This result suggests that relatively simple reflex control can be generalized to multiple behaviors if the parameters are appropriate, and that robust control is possible even with large feedback delay.",7

The speed estimation method worked well across treadmill speeds yielding a root mean square speed estimation error of only 8%. This accuracy is comparable to that achieved from shank-mounted inertial measurement unit, providing a robust and low-cost alternative in using accelerometer for walking speed estimation. Shank-mounted accelerometer may be of great benefit for estimating speed in walking for the embedded control of knee-mounted devices such as prostheses and energy harvesters.",35
icra,None,Human motion patterns from single camera cues for medical applications,"Evan Ribnick,Vassilios Morellas,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","Physical constraints that underly the formation of periodic motions can be effectively used to accurately reconstruct the periodic motion from even single camera views. As shown in our earlier work, this reduces to a problem of geometric inference. In this paper, we focus on periodic motions exhibited by humans, which are generally not perfectly periodic, and explore the suitability of the reconstruction techniques in these scenarios. We examine the degree of periodicity of human gait empirically, including the applicability of our motion model. Importantly, we illustrate the usefulness of these techniques by applying them to the task of clinical gait analysis. A computational tool to analyze periodic human motion can prove to be invaluable in medical applications either in terms of assessing deviations from normal patterns or evaluating changes resulting from therapy or other clinical procedures.",1
icra,None,A dipole field for object delivery by pushing on a flat surface,"Takeo Igarashi,Youichi Kamiyama,Masahiko Inami,","This paper introduces a simple algorithm for non-prehensile object transportation by a pushing robot on a flat surface. We assume that the global position and orientation of the robot and objects are known. The system computes a dipole field around the object and moves the robot along the field. This simple algorithm resolves many subtle issues in implementing reliable pushing behaviors, such as collision avoidance, error recovery, and multi-robot coordination. We verify the effectiveness of the algorithm via several experiments with varying robot and object form factors. Although object delivery by pushing and motion control by a vector field are not new, the proposed algorithm offers easier implementation with fewer parameter adjustments because of its mode-less definition and scale-invariant formulation.",36
icra,None,Active shaping of an unknown rheological object based on deformation decomposition into elasticity and plasticity,"Mitsuru Higashimori,Kayo Yoshimoto,Makoto Kaneko,","This paper discusses an active shaping method for an unknown rheological object by considering the characteristics of viscoelasticity. By utilizing a four-element model for approximating the dynamic characteristics of object's deformation, we drive the deformation decomposition into the elastic response and the plastic one. For shaping the object, we then propose a two-phase strategy for controlling the resultant deformation; in the first phase the viscoelastic parameters are estimated with avoiding the over deformation, based on the elastic response; in the second phase the desired resultant deformation is generated by actively managing the integral force, based on the plastic response. This strategy has an advance that the handling time of the robot is given by a finite time, while the desired resultant deformation is theoretically completed in the infinite time. We finally show experimental results for confirming the validity of the proposed strategy.",47
icra,None,Avoiding Zeno's paradox in impulse-based rigid body simulation,"Evan Drumwright,","Treating “resting” contacts (i.e., contacts with zero normal relative velocity), using forces is problematic due to inconsistent configurations. For this reason, treating resting contacts with impulses instead of forces has become common, but this approach also suffers from a significant problem: applying impulses at the time-of-contact can keep the simulation from advancing. This scenario is analogous to one of the paradoxes devised by the philosopher Zeno, and has been referred to as a Zeno point in the simulation community. I describe how to avoid Zeno points without violating the theoretical dynamic behavior of the simulated bodies and without permitting interpenetration. Two experiments demonstrate that the method works as desired where alternative approaches that required accepting interpenetration or longer running times were previously required.",5
icra,None,Deformable robot motion planning in a reduced-dimension configuration space,"Arthur Mahoney,Joshua Bross,David Johnson,","Motion planning of deformable objects is challenging due to the high degrees-of-freedom inherent in deformation as well as the computational cost of producing physically accurate deformations. This paper develops a method for fast, physically plausible deformations using a sampling-based planner in a reduced dimensionality configuration space containing position, orientation, and a reduced deformation space produced using principal component analysis. A key element of the presented approach is the use of energy constraints in the configuration space designed to remove implausible deformations that may be produced by the principal component analysis dimension reduction process. This approach is tested on several deforming robot planning tasks, such as a sphere fitting through slots, a bendable bar in a maze, and a deforming plate in tunnels, with collision free paths using plausible deformations found in a few minutes.",23
icra,None,An efficient algorithm for self-reconfiguration planning in a modular robot,"Tom Larkworthy,Subramanian Ramamoorthy,","An efficient planning algorithm for the hexagonal metamorphic self-reconfiguring system (SRS) is presented. Empirically, the algorithm achieves an time complexity of O(n) averaged over random problem instances. The planning algorithm is capable of solving approximately 97% of planning tasks in the general state space of configurations containing less than 20,000 units. The state space is divided into two classes according to planning efficiency. The configurations belonging to the first class permit an Euler tour to be wrapped around the robotic aggregate. The existence of the Euler tour implies units are free to move around the perimeter of the SRS. Planning between configurations in this class can be performed in O(n) using a specialized planning algorithm. The set of Euler tour configurations span a large volume of the general state space of the hexagonal SRS. A second specialized planning algorithm plans from a general configuration to a nearby Euler tour configuration. While planning in the general configuration state space is computationally harder, the distance required to plan is short. Thus, the combination of both algorithms allows us to efficiently plan for a large proportion of possible reconfiguration tasks for the hexagonal metamorphic robot.",28
icra,None,Reach then see: A new adaptive controller for robot manipulator based on dual task-space information,"C.C. Cheah,X. Li,","It is interesting to observe from human visually guided tasks that visual feedback is not used for the entire movement, but only at end phases when our hand is near the target. We are able to move our hand from an initial position that is not within our field of view and transit smoothly and easily into visual feedback when the target is near. Inspired by this natural action, this paper presents a new task-space adaptive controller with dual feedback information. The proposed controller consists of a Cartesian-space region reaching controller at the initial stage and a vision based tracking controller that is only activated when the end effector enters an image region. A new potential energy function is proposed such that the image region can be fixed as the field of view of the camera and does not have to vary with the desired trajectory. The proposed task-space controller can transit smoothly from Cartesian-space reaching to vision-space tracking control. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed with consideration of the nonlinear dynamics. The proposed adaptive controller is implemented on an industrial robot and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",7
icra,None,"Spring assisted modular and reconfigurable robot: Design, analysis and control","Guangjun Liu,Yugang Liu,","This paper presents an innovative spring assisted modular and reconfigurable robot (MRR) design and control framework, which is developed based on a synergetic integration of robot control with a brake and an embedded spring at each modular joint. By activating the brake, static balancing can be established, allowing reinforced delicate operation in the neighborhood of a balanced configuration such as door opening, as well as spring assisted lift of heavy payload. The developed spring assisted MRR can improve the payload to weight ratio of the conventional robot manipulators without introducing sophisticated mechanisms. A distributed control method has been proposed to facilitate control of the spring assisted MRR. The developed control algorithm does not rely on a prior dynamic models and can suppress uncertainties introduced by module reconfigurations as well as uncertainties due to sensor inaccuracies and noises. With the developed controller, control parameters need not to be adjusted when adding modules to or removing modules from an MRR, or changing its configurations. Prototype modules have been developed, and the experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed design and control.",4

The size of the foot mechanism is 160 mm × 277 mm and its weight is 1.5 kg. The foot system consists of four spikes each of which has an optical sensor to detect ground height. The foot makes a support polygon on uneven terrain by using three or four spikes. We have conducted several experiments on the outdoor ground surface that has a slope of 7.0 degrees and a maximum height of 15 mm bumps, and the effectiveness of the foot mechanism is confirmed.",48
icra,None,Improving stability and performance of digitally controlled systems: The concept of Modified Holds,"Kamran Ghaffari Toiserkan,József Kövecses,","Digitally controlled systems are getting more and more popular mainly because of their flexibility and convenience but their stability is strongly affected by the time delay introduced by different factors. For common PID type digital controllers, zero-order holds (ZOHs) are commonly employed and the stability characteristics are investigated based on that concept. Mathematical investigations show that higher-order holds may improve the stability and performance of the system and can reduce the steady state errors significantly. This is because the controller tries to learn from the history of the behavior of the system and then predict the behavior for the time period between sampling instances and generate the best possible control force. Furthermore, a new concept of Modified Holds is introduced, which clearly improves the performance of a digital controller. For most control algorithms this does not prolong the processing time significantly (e.g. less than 1%) which can be neglected in the calculations. The varying control force would need an analogue circuitry to follow the proper curve, which might make the controller's electronic circuits more complex. This can be avoided considering that in almost all digital controllers the main core operates at several orders of magnitude higher frequency than that of the control loop itself. Hence, the control force can also be generated digitally at much higher frequencies. In this paper, after investigating the stability of a 1-DoF system equipped with discrete-time PD controller with first and second order holds, the concept of modified holds is introduced and then the results are validated by simulations. Furthermore, the concept is practically implemented on a self-balancing motor bike robot and the experimental results further support the claims of the paper.",6
icra,None,Adaptive admittance control of a robot manipulator under task space constraint,"Keng Peng Tee,Rui Yan,Haizhou Li,","We present adaptive admittance control of a robotic manipulator, with uncertain dynamic parameters, operating in a constrained task space. To provide compliance to external forces, we generate a differentiable reference trajectory that remains in the constrained task space. Then, adaptive backstepping control, based on a time-varying asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF), is designed to achieve tracking of the reference trajectory while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction. The improved BLF-based control renders the entire constrained task space positively invariant. Despite transient perturbations by external forces and online parameter adaptation, practical tracking of the reference trajectory is achieved without transgression of the constrained task space. In the absence of interaction forces, asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectory is achieved.",78
icra,None,Stabilizing a vehicle near rollover: An analogy to cart-pole stabilization,"Steven C. Peters,James E. Bobrow,Karl Iagnemma,",An analogy between the dynamics of a cart-pole system and vehicle rollover dynamics is used to derive a controller for tipping up and stabilizing a planar model of a passenger vehicle near rollover by controlling lateral tire friction forces. The controller is based on a previously published controller for stabilizing a cart-pole using partial feedback linearization and energy shaping. A necessary condition for tip-up is given based on the surface friction coefficient and the location of the vehicle center of gravity (c.g.). A multi-body vehicle model with suspension is presented in the form of the robotic manipulator equations. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the effect of friction and suspension properties on the tip-up problem.,26
icra,None,Differentially flat mobile manipulators mounted with an under-actuated vertical arm,"Ji-Chul Ryu,Sunil K. Agrawal,","This paper discusses how mobile manipulators with an under-actuated vertical arm can be designed to be differentially flat. The property of differential flatness is achieved by appropriate inertia redistribution of the vertical arm and a wide range of under-actuation becomes possible. As a result of having the flatness property, the under-actuated mobile manipulators are capable of executing point-to-point maneuvers as mobile manipulators with a fully actuated arm would do. In addition, the trajectory planning and feedback controller design for point-to-point motions in state space is considerably simplified despite the under-actuation of the arm and nonholonomic constraints (from no-slip assumption) of the mobile base, which make the system more difficult to plan and control. These ideas are demonstrated through an illustrative example of a mobile manipulator consisting of an under-actuated vertical three-link arm and a two-wheeled differentially driven mobile base using differential flatness.",0
icra,None,Design and analysis of a soft mobile robot composed of multiple thermally activated joints driven by a single actuator,"Nadia Cheng,Genya Ishigami,Stephan Hawthorne,Hao Chen,Malik Hansen,,,,","Soft robotic systems have applications in industrial, medical, and security applications. Many applications require these robots to be small and lightweight. One challenge in developing a soft robotic system is to drive multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOF) with few actuators, thereby reducing system size and weight. This paper presents the analysis and design of an inchworm-like mobile robot that consists of multiple, independent thermally activated joints but is driven by a single actuator. To realize control of this under-actuated system, a solder-based locking mechanism has been developed to selectively activate individual joints without requiring additional actuators. The design and performance analysis of a prototype mobile robot that is capable of inchworm-like translational and steering motion is described. The design of novel “feet” with anisotropic friction properties is also described.",87
icra,None,The effect of dynamic singularities on robotic control and design,"Bill Goodwine,Jason Nightingale,","This paper presents the definition of a new type of dynamic singularity for robotic manipulators. It is applicable to all underactuated robotic systems that can be described by Lagrange's equations where the Lagrangian is the kinetic minus potential energy. The approach is to decompose the velocity at every point in the configuration space into velocity directions that can be directly controlled and those that are uncontrolled and orthogonal to the directly controlled directions. These uncontrolled directions are controlled only through the dynamic coupling with the controlled directions and the measure of a dynamic singularity is then a measure of this degree of coupling. When this coupling is zero, the mechanism is said to be at a dynamic singularity. The practical implication is that, at such points, the dynamics are decoupled and control over the uncontrolled directions is very weak in that the mechanism will have to move away from the singularity before the inputs can affect the uncontrolled velocity directions. An example that is realistically complicated is presented and simulations show the effect on control inputs when the system is operating near a dynamic singularity.",15
icra,None,Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum embedding: Extensions toward the control of compliant running robots,"Ioannis Poulakakis,","This paper explores systematic control strategies for the stabilization of running on compliant robots with nontrivial torso pitch dynamics. The Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) embedding controller is revisited and its pertinence to more general legged robot models is investigated. It is first deduced that - in the context of an asymmetric hopper - the existence of a SLIP embedding control law requires nominal running motions in which the torso is kept at a constant angle. To remove this overly restrictive condition, a new method is proposed here that retains the advantage of generating control inputs acting in concert with the compliant dynamics of the plant without explicit reliance on the SLIP. To illustrate the enhanced control authority afforded by the proposed method, a minimalist setting is considered, in which a three-degree-of-freedom asymmetric hopper is controlled by a single actuator located at the hip.",20
icra,None,Passive dynamic walking with quadrupeds - Extensions towards 3D,"C. David Remy,Marco Hutter,Roland Siegwart,","In the present study, we applied the principles of passive dynamic walking onto the three dimensional motion of a simplified quadrupedal model. We extended the simulation framework of a planar system to include a rolling degree of freedom and searched for limit cycles that represent periodic gaits. Among the eight different gaits that we identified, were three kinds of trots and paces, as well as a lateral and diagonal single foot sequence. We could show that a distinct relation exists between the lateral spacing of the legs and the relative phase of the front and the back legs, and a certain trade-off between efficiency and dynamic stability. In agreement with established bipedal models, our results showed that the lateral rolling motion is invariably unstable.",16
icra,None,A two-dimensional passive dynamic running biped with knees,"Dai Owaki,Masatoshi Koyama,Shin'ichi Yamaguchi,Shota Kubo,,","This is the first study of a real physical kneed bipedal robot that exhibits passive dynamic running (PDR). Passive dynamic walking (PDW), which has its roots in the pioneering research of McGeer, intrinsically offers not only nonlinear phenomena such as the pull-in effect and period-doubling bifurcation, but also offers an extremely interesting phenomenon that facilitates the engineering of a highly efficient walking robot. In recent years, a wide variety of verification experiments in PDW were performed using actual devices. In contrast, however, very few studies addressed PDR. In the present study, we developed a two-dimensional real physical passive dynamic running biped with knees. The device stands 400 mm tall and weights 4.8 kg. By carefully designing the properties of the elastic elements implemented into the hip joints and the stance legs in the present device, we achieved stable passive dynamic running of 36 steps. The device runs at about 0.83 m/s down a 0.22 rad slope. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first report of such a performance. This result is expected to prove useful not only for designing human-like natural and efficient bipedal robots, but also for understanding the principles underlying bipedal locomotion.",39
icra,None,Constrained convergent gait regulation for a climbing robot,"Salomon Trujillo,Barrett Heyneman,Mark Cutkosky,","The priorities of a climbing legged robot are to maintain a grasp on its climbing surface and to climb efficiently against the force of gravity. These priorities profoundly constrain the choice of gait regulation methods. We propose a gait regulation and analysis method that varies foot detachment timing, effectively modifying stride length and frequency in order to maintain gait phasing, subject to kinematic and stability constraints. The method results in linear equations, leading to straightforward tests for local and global convergence when, for example, disturbances such as foot slippage cause departures from the nominal phasing. We illustrate the procedure with an example involving a bounding gait and compare it with empirical results obtained on the RiSE climbing robot.",6

Moritz Maus,Christian Rode,,","Bipedal walking could be implemented into a robot by mimicking spring-like leg behaviour. The fundamental model, describing human-like leg function in walking is the bipedal spring-mass model which was investigated in this study. We identified several types of walking patterns, e.g. symmetric and asymmetric walking, that accounts for high variability of gait. The aim of this study is the identification of a stiffness range which allows for stable walking with comparatively large robustness against perturbations. Walking with compliant legs was tested with the bipedal PogoWalker, demonstrating advantages of the underlying leg mechanics, i.e. walking without the necessity of precise leg adjustments, and acceptable impact forces.",83

The robot learns from simulations, therefore no a priori knowledge is required. The results show that the method is general enough to work on various types of terrain. The planned footholds enable the robot to walk more stable, avoiding slippages and fall-downs.",38

icra,None,On the influence of ship motion prediction accuracy on motion planning and control of robotic manipulators on seaborne platforms,"Pål J. From,Jan T. Gravdahl,Pieter Abbeel,","Robotic manipulators on non-inertial platforms, such as ships, have to endure large inertial forces due to the non-inertial motion of the platform. When the non-inertial platform's motion is known, motion planning and control algorithms can eliminate these perturbations-in fact, in some situations the motion planning algorithms can even leverage the inertial forces to more cheaply move to a target point. However, for many non-inertial platforms, the motion is unknown. In this paper we investigate how prediction errors and the choice of the prediction horizon affect the motion planning and control of robots mounted on a non-inertial base with a particular focus on seaborne platforms. We study the following three aspects: (i) We study prediction of ship motion and how prediction errors affect the motion planning and control of the manipulator. (ii) We evaluate the relationship between prediction accuracy and control. In particular, we study what prediction horizon length is useful for motion planning and control. We also consider how uncertainties in the ship motion predictions map to uncertainties in the future state of the robot and how to include the variance in the cost function to increase the optimal horizon length. (iii) Finally, we study a receding horizon approach, which re-solves the optimal control problem on-line over a horizon as determined to be meaningful from (ii). Several simulations are presented and, to our knowledge, for the first time experiments of ship-manipulator systems based on real ship motion data are presented.",18
icra,None,Design of an omnidirectional propulsion system for small jet-boats,"David Foley,Jean-Sebastien Plante,","Jet-boats perform remarkably well at high-speed but lack low speed maneuverability for tight maneuvers such as ducking. This paper presents a low speed omnidirectional propulsion system controlled with a joystick for jet-boats. Two concepts are presented and evaluated. The first concept uses all original parts. The second concept uses a set of fix jet nozzles disposed around the hull. The position and angles of the nozzles are optimized with an index of omnidirectionality quality based on the projection of a set of force solutions on a shell with the shape of the desired force space. A 3D simulator backed by experimental results serves for the evaluation by potential customers of each design. The first concept exhibited poor maneuverability, as it offers ten times less force in sway than in surge. The optimized force space of the second concept is much more uniform, and was unanimously appreciated for its quality of low speed maneuverability. Both designs have been validated experimentally. The present work offers an omnidirectional propulsion system that is easy to enhance with advanced control laws. Velocity feedback control is given as example, and shows important improvement of maneuverability and robustness to miscalibration.",2
icra,None,Complete SE3 underwater robot control with arbitrary thruster configurations,"Marek Doniec,Iuliu Vasilescu,Carrick Detweiler,Daniela Rus,","We present a control algorithm for autonomous underwater robots with modular thruster configuration. The algorithm can handle arbitrary thruster configurations. It maintains the robot's desired attitude while solving for translational motion. The attitude can be arbitrarily chosen from the special orthogonal group SO 3 allowing the robot all possible orientations. The desired translational velocities can be chosen from R 3 allowing the robot to follow arbitrary trajectories underwater. If the robot is not fully holonomic then the controller chooses the closest possible solution using least squares and outputs the error vector. We verify the controller with experiments using our autonomous underwater robot AMOUR. We achieve roll errors of 1.0 degree (2.1 degrees standard deviation) and pitch errors of 1.5 degrees (1.8 degrees standard deviation). We also demonstrate experimentally that the controller can handle both nonholonomic and fully holonomic thruster configurations of the robot. In the later case we show how depth can be maintained while performing 360 degree rolls. Further, we demonstrate an input device that allows a user to control the robot's attitude while moving along a desired trajectory.",28
icra,None,Performance evaluation of monocular predictive display,"Adam Rachmielowski,Neil Birkbeck,Martin Jägersand,","In teleoperation systems, operator performance is negatively affected by time-delayed visual feedback. Predictive display (PD) compensates for delays by providing synthesized visual feedback. While most existing PD methods rely on a priori models (e.g., from laser range finding or stereo vision), recent work on monocular SLAM and SFM makes it possible to acquire PD models in single camera applications. In this work, we evaluate operator performance of PD visual feedback based on a coarse 3D model. We report the experimental results of 12 human tele-operators each performing 96 visual alignment tasks with a 300ms delay. Four operating modes are considered: delayed video (no PD), video-based PD using a stabilizing plane (homography), 3D model-based PD, and no delay (ground truth). The results indicate that vision-based PD (both plane and 3D model-based) is significantly better than delayed video. It reduced task completion time 40% and is nearly as good as the no delay condition. PD based on a sparse a 3D model was somewhat better than the simpler plane based method.",19

The approach is to construct an ordered symbolic language for smooth planar curves and to use these curves as desired paths for the aircraft. The underlying problem is then to design a communication protocol by which the pilot can, with vanishing error probability, specify a string in this language using a sequence of bits sent through a binary symmetric channel in the presence of noiseless feedback. Such a protocol is provided by the combination of arithmetic coding as a method of lossless data compression with posterior matching as a capacity-achieving channel code.

icra,None,Generalized Bilateral MIMO Control by States Convergence with time delay and application for the teleoperation of a 2-DOF helicopter,"Claudia Pérez-D'Arpino,Wilfredis Medina-Meléndez,Leonardo Fermín-León,,,,","Bilateral Control by States Convergence is a novel and little exploited control strategy that has been successfully applied to the teleoperation of robotic manipulators using SISO control. Based on the state space representation, the main philosophy of this control strategy consists in achieving convergence of states between the master and the slave, by setting the dynamical behavior of the master-slave error as a states-independent autonomous system. This paper presents a generalization of this strategy to MIMO systems, with time delay in the master-slave communication channels. It is demonstrated how the feedback gains required by the state convergence control schema can be found by solving a set of ((m × n) + (m × m) + n ) nonlinear equations for a system with m inputs, n states and m outputs. Unlike previous research, which has been applied only to manipulators considering 1-DOF for the states-convergence control loop, the extension to the general MIMO case has allowed to apply the technique to the teleoperation of a 2-DOF helicopter. A decoupling network and states-feedback are used for local control, while the states-convergence control manages the bilateral issues. Simulation results are presented, showing a satisfactory performance of the control strategy.",7

The control problem is formulated as a multi-objective constrained optimization. The objective function is a metric which quantifies the detection and discrimination capacity of the human operator. The constraints are position tracking accuracy and absolute stability of the scaled teleoperation. Two popular control architectures, i.e., the position-position and the force-position control architectures are considered in this paper.

icra,None,User-controlled variable impedance teleoperation,"Daniel S. Walker,Robert P. Wilson,Günter Niemeyer,","Telerobotics fundamentally aims to project human skills into a remote, unstructured environment. A key component of human skills is anticipatory modulation of limb impedances in accordance with task requirements and in expectation of events or disturbances. These adjustments occur continually in human interaction strategies, yet are mostly masked in telerobotics by limited bandwidth controllers and fixed impedance hardware. We propose a telerobotic architecture with user-controlled variable impedance and show a single degree of freedom experimental implementation. The master incorporates a grip force sensor as an additional impedance command channel. Since grip force correlates with the user's own impedance, this input provides an intuitive and natural extension to the regular interface. On the slave, a physically variable clutch actuator is used to adjust both low and high frequency impedance. The additional command channel allows the operator to utilize impedance variation strategies to control impact forces and accomplish varying tasks. These natural interaction strategies are simpler and more robust, leading to superior performance and a telerobot which more effectively represents the operator.",24
icra,None,Improvement of model-mediated teleoperation using a new hybrid environment estimation technique,"Andreas Achhammer,Carolina Weber,Angelika Peer,Martin Buss,","In a haptic teleoperation system, the incorporation of knowledge about the remote environment in the controller design can improve stability and performance. Model-mediated teleoperation adopts this idea by rendering an estimated model of the remote environment on local site instead of transmitting force/velocity flows. Thus, the user perceives locally generated forces corresponding to the estimated and transmitted model parameters and the control loop between master and slave is opened. Less conservative stability boundaries and the applicability to teleoperation systems with arbitrary time delay are the main advantages of this approach. In order to guarantee a high fidelity, the estimation has to fit well with the measurements. In this paper, we extend the approach of model-mediated teleoperation to a full 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) teleoperation system with negligible time delay. We furthermore propose a hybrid approach for the estimation of the remote environment by combining the classical Kelvin-Voigt model and the nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model. Persistent excitation and device-dependent limitations of the estimation algorithm are discussed. Experimental results show stability and accuracy of the estimation technique as well as a superior fidelity of the proposed approach compared to a position-based admittance controller with fixed parameters even with negligible time delay.",53

The paper also proves that the teleoperator is Input-to-State Stable from human operator and environment inputs to some synchronization signals. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.",6
icra,None,Consistent mapping of multistory buildings by introducing global constraints to graph-based SLAM,"Michael Karg,Kai M. Wurm,Cyrill Stachniss,Klaus Dietmayer,Wolfram Burgard,","In the past, there has been a tremendous advance in the area of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there are relatively few approaches for incorporating prior information or knowledge about structural similarities into the mapping process. Consider, for example, office buildings in which most of the offices have an identical geometric layout. The same typically holds for the individual stories of buildings. In this paper, we propose an approach for generating alignment constraints between different floors of the same building in the context of graph-based SLAM. This is done under the assumption that the individual floors of a building share at least some structural properties. To identify such areas, we apply a particle filter-based localization approach using maps and observations from different floors. We evaluate our system using several real datasets as well as in simulation. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly align multiple floors and allows the robot to generate consistent models of multi-story buildings.",22
icra,None,Applying domain knowledge to SLAM using virtual measurements,"Alexander J. B. Trevor,John G. Rogers,Carlos Nieto,Henrik I. Christensen,","Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) aims to estimate the maximum likelihood map and robot pose based on a robot's control and sensor measurements. In structured environments, such as human environments, we might have additional domain knowledge that could be applied to produce higher quality mapping results. We present a method for using virtual measurements, which are measurements between two features in our map. To demonstrate this, we present a system that uses such virtual measurements to relate visually detected points to walls detected with a laser scanner.",20
icra,None,Affordable SLAM through the co-design of hardware and methodology,"Stéphane Magnenat,Valentin Longchamp,Michael Bonani,Philippe Rétornaz,,,,","Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a prominent feature for autonomous robots operating in undefined environments. Applications areas such as consumer robotics appliances would clearly benefit from low-cost and compact SLAM implementations. The SLAM research community has developed several robust algorithms in the course of the last two decades. However, until now most SLAM demonstrators have relied on expensive sensors or large processing power, limiting their realms of application. Several works have explored optimizations into various directions; however none has presented a global optimization from the mechatronic to the algorithmic level. In this article, we present a solution to the SLAM problem based on the co-design of a slim rotating distance scanner, a lightweight SLAM software, and an optimization methodology. The scanner consists of a set of infrared distance sensors mounted on a contactless rotating platform. The SLAM algorithm is an adaptation of FastSLAM 2.0 that runs in real time on a miniature robot. The optimization methodology finds the parameters of the SLAM algorithm using an evolution strategy. This work demonstrates that an inexpensive sensor coupled with a low-speed processor are good enough to perform SLAM in simple environments in real time.",41
icra,None,Probabilistic mapping for mobile robots using spatial correlation models,"Benjamin Pitzer,Christoph Stiller,","Generating accurate environment representations can significantly improve the autonomy of mobile robots. In this article we present a novel probabilistic technique for solving the full SLAM problem by jointly solving the data registration problem and the accurate reconstruction of the underlying geometry. The key idea of this paper is to incorporate spatial correlation models as prior knowledge on the map we seek to construct. We formulate the mapping problem as a maximum a-posteriori estimation comprising common probabilistic motion and sensor models as well as two spatial correlation models to guide the optimization. Instead of discarding data at an early stage, our algorithm makes use of all data available in the optimization process. When applied to SLAM, our method generates maps that closely resemble the real environment. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art algorithms, using both real and synthetic data sets.",5
icra,None,Rao-Blackwellised PHD SLAM,"John Mullane,Ba-Ngu Vo,Martin D. Adams,","This paper proposes a tractable solution to feature-based (FB) SLAM in the presence of data association uncertainty and uncertainty in the number of features. By modeling the feature map as a random finite set (RFS), a rigorous Bayesian formulation of the FB-SLAM problem that accounts for uncertainty in the number of features and data association is presented. As such, the joint posterior distribution of the set-valued map and vehicle trajectory is propagated forward in time as measurements arrive. A first order solution, coined the PHD-SLAM filter, is derived, which jointly propagates the posterior PHD or intensity function of the map and the posterior distribution of the trajectory of the vehicle. A Rao-Blackwellised implementation of the PHD-SLAM filter is proposed based on the Gaussian mixture PHD filter for the map and a particle filter for the vehicle trajectory. Simulated results demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach, particularly in situations of high clutter and data association ambiguity.",51
icra,None,Relaxed optimization for mode estimation in skid steering,"T. M. Caldwell,T. D. Murphey,","Skid-steered vehicles, by design, must skid in order to maneuver. The skidding causes the vehicle to behave discontinuously as well as introduces complications to the observation of the vehicle's state, both of which affect a controller's performance. This paper addresses estimation of contact state by applying switched system optimization to estimate skidding properties of the skid-steered vehicle. In order to treat the skid-steered vehicle as a switched system, the vehicle's ground interaction is modeled using Coulomb friction, thereby partitioning the system dynamics into four distinct modes, one for each combination of the forward and back wheel pairs sticking or skidding. Thus, as the vehicle maneuvers, the system propagates over some mode sequence, transitioning between modes over some set of switching times. This paper presents a technique for estimating a mode sequence by optimizing a relaxation of an infinite dimensional representation of switched systems. The switching times themselves may then be estimated using switching time optimization techniques.",5
icra,None,Location of optical mouse sensors on mobile robots for odometry,"Mauro Cimino,Prabhakar R. Pagilla,","Optical mouse sensors have been utilized recently to measure position of mobile robots. This work provides a systematic solution to the problem of locating N optical mouse sensors on a mobile robot with the aim of increasing the quality of the measurement. The developed analysis gives insights on how the selection of a particular configuration reflects on the quality of the measurement signal, and it allows to compare the effectiveness of different configurations. The set of all the optimal configurations is parameterized into two constraints. The results are derived from the analysis of the singular values of a particular matrix obtained by solving the sensor kinematics problem. Moreover, given any mobile robot platform, an end-user procedure is provided to select the best location for N optical mouse sensors on such a platform. The procedure consists of solving a feasible constrained optimization problem.",19
icra,None,Instantaneous centre of rotation estimation of an omnidirectional mobile robot,"Lionel Clavien,Michel Lauria,François Michaud,","Redundantly actuated mobile robots using conventional wheels need a precise coordination of their actuators in order to guarantee a safe and precise motion without generating high internal forces and slippage. Using the instantaneous centre of rotation (ICR) of the chassis to describe this motion is a well established method. But the ICR is a mathematical concept which is hardly achieved on a real robot. This paper addresses the problem of ICR estimation of a non-holonomic omnidirectional mobile robot using conventional wheels. Instead of estimating the ICR in the working space, our approach estimates it in the actuators' space. The algorithm is presented in its general form and then adapted for a particular robot. The use of the algorithm with other omnidirectional robots is also discussed. Results from extensive testing done in simulation as well as with a real robot are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",23
icra,None,On-line kinematics reasoning for reconfigurable robot drives,"Michael Hofbaur,Mathias Brandstötter,Christoph Schörghuber,Gerald Steinbauer,","The control system for a mobile robot typically assumes fixed kinematics according to the drive's geometry and functionality. Faults in the system, for example a blocked steering actuator, will then lead to an undesired behaviour, unless one takes care of specific single and/or multiple faults explicitly. We present a novel model-programmed procedure for on-line kinematics reasoning that allows a robot to deduce the (inverse)-kinematics of the drive and also its kinematic abilities for the specific modes of operation and some falt modes during operation. As a consequence, we can reconfigure a robot drive to compensate for some faults and also inform a higher level control system about changed mobility capabilities of a robot. Being fault tolerant is, however, only one advantage of our approach that derives the kinematics control strategy from a geometric and functional model of the drive. We can easily adapt the controller for various robot drives, handle drives that change their geometry and functionality during run-time and also provide the basis for a flexible control scheme for self-configuring multi-robot systems.",3
icra,None,Magnetic field-based sensing method for spherical joint,"Shaohui Foong,Kok-Meng Lee,Kun Bai,","This paper presents a sensing method that harnesses the capacity of modern sensors to measure vector fields. This approach directly maps distributed independent field measurements to the instantaneous orientation of a spherical joint embedded with low-cost permanent magnets. Unlike existing methods which require a priori and precise field models, this direct method engages an artificial neural network to associate a collection of measurements to joint orientation. The operation of both bipolar and unipolar single and multi-axis sensors were considered and evaluated experimentally.",19
icra,None,Coordinated multi-robot real-time exploration with connectivity and bandwidth awareness,"Yuanteng Pei,Matt W. Mutka,Ning Xi,","While there has been substantial progress for multi-robot exploration of an unknown area, little attention has been given to communication, especially bandwidth constraints in time-sensitive and bandwidth-consuming tasks such as search and surveillance. In such tasks, video/audio streams of a newly explored area should be sent back to the base station in a timely manner. To address this issue, we propose Connectivity and Bandwidth Aware eXploration (CBAX), which is an efficient iteration based real-time exploration. CBAX divides the problem into frontier node placement, relay node placement with routing path selection, and the match of each robot with its target position. Moreover, we model bandwidth-constrained relay node placement into a new variant of the Steiner Minimum Tree problem and present our solution. While reducing the exploration time, CBAX maintains the network's connectivity and ensures the aggregated data flows are under the link capacity in transmission. Simulation shows that CBAX outperforms two recent exploration schemes qualitatively by demonstrating major improvement in terms of non-overflow transmission time and fully-connected transmission time. With enhanced communication quality, CBAX still reduces the exploration time, on average, by 40% and 15% respectively. In moderately dense scenarios, CBAX even decreases time by 50% and 25%.",65

In this paper, we present a localization and tethering approach that relies solely on wireless signal strength and robot odometry without requiring any known reference points in the domain. We introduce a data-driven, probabilistic model that maps received signal strength (RSS) values to real-world distance distributions and embed this model in a grid-based localization algorithm that successfully performs the LANdroids tethering task. We furthermore show, that it is possible to improve localization through the addition of a compass sensor and inter-robot information sharing.",49
icra,None,Towards simplicial coverage repair for mobile robot teams,"Jason Derenick,Vijay Kumar,Ali Jadbabaie,","In this note, we present initial results towards developing a distributed algorithm for repairing topological holes in the sensor cover of a mobile robot team. Central to our approach is the melding of recent advances in the application of computational homology (a sub-discipline of algebraic topology) to static sensor networks with relative metric information (i.e. relative pose). More precisely, we consider a greedy, hybrid (discrete-continuous) algorithm whereby a desired Cěch complex, the simplicial complex that captures the underlying topology of the sensing cover, is iteratively generated using local rules (between multi-hop neighbors) and agents are driven towards achieving this topology via a gradient-ascent simplicial control law. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is established as a function of the convergence of the underlying simplicial control law, and the relationship of the latter to the spectrum of the combinatorial Laplacian is considered. Simulation results for teams operating in ℝ 2 are presented.",13
icra,None,Multi-robot flooding algorithm for the exploration of unknown indoor environments,"Flavio Cabrera-Mora,Jizhong Xiao,Peter Brass,","In this paper we study the problem of multi-robot exploration of unknown indoor environments that are modeled as trees. Specifically, our approach consider that robots deploy and communicate with active landmarks in every intersection they encounter. We present a novel algorithm that is guaranteed to completely explore any tree with m edges and diameter D, by allowing k robots to be fed into the tree one at a time. We prove that the exploration time of the algorithm grows in linear proportion with the size of the tree and is not bigger than D+m. Simulation results are presented that corroborate the theoretical analysis.",4
icra,None,Reconfiguration algorithms for mobile robotic networks,"Nilanjan Chakraborty,Katia Sycara,","For a deployed mobile robotic network to function usefully, the robots should have the capability to adjust their positions, while maintaining the network connectivity. In this paper, we present algorithms that allows a robot to decide when it is feasible for it to move to a desired point by adjusting its own positions (and the positions of some other robots in the network), while maintaining all the network connectivity constraints. Under the assumption of a disc model of communication, we show that the problem can be formulated as a convex optimization (or feasibility) problem (actually a second order cone program). Thus, the problem can be solved in polynomial time by centralized interior point algorithms. However, this requires the robot to have knowledge of the position of all the nodes in the network. Our main contribution is the development of an incremental algorithm, that solves the feasibility problem (of whether the robot can move to its desired goal) by obtaining the information about the position of the robots and their immediate neighbors only if they are required to move. We present simulation results comparing the performance of the centralized algorithm with the incremental algorithm for randomly generated networks. From simulation results, we observe that the time required by the incremental algorithm to solve the feasibility problem is relatively independent of the size of the network.",26
icra,None,An iterative Mixed Integer Linear Programming Approach to pursuit evasion problems in polygonal environments,"Johan Thunberg,Petter Ögren,","In this paper, we address the multi pursuer version of the pursuit evasion problem in polygonal environments. It is well known that this problem is NP-hard, and therefore we seek efficient, but not optimal, solutions by relaxing the problem and applying the tools of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Approaches using MILP and RHC are known to produce efficient algorithms in other path planning domains, such as obstacle avoidance. Here we show how the MILP formalism can be used in a pursuit evasion setting to capture the motion of the pursuers as well as the partitioning of the pursuit search region into a cleared and a contaminated part. RHC is furthermore a well known way of balancing performance and computation requirements by iteratively solving path planning problems over a receding planning horizon, and adapt the length of that horizon to the computational resources available. The proposed approach is implemented in Matlab/Cplex and illustrated by a number of solved examples.",10
icra,None,Simulation-based LQR-trees with input and state constraints,"Philipp Reist,Russ Tedrake,","We present an algorithm that probabilistically covers a bounded region of the state space of a nonlinear system with a sparse tree of feedback stabilized trajectories leading to a goal state. The generated tree serves as a lookup table control policy to get any reachable initial condition within that region to the goal. The approach combines motion planning with reasoning about the set of states around a trajectory for which the feedback policy of the trajectory is able to stabilize the system. The key idea is to use a random sample from the bounded region for both motion planning and approximation of the stabilizable sets by falsification; this keeps the number of samples and simulations needed to generate covering policies reasonably low. We simulate the nonlinear system to falsify the stabilizable sets, which allows enforcing input and state constraints. Compared to the algebraic verification using sums of squares optimization in our previous work, the simulation-based approximation of the stabilizable set is less exact, but considerably easier to implement and can be applied to a broader range of nonlinear systems. We show simulation results obtained with model systems and study the performance and robustness of the generated policies.",52
icra,None,Evader surveillance under incomplete information,"Israel Becerra,Rafael Murrieta-Cid,Raul Monroy,","This paper is concerned with determining whether a mobile robot, called the pursuer, is up to maintaining visibility of an antagonist agent, called the evader. This problem, a variant of pursuit-evasion, has been largely studied, following a systematic treatment by increasingly relaxing a number of restrictions. In, we considered a scenario where the pursuer and the evader move at bound speed, traveling around a known, 2D environment, which contains obstacles. Then, considering that, in an attempt to escape, the evader travels the shortest path to reach a potential escape region, we provided a decision procedure that determines whether or not the pursuer is up to maintain visibility of the evader and obtained complexity measures of this surveillance task. In this paper, we prove that there are cases for which an evader may escape only if it does not travel the shortest path to an escapable region. We introduce planning strategies for the movement of the pursuer that keeps track of the evader, even if the evader chooses not to travel the shortest path to an escape region. We also present a sufficient condition for the evader to escape that does not depend on the initial positions of the players. It can be verified only using the environment. All our algorithms have been implemented and we show simulation results.",4
icra,None,Guaranteed navigation with an unreliable blind robot,"Jeremy S. Lewis,Jason M. O'Kane,","We consider a navigation problem for a robot equipped with only a map, compass, and contact sensor. In addition to the limitations placed on sensing, we assume that there exists some bounded uncertainty on rotations of our robot, due to precision errors from the compass. We present an algorithm providing guaranteed transitions in the environment between certain pairs of points. The algorithm chains these transitions together to form complete navigation plans. The simplicity of the robot's design allows us to concentrate on the nature of the navigation problem, rather than the design and implementation of our robotic system. We illustrate the algorithm with an implementation and simulated results.",9
icra,None,Optimal coverage of a known arbitrary environment,"Raphael Mannadiar,Ioannis Rekleitis,","The problem of coverage of known space by a mobile robot has many applications. Of particular interest is providing a solution that guarantees the complete coverage of the free space by traversing an optimal path, in terms of the distance travelled. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm based on the Boustrophedon cellular decomposition. The presented algorithm encodes the areas (cells) to be covered as edges of the Reeb graph. The optimal solution to the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is used to calculate an Euler tour, which guarantees complete coverage of the available free space while minimizing the path of the robot. In addition, we extend the classical solution of the CPP to account for the entry point of the robot for cell coverage by changing the weights of the Reeb graph edges. Proof of correctness is provided together with experimental results in different environments.",105
icra,None,Visual servoing from three points using a spherical projection model,"Romeo Tatsambon Fomena,Omar Tahri,François Chaumette,","This paper deals with visual servoing from three points. Using the geometric properties of the spherical projection of points, a new decoupled set of six visual features is proposed. The main originality lies in the use of the distances between spherical projection of points to define three features that are invariant to camera rotations. The three other features present a linear link with respect to camera rotations. In comparison with the classical perspective coordinates of points, the new decoupled set does not present more singularities. In addition, using the new set in its non-singular domain, a classical control law is proven to be ideal for rotational motions. These theoretical results as well as the robustness to errors of the new decoupled control scheme are illustrated through simulation results.",4
icra,None,Robust hand-eye calibration for computer aided medical endoscopy,"Abed Malti,João P. Barreto,","Endoscopic camera for surgical navigation and 3D visualization requires precise and stable estimates of the calibration parameters. The estimation of the hand-eye transform between the camera frame and the opto-tracked body of the endoscope is an important issue of the calibration. This paper presents a new stable method for the hand-eye calibration problem. The most popular method estimates the transform directly in the special euclidean group SE(3) by computing separately the rotation and the translation. The second famous approach formulates the problem in the dual quaternion space and estimates jointly the rotation and the translation. In a first glance, the simultaneous estimation seems to be always advantageous. However, and according to the experiments, this is not the case for the rotation estimation that is affected by the noise in translation. Our approach takes advantage of the both methods and uses the dual quaternion to estimate separately the rotation and the translation. We show experimentally that our algorithm is more stable with minimal number and small amplitude of motions.",43
icra,None,Spherical image-based visual servo and structure estimation,"Peter I. Corke,","This paper presents a formulation of image-based visual servoing (IBVS) for a spherical camera where coordinates are parameterized in terms of colatitude and longitude: IBVS-Sph. The image Jacobian is derived and simulation results are presented for canonical rotational, translational as well as general motion. Problems with large rotations that affect the planar perspective form of IBVS are not present on the sphere, whereas the desirable robustness properties of IBVS are shown to be retained. We also describe a structure from motion (SfM) system based on camera-centric spherical coordinates and show how a recursive estimator can be used to recover structure. The spherical formulations for IBVS and SfM are particularly suitable for platforms, such as aerial and underwater robots, that move in SE(3).",42
icra,None,A switching control law for a networked visual servo control system,"Haiyan Wu,Chih-Chung Chen,Jiayun Feng,Kolja Kühnlenz,Sandra Hirche,","In this paper, a novel switching controller is proposed for a networked visual servo control system with varying feedback delay due to image processing and data transmission. The varying image processing delay caused by the varying number of extracted features for pose estimation due to different view angles, illumination conditions and noise, is modeled by its occurrence probability. The time delay due to transmission over the communication network is also modeled as random process. By using a sampled-data system approach and an input-delay approach, the linearized visual servo control system is reformulated into a stochastic continuous-time system with time-varying delay. A novel stability condition and associated switching controller are derived based on the occurrence probabilities of delays. Experiments on a 1-DoF linear module equipped with a camera are conducted to validate the proposed approach. A non-switching controller approach is implemented for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement of the proposed control approach.",18
icra,None,Robust Jacobian estimation for uncalibrated visual servoing,"Azad Shademan,Amir-massoud Farahmand,Martin Jägersand,","This paper addresses robust estimation of the uncalibrated visual-motor Jacobian for an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) system. The proposed method does not require knowledge of model or system parameters and is robust to outliers caused by various visual tracking errors, such as occlusion or mis-tracking. Previous uncalibrated methods are not robust to outliers and assume that the visual-motor data belong to the underlying model. In unstructured environments, this assumption may not hold. Outliers to the visual-motor model may deteriorate the Jacobian, which can make the system unstable or drive the arm in the wrong direction. We propose to apply a statistically robust M-estimator to reject the outliers. We compare the quality of the robust Jacobian estimation with the least squares-based estimation. The effect of outliers on the estimation quality is studied through MATLAB simulations and eye-in-hand visual servoing experiments using a WAM arm. Experimental results show that the Jacobian estimated by robust M-estimation is robust when up to 40% of the visual-motor data are outliers.",68

Using a non-structured teaching environment, the inherent task in the captured demonstration force and position data is estimated and reconstructed from three sets of complimentary models, including analytical mathematical modelling, empirical modelling and human skill demonstration modelling. The approach addresses task specification accuracy deficiencies, and involves outward interface simplifications, with embedded rigorous analytical methodologies that enable users to realise complex and robust constrained compliant robot motion without dealing with the low level motion generation aspects. Function based task representation supports an intuitive approach to generate robust constrained motion by skill superimposition, as exemplified by peg-in-hole with crank turning.",2

Our robotic wheelchair aims to assist users in driving safely, without undermining their capabilities or curtailing the natural development of their skills. An important research question is to determine the conditions under which shared control is most beneficial. In this paper, we describe an experiment, where a distracting secondary task caused the majority of participants to crash the wheelchair when driving without assistance. However, when they were assisted by our collaborative controller, not only did they drive safely, but they also increased their performance in the secondary task. We demonstrate that a degree of shared control is beneficial even to proficient drivers under certain circumstances, for instance when they are under a heightened workload.",66

icra,None,Simulation platform for self-assembly structures in MRI-guided nanorobotic drug delivery systems,"Panagiotis Vartholomeos,Constantinos Mavroidis,","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided nanorobotic systems that could perform diagnostic, curative and reconstructive treatments in the human body at the cellular and sub-cellular level in a controllable manner have recently been proposed. The concept of a MRI-guided nanorobotic system is based on the use of a MRI scanner to induce the required external driving forces to guide magnetic nanocapsules to a specific target. However, the maximum magnetic gradient specifications of existing clinical MRI systems are not capable of driving superparamagnetic nanocapsules against the blood flow and therefore these MRIs do not allow for navigation. The present paper proposes a way to overcome this critical drawback through the formation of micron size agglomerations where their size can be regulated by external magnetic stimuli. This approach is investigated through modeling of the physics that govern the self-assembly of the nanoparticles. Additionally a computational tool has been developed that incorporates the derived models and performs simulation, visualization and post-processing analysis. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate that external magnetic field causes aggregation of nanoparticles while they flow in the vessel. This is a promising result -in accordance with similar experimental results- and encourages further investigation on the nanoparticle based self-assembly structures for use in nanorobotic drug delivery.",33

This is particularly useful for guiding steerable needles in soft tissues. In this paper we combine a new minimally invasive surface scanning technique based on conoscopic holography with a steerable active cannula robot. We experimentally demonstrate cannula tip placement to multiple physical points inside phantom tissue, which correspond to points specified in preoperative images - the input an eventual clinical system would obtain from the physician. While the image-guided steerable system we propose is broadly applicable to many kinds of surgery, one particular application of interest is in ablating large liver tumors, where it is beneficial for the ablator to be repositioned to multiple locations without being withdrawn from the organ.",29
icra,None,Precise robot motions using dual motor control,"Sven Gestegård Robertz,Lorenz Halt,Sameer Kelkar,Klas Nilsson,,,,","High motion performance, stiffness, and accuracy are crucial for industrial robot applications, but these requirements are in practice contradictory. Using a novel type of robot, the so called Gantry Tau, new combinations of stiffness and accuracy are in principle possible, except for the backlash in the drive-trains of each joint. Existing techniques for backlash reduction are either mechanically complex or limit the mechanical bandwidth. This paper presents an approach based on dual motors connected in parallel to the load, such that the entire robot structure can be made practically backlash free by means of software and feedback control. Different control strategies are presented and evaluated in experiments ranging from a lab servo process via a table-sized robot to a large industrial implementation with several meters of working range. Special emphasis was on a dual motor test rig with a linear high-resolution scale (not yet used for feedback) where the combined motor torque was fully utilized for high acceleration, while reducing backlash by over 96%.",31
icra,None,Sensorless linear induction motor control using fuzzy observers for speed tracking,"Peter Liu,Cheng-Yao Hung,Chian-Song Chiu,Kuang-Yow Lian,","In this paper, a sensorless speed controller for linear induction motor (LIM) is developed based on a fuzzy observer. First, the LIM is represented by a T-S fuzzy model. Next, the fuzzy observer is constructed to estimate the immeasurable states including the mover speed and secondary flux, where the observer gains are obtained by computationally solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Based on the fuzzy observer, the synthesis using the virtual desired variable concept is applied to design the control law. Then, the exponential convergence for both estimation error and tracking error is concluded. This indicates that the proposed sensorless speed control possesses the feature with fast transient response and high robustness. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical results and show satisfactory performance.",8
