How do graphs evolve over time? How does influence/news/viruses propagate, over time? We focus on three topics: (a) anomaly detection in large static graphs (b) patterns and anomalies in large time-evolving graphs and (c) cascades and immunization. For the first, we present a list of static and temporal laws, including advances patterns like 'eigenspokes'; we show how to use them to spot suspicious activities, in on-line buyer-and-seller settings, in FaceBook, in twitter-like networks. For the second, we show how to handle time-evolving graphs as tensors, how to handle large tensors in map-reduce environments, as well as some discoveries such settings. For the third, we show that for virus propagation, a single number is enough to characterize the connectivity of graph, and thus we show how to do efficient immunization for almost any type of virus (SIS - no immunity; SIR - lifetime immunity; etc) We conclude with some open research questions for graph mining."

For instance, the huge amount of information from the web offers people unprecedented levels of opportunities for education, entertainments, social activities, productivity improvements, and business. The web, however, has also become perilous with many dangers, such as privacy violation and security breaches, and therein exist many villains who would like to turn into victims scrupulous as well as casual users. In this regard, WWW has become almost like Wild Wild West, where wonderful opportunities and great perils co-existed. Tizen (www.tizen.org) is a web-centric open-source, standards-based software platform for smart devices, such as smartphones, smart TVs, IVI (In-Vehicle Infotainment) and other consumer devices like cameras, printers, and more. Tizen is web-centric in that it directly supports web apps - applications (apps) written in HTML5 and Javascript - even outside the web-browsers and provides seamless supports for the web. As such, Tizen not only shares the benefits and perils of the web with other platforms, but also has the additional burden to meet the performance of non-web platforms: platforms that directly support only conventional programming languages. In this talk, we present Tizen's approaches to taming the web to maximize its benefits while minimizing the risks of its perils. We also describe various optimizations of Tizen that enable delivering web-app performance on par with that of non-web platforms."

We formulate the optimal solution to this explore/exploit problem as a dynamic programming problem and show that efficiency is maximized by making a bid for each advertiser equal to the advertiser's expected value for the advertising opportunity plus a term proportional to the variance in this value divided by the number of impressions the advertiser has received thus far. We then use this result to illustrate that the value of incorporating active exploration into a machine learning system in an auction environment is exceedingly small.

These platforms often use fixed-percentage sharing schemes, according to which (i) the platform runs an auction amongst buyers, and (ii) gives the seller a constant-fraction (e.g., 80%) of the auction proceeds. In these settings, the platform faces asymmetric information regarding both the valuations of buyers for the item (as in a standard auction environment) as well as about the seller's opportunity cost of selling the item. Moreover, platforms often face intense competition from similar market places, and such competition is likely to favor auction rules that secure high payoffs to sellers. In such an environment, what selling mechanism should platforms employ? Our goal in this paper is to study optimal mechanism design in settings plagued by competition and two-sided asymmetric information, and identify conditions under which the current practice of employing constant cuts is indeed optimal."

The common method for monetizing such streams is to insert ads in between news items. In this paper, we model this setting, and observe that allocation and pricing of ad insertions in a stream poses interesting algorithmic and mechanism design challenges. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem that captures a typical stream ad placement setting. We give an approximation algorithm for this problem that provably achieves a value close to the optimal, and show how this algorithm can be turned into an incentive compatible mechanism. Finally, we conclude with a simple practical algorithm that makes the allocation decisions in an online fashion. We prove this algorithm to be approximately welfare-maximizing and show that it also has good incentive properties."

Oliner, ","There is little information from independent sources in the public domain about mobile malware infection rates. The only previous independent estimate (0.0009%) [11], was based on indirect measurements obtained from domain-name resolution traces. In this paper, we present the first independent study of malware infection rates and associated risk factors using data collected directly from over 55,000 Android devices. We find that the malware infection rates in Android devices estimated using two malware datasets (0.28% and 0.26%), though small, are significantly higher than the previous independent estimate. Based on the hypothesis that some application stores have a greater density of malicious applications and that advertising within applications and cross-promotional deals may act as infection vectors, we investigate whether the set of applications used on a device can serve as an indicator for infection of that device. Our analysis indicates that, while not an accurate indicator of infection by itself, the application set does serve as an inexpensive method for identifying the pool of devices on which more expensive monitoring and analysis mechanisms should be deployed. Using our two malware datasets we show that this indicator performs up to about five times better at identifying infected devices than the baseline of random checks. Such indicators can be used, for example, in the search for new or previously undetected malware. It is therefore a technique that can complement standard malware scanning. Our analysis also demonstrates a marginally significant difference in battery use between infected and clean devices."

Zubair Rafique, ","URL shortening services facilitate the need of exchanging long URLs using limited space, by creating compact URL aliases that redirect users to the original URLs when followed. Some of these services show advertisements (ads) to link-clicking users and pay a commission of their advertising earnings to link-shortening users."

Neves, Miguel Correia, ","Web application security is an important problem in today's internet. A major cause of this status is that many programmers do not have adequate knowledge about secure coding, so they leave applications with vulnerabilities. An approach to solve this problem is to use source code static analysis to find these bugs, but these tools are known to report many false positives that make hard the task of correcting the application. This paper explores the use of a hybrid of methods to detect vulnerabilities with less false positives. After an initial step that uses taint analysis to flag candidate vulnerabilities, our approach uses data mining to predict the existence of false positives. This approach reaches a trade-off between two apparently opposite approaches: humans coding the knowledge about vulnerabilities (for taint analysis) versus automatically obtaining that knowledge (with machine learning, for data mining). Given this more precise form of detection, we do automatic code correction by inserting fixes in the source code. The approach was implemented in the WAP tool and an experimental evaluation was performed with a large set of open source PHP applications."
www,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2566486.2567991,Personalized collaborative clustering,"Yisong Yue, Chong Wang, Khalid El-Arini, Carlos Guestrin, ","We study the problem of learning personalized user models from rich user interactions. In particular, we focus on learning from clustering feedback (i.e., grouping recommended items into clusters), which enables users to express similarity or redundancy between different items. We propose and study a new machine learning problem for personalization, which we call collaborative clustering. Analogous to collaborative filtering, in collaborative clustering the goal is to leverage how existing users cluster or group items in order to predict similarity models for other users' clustering tasks. We propose a simple yet effective latent factor model to learn the variability of similarity functions across a user population. We empirically evaluate our approach using data collected from a clustering interface we developed for a goal-oriented data exploration (or sensemaking) task: asking users to explore and organize attractions in Paris. We evaluate using several realistic use cases, and show that our approach learns more effective user models than conventional clustering and metric learning approaches."

Collaborative filtering approaches to recommendation systems typically assume that the rating matrix (e.g., movie ratings by viewers) is low-rank. In this paper, we examine an alternative approach in which the rating matrix is locally low-rank. Concretely, we assume that the rating matrix is low-rank within certain neighborhoods of the metric space defined by (user, item) pairs. We combine a recent approach for local low-rank approximation based on the Frobenius norm with a general empirical risk minimization for ranking losses. Our experiments indicate that the combination of a mixture of local low-rank matrices each of which was trained to minimize a ranking loss outperforms many of the currently used state-of-the-art recommendation systems. Moreover, our method is easy to parallelize, making it a viable approach for large scale real-world rank-based recommendation systems."

Smola, ","Given a large dataset of users' ratings of movies, what is the best model to accurately predict which movies a person will like? And how can we prevent spammers from tricking our algorithms into suggesting a bad movie? Is it possible to infer structure between movies simultaneously? In this paper we describe a unified Bayesian approach to Collaborative Filtering that accomplishes all of these goals. It models the discrete structure of ratings and is flexible to the often non-Gaussian shape of the distribution. Additionally, our method finds a co-clustering of the users and items, which improves the model's accuracy and makes the model robust to fraud. We offer three main contributions: (1) We provide a novel model and Gibbs sampling algorithm that accurately models the quirks of real world ratings, such as convex ratings distributions. (2) We provide proof of our model's robustness to spam and anomalous behavior. (3) We use several real world datasets to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting user's ratings, avoiding prediction skew in the face of injected spam, and finding interesting patterns in real world ratings data."

In this paper we introduce the Odd Sketch, a compact binary sketch for estimating the Jaccard similarity of two sets. The exclusive-or of two sketches equals the sketch of the symmetric difference of the two sets. This means that Odd Sketches provide a highly space-efficient estimator for sets of high similarity, which is relevant in applications such as web duplicate detection, collaborative filtering, and association rule learning. The method extends to weighted Jaccard similarity, relevant e.g. for TF-IDF vector comparison. We present a theoretical analysis of the quality of estimation to guarantee the reliability of Odd Sketch-based estimators. Our experiments confirm this efficiency, and demonstrate the efficiency of Odd Sketches in comparison with $b$-bit minwise hashing schemes on association rule learning and web duplicate detection tasks."

Jose, Mounia Lalmas, ","Traditional search systems generally present a ranked list of documents as answers to user queries. In aggregated search systems, results from different and increasingly diverse verticals (image, video, news, etc.) are returned to users. For instance, many such search engines return to users both images and web documents as answers to the query ""flower"". Aggregated search has become a very popular paradigm. In this paper, we go one step further and study a different search paradigm: composite retrieval. Rather than returning and merging results from different verticals, as is the case with aggregated search, we propose to return to users a set of ""bundles"", where a bundle is composed of ""cohesive"" results from several verticals. For example, for the query ""London Olympic"", one bundle per sport could be returned, each containing results extracted from news, videos, images, or Wikipedia. Composite retrieval can promote exploratory search in a way that helps users understand the diversity of results available for a specific query and decide what to explore in more detail. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a variety of approaches to construct bundles that are relevant, cohesive and diverse. Compared with three baselines (traditional ""general web only"" ranking, federated search ranking and aggregated search), our evaluation results demonstrate significant performance improvement for a highly heterogeneous web collection."

Golbus, Imed Zitouni, Jin Young Kim, Ahmed Hassan, Fernando Diaz, ","Document-level relevance judgments are a major component in the calculation of effectiveness metrics. Collecting high-quality judgments is therefore a critical step in information retrieval evaluation. However, the nature of and the assumptions underlying relevance judgment collection have not received much attention. In particular, relevance judgments are typically collected for each document in isolation, although users read each document in the context of other documents. In this work, we aim to investigate the nature of relevance judgment collection. We collect relevance labels in both isolated and conditional setting, and ask for judgments in various dimensions of relevance as well as overall relevance. Then we compare the relevance metrics based on various types of judgments with other metrics of quality such as user preference. Our analyses illuminate how these settings for judgment collection affect the quality and the characteristics of the judgments. We also find that the metrics based on conditional judgments show higher correlation with user preference than isolated judgments."

Ipeirotis, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, ","We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them. Quizz operates by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the user's competence. To acquire new knowledge, Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not have a known answer; the answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to the advertisingsystem about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism to further optimize ad placement."

Prior work has focused on modeling the reliability of individual workers, for instance, by way of confusion matrices, and using these latent traits to estimate the true labels more accurately. However, this strategy becomes ineffective when there are too few labels per worker to reliably estimate their quality. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel community-based Bayesian label aggregation model, CommunityBCC, which assumes that crowd workers conform to a few different types, where each type represents a group of workers with similar confusion matrices. We assume that each worker belongs to a certain community, where the worker's confusion matrix is similar to (a perturbation of) the community's confusion matrix. Our model can then learn a set of key latent features: (i) the confusion matrix of each community, (ii) the community membership of each user, and (iii) the aggregated label of each item. We compare the performance of our model against established aggregation methods on a number of large-scale, real-world crowdsourcing datasets. Our experimental results show that our CommunityBCC model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art label aggregation methods, requiring, on average, 50% less data to pass the 90% accuracy mark."
www,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2566486.2568033,The wisdom of minority: discovering and targeting the right group of workers for crowdsourcing,"Hongwei Li, Bo Zhao, Ariel Fuxman, ","Worker reliability is a longstanding issue in crowdsourcing, and the automatic discovery of high quality workers is an important practical problem. Most previous work on this problem mainly focuses on estimating the quality of each individual worker jointly with the true answer of each task. However, in practice, for some tasks, worker quality could be associated with some explicit characteristics of the worker, such as education level, major and age. So the following question arises: how do we automatically discover related worker attributes for a given task, and further utilize the findings to improve data quality? In this paper, we propose a general crowd targeting framework that can automatically discover, for a given task, if any group of workers based on their attributes have higher quality on average; and target such groups, if they exist, for future work on the same task. Our crowd targeting framework is complementary to traditional worker quality estimation approaches. Furthermore, an advantage of our framework is that it is more budget efficient because we are able to target potentially good workers before they actually do the task. Experiments on real datasets show that the accuracy of final prediction can be improved significantly for the same budget (or even less budget in some cases). Our framework can be applied to many real word tasks and can be easily integrated in current crowdsourcing platforms."

However, releasing private user data to the greater public would concern web users about their privacy, especially after the incident of AOL search log release where anonymization was not correctly done. In this paper, we adopt differential privacy, a strong, provable privacy definition, and show that differentially private aggregates of web browsing activities can be released in real-time while preserving the utility of shared data. Our proposed algorithms utilize the rich correlation of the time series of aggregated data and adopt a state-space approach to estimate the underlying, true aggregates from the perturbed values by the differential privacy mechanism. We evaluate our algorithms with real-world web browsing data. Utility evaluations with three metrics demonstrate that the quality of the private, released data by our solutions closely resembles that of the original, unperturbed aggregates."

In existing approaches, all such defenses ultimately rely on client-side heuristics to automatically detect cookies containing session information, to then protect them against theft or otherwise unintended use. While clearly crucial to the effectiveness of the resulting defense mechanisms, these heuristics have not, as yet, undergone any rigorous assessment of their adequacy. In this paper, we conduct the first such formal assessment, based on a gold set of cookies we collect from 70 popular websites of the Alexa ranking. To obtain the gold set, we devise a semi-automatic procedure that draws on a novel notion of authentication token, which we introduce to capture multiple web authentication schemes. We test existing browser-based defenses in the literature against our gold set, unveiling several pitfalls both in the heuristics adopted and in the methods used to assess them. We then propose a new detection method based on supervised learning, where our gold set is used to train a binary classifier, and report on experimental evidence that our method outperforms existing proposals. Interestingly, the resulting classification, together with our hands-on experience in the construction of the gold set, provides new insight on how web authentication is implemented in practice."

Many of these APIs involve accessing sensitive functionality and/or user data and require approval by users. Android for instance allows developers to select from over 130 possible permissions. Expecting users to review and possibly adjust settings related to these permissions has proven unrealistic. In this paper, we report on the results of a study analyzing people's privacy preferences when it comes to granting permissions to different mobile apps. Our results suggest that, while people's mobile app privacy preferences are diverse, a relatively small number of profiles can be identified that offer the promise of significantly simplifying the decisions mobile users have to make. Specifically, our results are based on the analysis of settings of 4.8 million smartphone users of a mobile security and privacy platform. The platform relies on a rooted version of Android where users are allowed to choose between ""granting"", ""denying"" or ""requesting to be dynamically prompted"" when it comes to granting 12 different Android permissions to mobile apps they have downloaded."

Quantifying the statistical surprise in the arrangement of the edges of the network has led to simple and powerful algorithms. However, relying solely on the distribution of edges instead of more complex structures such as paths limits the extent of modularity. Indeed, recent studies have shown restrictions of optimizing modularity, for instance its resolution limit. We introduce here a novel, formal and well-defined modularity measure based on random walks. We show how this modularity can be computed from paths induced by the graph instead of the traditionally used edges. We argue that by computing modularity on paths instead of edges, more informative features can be extracted from the network. We verify this hypothesis on a semi-supervised classification procedure of the nodes in the network, where we show that, under the same settings, the features of the random walk modularity help to classify better than the features of the usual modularity. Additionally, the proposed approach outperforms the classical label propagation procedure on two data sets of labeled social networks."

To the best of our knowledge, these methods are the first practical exact indexing methods to efficiently process distance queries and dynamic graph updates. We first propose a dynamic indexing scheme for queries on the last snapshot. The scalability and efficiency of its offline indexing algorithm and query algorithm are competitive even with previous static methods. Meanwhile, the method is dynamic, that is, it can incrementally update indices as the graph changes over time. Then, we further design another dynamic indexing scheme that can also answer two kinds of historical queries with regard to not only the latest snapshot but also previous snapshots."

In Kiva.org, a widely-used crowd-funded micro-financial service, a vast amount of micro-financial activities are done by lending teams, and thus, understanding their diverse characteristics is crucial in maintaining a healthy micro-finance ecosystem. As the first step for this goal, we model different lending teams by using a maximum-entropy distribution approach based on a wealthy set of heterogeneous information regarding micro-financial transactions available at Kiva. Based on this approach, we achieved a competitive performance in predicting the lending activities for the top 200 teams. Furthermore, we provide deep insight about the characteristics of lending teams by analyzing the resulting team-specific lending models. We found that lending teams are generally more careful in selecting loans by a loan's geo-location, a borrower's gender, a field partner's reliability, etc., when compared to lenders without team affiliations. In addition, we identified interesting lending behaviors of different lending teams based on lenders' background and interest such as their ethnic, religious, linguistic, educational, regional, and occupational aspects. Finally, using our proposed model, we tackled a novel problem of lending team recommendation and showed its promising performance results."

Nowadays, they have an additional option: that of crowdfunding. The name refers to the idea that funds come from a network of people on the Internet who are passionate about supporting others' projects. One of the most popular crowdfunding sites is Kickstarter. In it, creators post descriptions of their projects and advertise them on social media sites (mainly Twitter), while investors look for projects to support. The most common reason for project failure is the inability of founders to connect with a sufficient number of investors, and that is mainly because hitherto there has not been any automatic way of matching creators and investors. We thus set out to propose different ways of recommending investors found on Twitter for specific Kickstarter projects. We do so by conducting hypothesis-driven analyses of pledging behavior and translate the corresponding findings into different recommendation strategies. The best strategy achieves, on average, 84% of accuracy in predicting a list of potential investors' Twitter accounts for any given project. Our findings also produced key insights about the whys and wherefores of investors deciding to support innovative efforts."

The roots of homophily can be subtle and are mainly traced back to two mechanisms: (i) social selection and (ii) peer influence. Decomposing the effects of each of these mechanisms requires analysis of longitudinal data. This has been a burden to similar studies in traditional social sciences due to the hardness of collecting such information. However, the proliferation of online social media has enabled the collection of massive amounts of information related with human activities. In this work, we are interested in examining the forces of the above mechanisms in the context of the locations visited by people. For our study, we use a longitudinal dataset collected from Gowalla, a location-based social network (LBSN). LBSNs, unlike other online social media, bond users' online interactions with their activities in real-world, physical locations. Prior work on LBSNs has focused on the influence of geographical constraints on the formation of social ties. On the contrary, in this paper, we perform a microscopic study of the peer influence and social selection mechanisms in LBSNs. Our analysis indicates that while the similarity of friends' spatial trails at a geographically global scale cannot be attributed to peer influence, the latter can explain up to 40% of the geographically localized similarity between friends. Moreover, this percentage depends on the type of locations we examine, and it can be even higher for specific categories (e.g., nightlife spots). Finally, we find that the social selection mechanism, is only triggered by places that exhibit specific network characteristics. We believe that our work can have significant implications on obtaining a deeper understanding of the way that people create friendships, act and move in real space, which can further facilitate and enhance applications such as recommender systems, trip planning and marketing."

Bernstein, ","Online experiments are widely used to compare specific design alternatives, but they can also be used to produce generalizable knowledge and inform strategic decision making. Doing so often requires sophisticated experimental designs, iterative refinement, and careful logging and analysis. Few tools exist that support these needs. We thus introduce a language for online field experiments called PlanOut. PlanOut separates experimental design from application code, allowing the experimenter to concisely describe experimental designs, whether common ""A/B tests"" and factorial designs, or more complex designs involving conditional logic or multiple experimental units. These latter designs are often useful for understanding causal mechanisms involved in user behaviors.

We believe that when users search for local businesses, such as bars or restaurants, they need to know more about the ambience of each business, such as how crowded it is, how loud and of what type the music it plays is, as well as how loud the human chatter in the business is. Unfortunately, this information doesn't exist today. In this paper, we propose to automatically crowdsource such rich, local business ambience metadata through real user check-in events. Every time a user checks into a business, the phone is in user's hands, and the phone's sensors can sense the business environment. We leverage the phone's microphone during this time to infer the occupancy and human chatter levels, the music type, as well as the music and noise levels in the business. As people check-in to businesses throughout the day, business metadata can be automatically updated over time, enabling a new generation of local search experience. Using approximately 150 audio traces collected from real businesses of various types over a period of 3 months, we show that by properly extracting the temporal and frequency signatures of the audio signal, it is feasible to train models that can simultaneously infer occupancy, human chatter, music, and noise levels in a business, with higher than 79% accuracy."

A number of websites offer friend-finding features that help users bootstrap social networks on the website by copying links from an established network like Facebook or Twitter. This paper quantifies the extent to which such social bootstrapping is effective in enhancing a social experience of the website. First, we develop a stylised analytical model that suggests that copying tends to produce a giant connected component (i.e., a connected community) quickly and preserves properties such as reciprocity and clustering, up to a linear multiplicative factor. Second, we use data from two websites, Pinterest and Last.fm, to empirically compare the subgraph of links copied from Facebook to links created natively. We find that the copied subgraph has a giant component, higher reciprocity and clustering, and confirm that the copied connections see higher social interactions. However, the need for copying diminishes as users become more active and influential. Such users tend to create links natively on the website, to users who are more similar to them than their Facebook friends. Our findings give new insights into understanding how bootstrapping from established social networks can help engage new users by enhancing social interactivity."

Lauw, ","Personalization, or customizing the experience of each individual user, is seen as a useful way to navigate the huge variety of choices on the Web today. A key tenet of personalization is the capacity to model user preferences. The paradigm has shifted from that of individual preferences, whereby we look at a user's past activities alone, to that of shared preferences, whereby we model the similarities in preferences between pairs of users (e.g., friends, people with similar interests). However, shared preferences are still too granular, because it assumes that a pair of users would share preferences across all items. We therefore postulate the need to pay attention to ""context"", which refers to the specific item on which the preferences between two users are to be estimated. In this paper, we propose a generative model for contextual agreement in preferences. For every triplet consisting of two users and an item, the model estimates both the prior probability of agreement between the two users, as well as the posterior probability of agreement with respect to the item at hand. The model parameters are estimated from ratings data. To extend the model to unseen ratings, we further propose several matrix factorization techniques focused on predicting agreement, rather than ratings. Experiments on real-life data show that our model yields context-specific similarity values that perform better on a prediction task than models relying on shared preferences."

Although many models and algorithms have been proposed, how to make accurate prediction for new users with extremely few rating records still remains a big challenge, which is called the cold start problem. Many existing methods utilize additional information, such as social graphs, to cope with the cold start problem. However, the side information may not always be available. In contrast to such methods, we propose a more general solution to address the cold start problem based on the observed user rating records only. Specifically we define a random walk on a bipartite graph of users and items to simulate the preference propagation among users, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem for cold start users. Then we propose a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the similarity between different users. This algorithm takes a precomputation approach, and thus can efficiently compute the user similarity given any new user for rating prediction. In addition, our algorithm can easily handle dynamic updates and can be parallelized naturally, which are crucial for large recommendation systems. Theoretical analysis is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, and extensive experiments also confirm our theoretical findings."

In this paper, we explore how users respond to this question and find that their responses are not quite straightforward after all. Using data from Amazon product reviews, we present evidence that users do not make absolute, independent voting decisions based on individual review quality alone. Rather, whether users vote at all, as well as the polarity of their vote for any given review, depends on the context in which they view it - reviews receive a larger overall number of votes when they are 'misranked', and the polarity of votes becomes more positive/negative when the review is ranked lower/higher than it deserves. We distill these empirical findings into a new probabilistic model of rating behavior that includes the dependence of rating decisions on context. Understanding and formally modeling voting behavior is crucial for designing learning mechanisms and algorithms for review ranking, and we conjecture that many of our findings also apply to user behavior in other online content-rating settings."

The problem has several real-world applications, including identifying competing advertisers and suggesting related queries in an online advertising system or finding users with similar interests and suggesting content to them. In these settings, we are interested in computing on-the-fly rankings of similar actors, given an actor and an arbitrary subset of categories of interest. Two main challenges arise: First, the bipartite graphs are huge and often lopsided (e.g. the system might receive billions of queries while presenting only millions of advertisers). Second, the sheer number of possible combinations of categories prevents the pre-computation of the results for all of them. We present a novel algorithmic framework that addresses both issues for the computation of several graph-theoretical similarity measures, including # common neighbors, and Personalized PageRank. We show how to tackle the imbalance in the graphs to speed up the computation and provide efficient real-time algorithms for computing rankings for an arbitrary subset of categories. Finally, we show experimentally the accuracy of our approach with real-world data, using both public graphs and a very large dataset from Google AdWords."

Since these ratings are rather static but might change over time, a temporal analysis of rating distributions provides deeper insights into the evolution of a products' quality. Given a time-series of rating distributions, in this work, we answer the following questions: (1) How to detect the base behavior of users regarding a product's evaluation over time? (2) How to detect points in time where the rating distribution differs from this base behavior, e.g., due to attacks or spontaneous changes in the product's quality? To achieve these goals, we model the base behavior of users regarding a product as a latent multivariate autoregressive process. This latent behavior is mixed with a sparse anomaly signal finally leading to the observed data. We propose an efficient algorithm solving our objective and we present interesting findings on various real world datasets."

Recent studies in psychology suggest that novelty-seeking trait is highly related to consumer behavior. In this paper, we focus on understanding individual novelty-seeking trait embodied at different levels and across heterogeneous domains. Unlike the questionnaire-based methods widely adopted in the past, we first present a computational framework, Novel Seeking Model (NSM), for exploring the novelty-seeking trait implied by observable activities. Then, we explore the novelty-seeking trait in two heterogeneous domains: check-in behavior in location based social networks, which reflects mobility patterns in the physical world, and online shopping behavior on e-commerce sites, which reflects consumption concepts in economic activities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of NSM, we conducted extensive experiments, with a large dataset covering the two-domain activities for hundreds of thousands of individuals. Our results suggest that NSM offers a powerful paradigm for 1) presenting an effective measurement of a personality trait that can explicitly explain the deviation of individuals from the habits of individuals and crowds; 2) uncovering the correlation of novelty-seeking trait at different levels and across heterogeneous domains. The proposed method provides emerging implications for personalized cross-domain recommendation and targeted advertising."

However, this knowledge can never be complete due to the dynamics of the ever-changing world: new companies are formed every day, new songs are composed every minute and become of interest for addition to a KB. To keep up with the real world's entities, the KB maintenance process needs to continuously discover newly emerging entities in news and other Web streams. In this paper we focus on the most difficult case where the names of new entities are ambiguous. This raises the technical problem to decide whether an observed name refers to a known entity or represents a new entity. This paper presents a method to solve this problem with high accuracy. It is based on a new model of measuring the confidence of mapping an ambiguous mention to an existing entity, and a new model of representing a new entity with the same ambiguous name as a set of weighted keyphrases. The method can handle both Wikipedia-derived entities that typically constitute the bulk of large KB's as well as entities that exist only in other Web sources such as online communities about music or movies. Experiments show that our entity discovery method outperforms previous methods for coping with out-of-KB entities (called unlinkable in entity linking)."

While recent NER systems can achieve near-human performance on certain documents like news articles, they still remain highly domain-specific and thus cannot effectively identify entities such as original technical concepts in scientific documents. In this work, we propose novel approaches for NER on distinctive document collections (such as scientific articles) based on n-grams inspection and classification. We design and evaluate several entity recognition features---ranging from well-known part-of-speech tags to n-gram co-location statistics and decision trees---to classify candidates. In addition, we show how the use of external knowledge bases (either specific like DBLP or generic like DBPedia) can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of NER for idiosyncratic collections. We evaluate our system on two test collections created from a set of Computer Science and Physics papers and compare it against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Experimental results show that a careful combination of the features we propose yield up to 85% NER accuracy over scientific collections and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as those based on maximum entropy."

For example, the pairs ""Newpark Mall Gap Outlet"" and ""Newpark Mall Sears Outlet"" have a high string similarity, but determining that they are different requires the domain knowledge that they represent two different store names in the same mall. Similarly, in most parts of the world, a local business called ""Central Park Cafe"" might simply be referred to by ""Central Park"", except in New York, where the keyword ""Cafe"" in the name becomes important to differentiate it from the famous park in the city."

We study theoretical properties of this model, develop algorithms to learn reconsumption likelihood as a function of t, and show a strong fit of the resulting inferred function via a power law with exponential cutoff. We then introduce a notion of item quality, show that it alone underperforms our recency-based model, and develop a hybrid model that predicts user choice based on a combination of recency and quality.

Based on these insights, we develop models to accurately estimate when multiple people contribute to the logs ascribed to a single machine identifier. We also develop models to cluster search behavior on a machine, allowing us to attribute historical data accurately and automatically assign new search activity to the correct searcher. The findings have implications for the design of applications such as personalized search and advertising that rely heavily on machine identifiers to custom-tailor their services."

However, little is known about the dynamics behind participation in these online communities and how the recommendations in these communities are formed. In this work, we take a first look at online restaurant recommendation communities to study what endogenous (i.e., related to entities being reviewed) and exogenous factors influence people's participation in the communities, and to what extent. We analyze an online community corpus of 840K restaurants and their 1.1M associated reviews from 2002 to 2011, spread across every U.S. state. We construct models for number of reviews and ratings by community members, based on several dimensions of endogenous and exogenous factors. We find that while endogenous factors such as restaurant attributes (e.g., meal, price, service) affect recommendations, surprisingly, exogenous factors such as demographics (e.g., neighborhood diversity, education) and weather (e.g., temperature, rain, snow, season) also exert a significant effect on reviews. We find that many of the effects in online communities can be explained using offline theories from experimental psychology. Our study is the first to look at exogenous factors and how it related to online online restaurant reviews. It has implications for designing online recommendation sites, and in general, social media and online communities."

Nallapati, ","Web searches are increasingly formulated as natural language questions, rather than keyword queries. Retrieving answers to such questions requires a degree of understanding of user expectations. An important step in this direction is to automatically infer the type of answer implied by the question, e.g., factoids, statements on a topic, instructions, reviews, etc. Answer Type taxonomies currently exist for factoid-style questions, but not for open-domain questions. Building taxonomies for non-factoid questions is a harder problem since these questions can come from a very broad semantic space. A few attempts have been made to develop taxonomies for non-factoid questions, but these tend to be too narrow or domain specific. In this paper, we address this problem by modeling the Answer Type as a latent variable that is learned in a data-driven fashion, allowing the model to be more adaptive to new domains and data sets. We propose approaches that detect the relevance of candidate answers to a user question by jointly 'clustering' questions according to the hidden variable, and modeling relevance conditioned on this hidden variable."

Yet despite their seemingly huge size, these knowledge bases are greatly incomplete. For example, over 70% of people included in Freebase have no known place of birth, and 99% have no known ethnicity. In this paper, we propose a way to leverage existing Web-search-based question-answering technology to fill in the gaps in knowledge bases in a targeted way. In particular, for each entity attribute, we learn the best set of queries to ask, such that the answer snippets returned by the search engine are most likely to contain the correct value for that attribute. For example, if we want to find Frank Zappa's mother, we could ask the query `who is the mother of Frank Zappa'. However, this is likely to return `The Mothers of Invention', which was the name of his band. Our system learns that it should (in this case) add disambiguating terms, such as Zappa's place of birth, in order to make it more likely that the search results contain snippets mentioning his mother. Our system also learns how many different queries to ask for each attribute, since in some cases, asking too many can hurt accuracy (by introducing false positives). We discuss how to aggregate candidate answers across multiple queries, ultimately returning probabilistic predictions for possible values for each attribute. Finally, we evaluate our system and show that it is able to extract a large number of facts with high confidence."

It is a common assumption of most topic models that a document is generated from a mixture of topics. In real-world scenarios, individual documents usually concentrate on several salient topics instead of covering a wide variety of topics. A real topic also adopts a narrow range of terms instead of a wide coverage of the vocabulary. Understanding this sparsity of information is especially important for analyzing user-generated Web content and social media, which are featured as extremely short posts and condensed discussions. In this paper, we propose a dual-sparse topic model that addresses the sparsity in both the topic mixtures and the word usage. By applying a ""Spike and Slab"" prior to decouple the sparsity and smoothness of the document-topic and topic-word distributions, we allow individual documents to select a few focused topics and a topic to select focused terms, respectively. Experiments on different genres of large corpora demonstrate that the dual-sparse topic model outperforms both classical topic models and existing sparsity-enhanced topic models.

In this work, we propose an automated approach based on a genetic algorithm to calculate the recovery plan that could guarantee the satisfaction of functional properties of the composite service after recovery. Given a composite service with large state space, the proposed method does not require exploring the full state space of the composite service; therefore, it allows efficient selection of recovery plan. In addition, the selection of recovery plans is based on their quality of service (QoS). A QoS-optimal recovery plan allows effective recovery from the state of failure.

We deploy our crawler over a variety of websites and profiles and this yields over 175K distinct display ads. We find that while targeting is widely used, there remain many instances in which delivered ads do not depend on user profile; further, ads vary more over user profiles than over websites. We also assess the population of advertisers seen and identify over 3.7K distinct entities from a variety of business segments. Finally, we find that when targeting is used, the specific types of ads delivered generally correspond with the details of user profiles, and also on users' patterns of visit."

A/B Testing support decision making by directly comparing two variants at a time. It can be used for comparison between (1) two candidate treatments and (2) a candidate treatment and an established control. In practice, one typically runs an experiment with multiple treatments together with a control to make decision for both purposes simultaneously. This is known to have two issues. First, having multiple treatments increases false positives due to multiple comparison. Second, the selection process causes an upward bias in estimated effect size of the best observed treatment. To overcome these two issues, a two stage process is recommended, in which we select the best treatment from the first screening stage and then run the same experiment with only the selected best treatment and the control in the validation stage. Traditional application of this two-stage design often focus only on results from the second stage. In this paper, we propose a general methodology for combining the first screening stage data together with validation stage data for more sensitive hypothesis testing and more accurate point estimation of the treatment effect. Our method is widely applicable to existing online controlled experimentation systems."

The goal of the research was to understand users' strategies in making bids. We studied the behavior under two auction types: (1) the Generalized Second-Price (GSP) auction and (2) the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves (VCG) payment rule, and manipulated also the participants' knowledge conditions: (1) explicitly given valuations and (2) payoff information from which valuations could be deduced. We found several interesting behaviors, among them are: No convergence to equilibrium was detected; moreover the frequency with which participants modified their bids increased with time. We can detect explicit ""better-response"" behavior rather than just mixed bidding. While bidders in GSP auctions do strategically shade their bids, they tend to bid higher than theoretically predicted by the standard VCG-like equilibrium of GSP. Bidders who are not explicitly given their valuations but can only deduce them from their gains behave a little less ""precisely"" than those with such explicit knowledge, but mostly during an initial learning phase. VCG and GSP yield approximately the same (high) social welfare, but GSP tends to give higher revenue."

Stack Overflow has explicit, detailed guidelines on how to post questions and an ebullient moderation community. Despite these precise communications and safeguards, questions posted on Stack Overflow can be extremely off topic or very poor in quality. Such questions can be deleted from Stack Overflow at the discretion of experienced community members and moderators. We present the first study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow. We divide our study into two parts - (i) Characterization of deleted questions over ~5 years (2008-2013) of data, (ii) Prediction of deletion at the time of question creation. Our characterization study reveals multiple insights on question deletion phenomena. We find that it takes substantial time to vote a question to be deleted but once voted, the community takes swift action. We also see that question authors delete their questions to salvage reputation points. We notice some instances of accidental deletion of good quality questions but such questions are voted back to be undeleted quickly. We discover a pyramidal structure of question quality on Stack Overflow and find that deleted questions lie at the bottom (lowest quality) of the pyramid. We also build a predictive model to detect the deletion of question at the creation time. We experiment with 47 features -- based on User Profile, Community Generated, Question Content and Syntactic style -- and report an accuracy of 66%. Our findings reveal important suggestions for content quality maintenance on community based question answering websites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study on poor quality (deleted) questions on Stack Overflow."

To further extract these types of topics, we introduce a non-parametric multi-level Dirichlet Process model to recognize four types of tweets: personal time-specific (PersonTS), personal time-general (PersonTG), public time-specific (PublicTS) and pub- lic time-general (PublicTG) topics, which, in turn, are used for fur- ther personal event extraction and timeline generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focused on the generation of timeline for individuals from Twitter data.

These highly visible online success stories, however, overshadow an untold number of similar ventures that fail. The study of website popularity is ultimately incomplete without general mechanisms that can describe both successes and failures. In this work we present six years of the daily number of users (DAU) of twenty-two membership-based websites - encompassing online social networks, grassroots movements, online forums, and membership-only Internet stores - well balanced between successes and failures. We then propose a combination of reaction-diffusion-decay processes whose resulting equations seem not only to describe well the observed DAU time series but also provide means to roughly predict their evolution. This model allows an approximate automatic DAU-based classification of websites into self-sustainable v.s. unsustainable and whether the startup growth is mostly driven by marketing & media campaigns or word-of-mouth adoptions."

We introduce the concept of word storms, a visualization tool for analyzing corpora of documents. A word storm is a group of word clouds, in which each cloud represents a single document, juxtaposed to allow the viewer to compare and contrast the documents. We present a novel algorithm that creates a coordinated word storm, in which words that appear in multiple documents are placed in the same location, using the same color and orientation, across clouds. This ensures that similar documents are represented by similar-looking word clouds, making them easier to compare and contrast visually. We evaluate the algorithm using an automatic evaluation based on document classification, and a user study. The results confirm that a coordinated word storm allows for better visual comparison of documents."

Maxwell Harper, Loren Terveen, ","Eli Pariser coined the term 'filter bubble' to describe the potential for online personalization to effectively isolate people from a diversity of viewpoints or content. Online recommender systems - built on algorithms that attempt to predict which items users will most enjoy consuming - are one family of technologies that potentially suffers from this effect. Because recommender systems have become so prevalent, it is important to investigate their impact on users in these terms. This paper examines the longitudinal impacts of a collaborative filtering-based recommender system on users. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to measure the filter bubble effect in terms of content diversity at the individual level. We contribute a novel metric to measure content diversity based on information encoded in user-generated tags, and we present a new set of methods to examine the temporal effect of recommender systems on the user experience. We do find that recommender systems expose users to a slightly narrowing set of items over time. However, we also see evidence that users who actually consume the items recommended to them experience lessened narrowing effects and rate items more positively."

In our model, search providers compete for customers by strategically selecting which search results to display in response to user queries. Customers, in turn, have private preferences over search results and will tend to use search engines that are more likely to display pages satisfying their demands. Our main question is whether competition between search engines increases the overall welfare of the users (i.e., the likelihood that a user finds a page of interest). When search engines derive utility only from customers to whom they show relevant results, we show that they differentiate their results, and every equilibrium of the resulting game achieves at least half of the welfare that could be obtained by a social planner. This bound also applies whenever the likelihood of selecting a given engine is a convex function of the probability that a user's demand will be satisfied, which includes natural Markovian models of user behavior."

A key component of online advertising is the auction mechanism which selects and prices the set of winning ads. This work is inspired by one of the biggest practical drawbacks of the widely popular Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is the unique incentive-compatible mechanism that maximizes social welfare. It is known that VCG lacks a desired property of revenue monotonicity - a natural notion which states that the revenue of a mechanism shouldn't go down as the number of bidders increase or if the bidders increase their bids. Most firms which depend on online advertising revenue have a large sales team to attract more bidders on their inventory as the general belief is that more bidders will increase competition, and hence revenue. However, the lack of revenue monotonicity of VCG conflicts with this general belief and can be strategically confusing for the firm's business."

Huberman, ","One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, users or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources may become semantically stable over time as more and more users tag them. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: (i) How can we assess the semantic stability of social tagging systems in a robust and methodical way? (ii) Does semantic stabilization of tags vary across different social tagging systems and ultimately, (iii) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work we tackle these questions by (i) presenting a novel and robust method which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods, (ii) empirically investigating semantic stabilization processes in a wide range of social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties and (iii) detecting potential causes for semantic stabilization, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams which are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams which are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone."

However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced or extracted data of often relatively low quality. We present a methodology for test-driven quality assessment of Linked Data, which is inspired by test-driven software development. We argue that vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases should be accompanied by a number of test cases, which help to ensure a basic level of quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality problems. Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test case queries. Based on an extensive survey, we compile a comprehensive library of data quality test case patterns. We perform automatic test case instantiation based on schema constraints or semi-automatically enriched schemata and allow the user to generate specific test case instantiations that are applicable to a schema or dataset. We provide an extensive evaluation of five LOD datasets, manual test case instantiation for five schemas and automatic test case instantiations for all available schemata registered with Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV). One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics."

Integrating such meta triples into semantic knowledge bases would enable the querying and reasoning mechanisms to be aware of provenance, time, location, or certainty of triples. However, an efficient RDF representation for such meta knowledge of triples remains challenging. The existing standard reification approach allows such meta knowledge of RDF triples to be expressed using RDF by two steps. The first step is representing the triple by a Statement instance which has subject, predicate, and object indicated separately in three different triples. The second step is creating assertions about that instance as if it is a statement. While reification is simple and intuitive, this approach does not have formal semantics and is not commonly used in practice as described in the RDF Primer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Singleton Property for representing statements about statements and provide a formal semantics for it. We explain how this singleton property approach fits well with the existing syntax and formal semantics of RDF, and the syntax of SPARQL query language. We also demonstrate the use of singleton property in the representation and querying of meta knowledge in two examples of Semantic Web knowledge bases: YAGO2 and BKR. Our experiments on the BKR show that the singleton property approach gives a decent performance in terms of number of triples, query length and query execution time compared to existing approaches. This approach, which is also simple and intuitive, can be easily adopted for representing and querying statements about statements in other knowledge bases."

In our preliminary study of Last.fm, we find that the two data sources extracted from user comments -- the textual comments and the commenting users -- provide complementary evidence to the items' intrinsic features. These sources have varying levels of quality, but we importantly we find that incorporating all three sources improves clustering. To accommodate such quality imbalance, we invoke multi-view clustering, in which each data source represents a view, aiming to best leverage the utility of different views."

Identifying common patterns, or progression stages, in such event sequences is a challenging task because not every individual follows the same evolutionary pattern, stages may have very different lengths, and individuals may progress at different rates. In this paper, we develop a model-based method for discovering common progression stages in general event sequences. We develop a generative model in which each sequence belongs to a class, and sequences from a given class pass through a common set of stages, where each sequence evolves at its own rate. We then develop a scalable algorithm to infer classes of sequences, while also segmenting each sequence into a set of stages. We evaluate our method on event sequences, ranging from patients' medical histories to online news and navigational traces from the Web. The evaluation shows that our methodology can predict future events in a sequence, while also accurately inferring meaningful progression stages, and effectively grouping sequences based on common progression patterns. More generally, our methodology allows us to reason about how event sequences progress over time, by discovering patterns and categories of temporal evolution in large-scale datasets of events."

While there has been a spate of recent work on estimating the number of nodes in a network, the edge-estimation question appears to be largely unaddressed. In this work we consider the problem of estimating the average degree of a large network using efficient random sampling, where the number of nodes is not known to the algorithm. We propose a new estimator for this problem that relies on access to node samples under a prescribed distribution. Next, we show how to efficiently realize this ideal estimator in a random walk setting. Our estimator has a natural and simple implementation using random walks; we bound its performance in terms of the mixing time of the underlying graph. We then show that our estimators are both provably and practically better than many natural estimators for the problem. Our work contrasts with existing theoretical work on estimating average degree, which assume that a uniform random sample of nodes is available and the number of nodes is known."

However, we believe most social ties are natively directed, and the awareness of directionality can improve our understanding about the network structures and further benefit social network analysis and mining tasks. Thus it's appealing to study whether there exist interesting patterns about directionality in social networks and whether we can learn the directions for undirected networks based on these patterns. In this study, we engage in the investigation of directionality patterns on real-world directed social networks and summarize our findings using four consistency hypotheses. Based on these hypotheses, we propose ReDirect, an optimization framework which makes it possible to infer the hidden directions of undirected social ties based on the network topology only. This general framework can incorporate various predictive models under specific scenarios. Furthermore, we show how to improve ReDirect by introducing semi/self-supervision in the framework and how to construct the self-labeled training data using simple but effective heuristics. Experimental results show that even without external information, our approach can recover the directions of networks effectively."

In this paper, we study the problem of profiling user attributes in social network. To capture the correlation between attributes and social connections, we present a new insight that social connections are discriminatively correlated with attributes via a hidden factor -- relationship type. For example, a user's colleagues are more likely to share the same employer with him than other friends. Based on the insight, we propose to co-profile users' attributes and relationship types of their connections. To achieve co-profiling, we develop an efficient algorithm based on an optimization framework. Our algorithm captures our insight effectively. It iteratively profiles attributes by propagation via certain types of connections, and profiles types of connections based on attributes and the network structure. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our algorithm. The results show that our algorithm profiles various attributes accurately, which improves the state-of-the-art methods by 12%."

Pfeiffer, Sebastian Moreno, Timothy La Fond, Jennifer Neville, ","Online social networks have become ubiquitous to today's society and the study of data from these networks has improved our understanding of the processes by which relationships form. Research in statistical relational learning focuses on methods to exploit correlations among the attributes of linked nodes to predict user characteristics with greater accuracy. Concurrently, research on generative graph models has primarily focused on modeling network structure without attributes, producing several models that are able to replicate structural characteristics of networks such as power law degree distributions or community structure. However, there has been little work on how to generate networks with real-world structural properties and correlated attributes. In this work, we present the Attributed Graph Model (AGM) framework to jointly model network structure and vertex attributes. Our framework learns the attribute correlations in the observed network and exploits a generative graph model, such as the Kronecker Product Graph Model (KPGM) and Chung Lu Graph Model (CL), to compute structural edge probabilities. AGM then combines the attribute correlations with the structural probabilities to sample networks conditioned on attribute values, while keeping the expected edge probabilities and degrees of the input graph model. We outline an efficient method for estimating the parameters of AGM, as well as a sampling method based on Accept-Reject sampling to generate edges with correlated attributes. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our AGM framework on two large real-world networks, showing that AGM scales to networks with hundreds of thousands of vertices, as well as having high attribute correlation."

To track authorship of text tokens in such systems has many potential applications; the identification of main authors for licensing reasons or tracing collaborative writing patterns over time, to name some. In this context, two main challenges arise. First, it is critical for such an authorship tracking system to be precise in its attributions, to be reliable for further processing. Second, it has to run efficiently even on very large datasets, such as Wikipedia. As a solution, we propose a graph-based model to represent revisioned content and an algorithm over this model that tackles both issues effectively. We describe the optimal implementation and design choices when tuning it to a Wiki environment. We further present a gold standard of 240 tokens from English Wikipedia articles annotated with their origin. This gold standard was created manually and confirmed by multiple independent users of a crowdsourcing platform. It is the first gold standard of this kind and quality and our solution achieves an average of 95% precision on this data set. We also perform a first-ever precision evaluation of the state-of-the-art algorithm for the task, exceeding it by over 10% on average. Our approach outperforms the execution time of the state-of-the-art by one order of magnitude, as we demonstrate on a sample of over 240 English Wikipedia articles. We argue that the increased size of an optional materialization of our results by about 10% compared to the baseline is a favorable trade-off, given the large advantage in runtime performance."

Manual quality assurance by experts can barely cope with this massive amount of data. Can it be effectively replaced by feedback from the crowd? Can we provide meaningful support for quality assurance with automated text processing techniques? Which properties of the articles should then play a key role in the machine learning algorithms and why? In this paper, we study the user-perceived quality of Wikipedia articles based on a novel Wikipedia user feedback dataset. In contrast to previous work on quality assessment which mostly relied on judgements of active Wikipedia authors, we analyze ratings of ordinary Wikipedia users along four quality dimensions (Complete, Well written, Trustworthy and Objective). We first present an empirical analysis of the novel dataset with over 36 million Wikipedia article ratings. We then select a subset of biographical articles and perform classification experiments to predict their quality ratings along each of the dimensions, exploring multiple linguistic, surface and network properties of the rated articles. Additionally, we study the classification performance and differences for the biographies of living and dead people as well as those for men and women. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by the F-scores of 0.94, 0.89, 0.73, and 0.73 for the dimensions Complete, Well written, Trustworthy, and Objective.

These are some of the questions we address in this work. We investigate two key components of an image that affect its popularity, namely the image content and social context.

In particular, we focus on (i) how social interactions within a group differ from the ones across groups, (ii) what makes a group rise, sustain, or fall, (iii) how group members join and leave a group, and (iv) what makes a group end. We first find that structural patterns of social interactions within a group are more likely to be close-knit and reciprocative than the ones across groups. We also observe that members in a rising group (i.e., the number of members increases) are more cohesive, and communicate with more evenly within the group than the ones in other groups. Our analysis further reveals that if a group is not cohesive, not actively communicating, or not evenly communicating among members, members of the group tend to leave."

Its sponsoring registry proposed it as an expansion of the name space, as well as a way to separate adult from child-appropriate content. Many independent groups, including trademark holders, political groups, and the adult entertainment industry itself, were concerned that it would primarily generate value through defensive and speculative registrations, without actually serving a real need. This paper measures the validity of these concerns using data gathered from ICANN, whois, and Web requests. We use this information to characterize each xxx domain and infer the registrant's most likely intent. We find that at most 3.8% of xxx domains host or redirect to potentially legitimate Web content, with the rest generally serving either defensive or speculative purposes. Indeed, registrants spent roughly $13M up front to defend existing brands and trademarks within the xxx TLD, and an additional $11M over the course of the first year. Additional evidence suggests that over 80% of annual domain registrations are for purely defensive purposes and do not even resolve."

Myers, Jure Leskovec, ","In online social media systems users are not only posting, consuming, and resharing content, but also creating new and destroying existing connections in the underlying social network. While each of these two types of dynamics has individually been studied in the past, much less is known about the connection between the two. How does user information posting and seeking behavior interact with the evolution of the underlying social network structure? Here, we study ways in which network structure reacts to users posting and sharing content. We examine the complete dynamics of the Twitter information network, where users post and reshare information while they also create and destroy connections. We find that the dynamics of network structure can be characterized by steady rates of change, interrupted by sudden bursts. Information diffusion in the form of cascades of post re-sharing often creates such sudden bursts of new connections, which significantly change users' local network structure. We also explore the effect of the information content on the dynamics of the network and find evidence that the appearance of new topics and real-world events can lead to significant changes in edge creations and deletions. Lastly, we develop a model that quantifies the dynamics of the network and the occurrence of these bursts as a function of the information spreading through the network. The model can successfully predict which information diffusion events will lead to bursts in network dynamics."

Alex Dow, Jon Michael Kleinberg, ","On many social networking web sites such as Facebook and Twitter, resharing or reposting functionality allows users to share others' content with their own friends or followers. As content is reshared from user to user, large cascades of reshares can form. While a growing body of research has focused on analyzing and characterizing such cascades, a recent, parallel line of work has argued that the future trajectory of a cascade may be inherently unpredictable. In this work, we develop a framework for addressing cascade prediction problems. On a large sample of photo reshare cascades on Facebook, we find strong performance in predicting whether a cascade will continue to grow in the future. We find that the relative growth of a cascade becomes more predictable as we observe more of its reshares, that temporal and structural features are key predictors of cascade size, and that initially, breadth, rather than depth in a cascade is a better indicator of larger cascades. This prediction performance is robust in the sense that multiple distinct classes of features all achieve similar performance. We also discover that temporal features are predictive of a cascade's eventual shape. Observing independent cascades of the same content, we find that while these cascades differ greatly in size, we are still able to predict which ends up the largest."

Demaine, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, ","We study the power of fractional allocations of resources to maximize our influence in a network. This work extends in a natural way the well-studied model by Kleinberg, Kempe, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a (small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this influence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor influence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes. Despite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this model limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no chance to apply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings precisely, such as exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very relevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new product by distributing five ""20% off"" coupons instead of giving away a single free product."

Recently latent topics in web search data have been found to be critical for a wide range of search engine applications such as search personalization and search history warehousing. However, the existing methods usually discover latent topics from web search data in an offline and retrospective fashion. Hence, they are increasingly ineffective in the face of the ever-increasing web search data that accumulate in the format of online streams. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic topic model, the Web Search Stream Model (WSSM), which is delicately calibrated for handling two salient features of the web search data: it is in the format of streams and in massive volume. We further propose an efficient parameter inference method, the Stream Parameter Inference (SPI) to efficiently train WSSM with massive web search streams. Based on a large-scale search engine query log, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of WSSM and SPI. We observe that WSSM together with SPI discovers latent topics from web search streams faster than the state-of-the-art methods while retaining a comparable topic modeling accuracy."

For example, vertical search engines, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Yelp and Yahoo! Local, provide business category hierarchies for people to navigate through millions of business listings. The category information also provides important ranking features that can be used to improve search experience. However, category hierarchies are often manually crafted by some human experts and they are far from complete. Manually constructed category hierarchies cannot handle the ever-changing and sometimes long-tail user information needs. In this paper, we study the problem of how to expand an existing category hierarchy for a search/navigation system to accommodate the information needs of users more comprehensively. We propose a general framework for this task, which has three steps: 1) detecting meaningful missing categories; 2) modeling the category hierarchy using a hierarchical Dirichlet model and predicting the optimal tree structure according to the model; 3) reorganizing the corpus using the complete category structure, i.e., associating each webpage with the relevant categories from the complete category hierarchy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework generates a high-quality category hierarchy and significantly boosts the retrieval performance."

Jose, ","Query auto-completion (QAC) is a common interactive feature that assists users in formulating queries by providing completion suggestions as they type. In order for QAC to minimise the user's cognitive and physical effort, it must: (i) suggest the user's intended query after minimal input keystrokes, and (ii) rank the user's intended query highly in completion suggestions. Typically, QAC approaches rank completion suggestions by their past popularity. Accordingly, QAC is usually very effective for previously seen and consistently popular queries. Users are increasingly turning to search engines to find out about unpredictable emerging and ongoing events and phenomena, often using previously unseen or unpopular queries. Consequently, QAC must be both robust and time-sensitive -- that is, able to sufficiently rank both consistently and recently popular queries in completion suggestions. To address this trade-off, we propose several practical completion suggestion ranking approaches, including: (i) a sliding window of query popularity evidence from the past 2-28 days, (ii) the query popularity distribution in the last N queries observed with a given prefix, and (iii) short-range query popularity prediction based on recently observed trends. Using real-time simulation experiments, we extensively investigated the parameters necessary to maximise QAC effectiveness for three openly available query log datasets with prefixes of 2-5 characters: MSN and AOL (both English), and Sogou 2008 (Chinese). Optimal parameters vary for each query log, capturing the differing temporal dynamics and querying distributions. Results demonstrate consistent and language-independent improvements of up to 9.2% over a non-temporal QAC baseline for all query logs with prefix lengths of 2-3 characters. This work is an important step towards more effective QAC approaches."
