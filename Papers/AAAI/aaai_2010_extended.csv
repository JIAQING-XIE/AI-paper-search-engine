The propagation is standard, but the Mohc-Revise procedure, used to filter/contract the variable domains w.r.t. an individual constraint, uses monotonic versions of the classical HC4-Revise and BoxNarrow procedures. Mohc-Revise appears to be the first adaptive revise procedure ever proposed in (interval) constraint programming.  Also, when a function is monotonic w.r.t. every variable, Mohc-Revise is proven to compute the optimal/sharpest box enclosing all the solutions of the corresponding constraint (hull consistency). Very promising experimental results suggest that Mohc has the potential to become an alternative to the state-of-the-art HC4 and Box algorithms.",55,"{'interval methods': 1, 'global optimization': 1, 'combinatorial optimization': 1, 'programmation par contraintes': 1, 'intervalles': 1, 'optimisation globale': 1, 'constraint programming': 1}"

The success of these solvers has been theoretically explained by showing that the clause learning framework is an implementation of a proof system which is as poweful as resolution. However, exponential lower bounds are known for resolution, which suggests that significant advances in SAT solving must come from implementations of more powerful proof systems. We present a clause learning SAT solver that uses extended resolution. It is based on a restriction of the application of the extension rule. This solver outperforms existing solvers on application instances from recent SAT competitions as well as on instances that are provably hard for resolution.",75,"{'Constraints': 1, 'SAT': 2, 'SMT': 1, 'CSP': 1, 'QBF': 1, 'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Constraint Satisfaction': 1, 'Boolean Satisfiability': 1, 'Combinatorial Optimization': 1, 'Logic': 1, 'Theorem Proving': 1, 'Diagnostics': 1}"

Loren Toole","Within the electric power literature the transmission expansion planning problem (TNEP) refers to the problem of how to upgrade an electric power network to meet future demands. As this problem is a complex, non-linear, and non-convex optimization problem, researchers have traditionally focused on approximate models of power flows. Existing approaches are often tightly coupled to the approximation choice. Until recently, these approximations have produced results that are straight-forward to adapt to the more complex (real) problem. However, the power grid is evolving towards a state where the adaptations are no longer easy (e.g. large amounts of limited control, renewable generation) that necessitates new optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose a local search variation of the powerful Limited Discrepancy Search (LDLS) that encapsulates the complexity of power flows in a black box that may be queried for information about the quality of a proposed expansion. This allows the development of a new optimization algorithm that is independent of the underlying power model.",15,"{'Operations Research': 1, 'Artificial Intelligence': 1, 'Power Systems': 1, 'Modeling and Simulation': 1}"

Solutions of an AllDifferent constraint can be seen as perfect matchings on the variable/value bipartite graph. Therefore, we investigate the problem of finding simultaneous bipartite matchings. We present an extension of the famous Hall theorem which characterizes when simultaneous bipartite matchings exists. Unfortunately, finding such matchings is NP-hard in general. However, we prove a surprising result that finding a simultaneous matching on a convex bipartite graph takes just polynomial time. Based on this theoretical result, we provide the first polynomial time bound consistency algorithm for the conjunction of two AllDifferent constraints. We identify a pathological problem on which this propagator is exponentially faster compared to existing propagators. Our experiments show that this new propagator can offer significant benefits over existing methods.",17,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 3, 'Constraint Satisfaction': 1, 'Boolean Satisfiability': 1, 'Combinatorial Optimization': 1, 'Optimization': 1}"

We show that the reduction in the number of nodes expanded using multiple independent additive heuristics is the product of the reductions achieved by the individual heuristics. First, we formally state and prove this result on unit edge-cost undirected graphs with a uniform branching factor. Then, we empirically verify it on a model of the 4-peg Towers of Hanoi problem. We also run experiments on the multiple sequence alignment problem showing more general applicability to non-unit edge-cost directed graphs. Then, we extend an existing model to predict the performance of IDA* with a single pattern database to independent additive disjoint pattern databases. This is the first analysis of the performance of independent additive heuristics.",3,{'Artificial Intelligence': 1}

We store the heuristic estimate modulo three, requiring only two bits per entry or in a more compact representation, only 1.6 bits. This allows us to store a pattern database with more entries in the same amount of memory as an uncompressed pattern database. These compression techniques are most useful where lossy compression using cliques or their generalization is not possible or where adjacent entries in the pattern database are not highly correlated. We compare both techniques to the best existing compression methods for the Top-Spin puzzle, Rubik's cube, the 4-peg Towers of Hanoi problem, and the 24 puzzle. Under certain conditions, our best implementations for the Top-Spin puzzle and Rubik's cube outperform the respective state of the art solvers by a factor of four.",22,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 14, 'Heuristic Search': 11, 'Games': 3, 'Machine Learning': 2, 'Deep Learning': 2, 'Automated Planning': 2, 'Knowledge discovery': 2, 'data mining': 2, 'computer animation': 2, 'computer games': 2, 'temporal representation and reasoning': 2, 'Combinatorial Optimisation': 1, 'Frequent Itemset Mining': 1, 'Operations Research': 1}"

However, they are far from satisfactory, especially on hard instances. In this paper, we introduce Edge Weighting Local Search (EWLS), a new local search algorithm for the Minimum Vertex Cover problem. EWLS is based on the idea of extending a partial vertex cover into a vertex cover. A key point of EWLS is to find a vertex set that provides a tight upper bound on the size of the minimum vertex cover. To this purpose, EWLS employs an iterated local search procedure, using an edge weighting scheme which updates edge weights when stuck in local optima. Moreover, some sophisticated search strategies have been taken to improve the quality of local optima. Experimental results on the broadly used DIMACS benchmark show that EWLS is competitive with the current best heuristic algorithms, and outperforms them on hard instances. Furthermore, on a suite of difficult benchmarks, EWLS delivers the best results and sets a new record on the largest instance.",58,"{'Satisfiability': 1, 'Constraint Solving': 1, 'Combinatorial Optimization': 1, 'Heuristic Search': 1, 'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Logic': 1, 'Algorithm': 1}"

The agent does not initially know which roads can be used. However, it knows a probability distribution for the weather, and it can observe the status of roads incident to its location. The objective is to find a policy with low expected travel cost.
We introduce and compare several algorithms for the stochastic CTP. Unlike the optimistic approach most commonly considered in the literature, the new approaches we propose take uncertainty into account explicitly. We show that this property enables them to generate policies of much higher quality than the optimistic one, both theoretically and experimentally.",74,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Classical Planning': 1, 'Probabilistic Planning': 1, 'MDPs': 1, 'Reinforcement Learning': 1}"

However, the results in practice often fall far short of expectations. We introduce a new bidirectional search algorithm, Single-Frontier Bidirectional Searc (SFBDS). Unlike traditional BDS which keeps two frontiers, SFBDS uses a single frontier. Each node in the tree can be seen as an independent task of finding the shortest path between the current start and current goal. At a particular node we can decide to search from start to goal or from goal to start, choosing the direction with the highest potential for minimizing the total work done.

More precisely,given an arc weighted tournament T on n vertices and a feedback arc set F (a set of arcs whose deletion from T turns it into a directed acyclic graph), our algorithm decides in time O(2o(k) n log n) if there is a feedback arc set of smaller weight and that differs from F in at most k arcs. To our knowledge this is the first algorithm searching the k-exchange neighborhood of an NP-complete problem that runs in (parameterized) subexponential time. Using this local search algorithm for Weighted Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments, we obtain subexponential time algorithms for a local search variant of Kemeny Ranking — a problem in social choice theory and of One-Sided Cross Minimization — a problem in graph drawing.",29,"{'Parameterized Complexity': 1, 'Graph Algorithms': 2, 'Algorithms': 1, 'Computational Complexity': 1, 'Graph Theory': 1, 'Parameteried Complexity': 1}"

The technique of cube learning has been developed to help them prune satisfying assignments. Cubes, however, have not been able to achieve the same degree of effectiveness as clauses. In this paper we demonstrate how a circuit representation for QBF can support the propagation of dual truth values. The dual values support the identical techniques of unit propagation and clause learning, except now it is satisfying assignments rather than falsifying assignments that are pruned. Dual value propagation thus exploits the circuit representation and the duality of QBF formulas so that the same effective SAT techniques can now be used to prune both falsifying and satisfyingly assignments. We show empirically that dual propagation yields significantperformance improvements and advances the state of the art in QBF solving.",42,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'SAT': 2, 'QBF': 1, 'CSPs': 1, 'MaxSat': 1, 'Discrete Optimization': 1}"

We propose two new benchmarks, one where the orientation of the rectangles is fixed and one where it is free, that include rectangles of various aspect ratios. The new benchmarks avoid certain properties of easy instances, which we identify as instances where rectangles have dimensions in common or where a few rectangles occupy most of the area. Our benchmarks are much more difficult for the previous state-of-the-art solver, requiring orders of magnitude more time, compared to similar-sized instances from a popular benchmark consisting only of squares. On the new benchmarks, we improve upon the previous strategy used to handle dominance conditions, we define a variable order over non-square rectangles that generalizes previous strategies, and we present a way to adjust the sizes of intervals of values for each rectangle's x-coordinates. Using these techniques together, we can solve the new oriented benchmark about 500 times faster, and the new unoriented benchmark about 40 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art.",7,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Heuristic Search': 1}"

This paper presents a simple but effective parallelization of the df-pn search algorithm for a shared-memory system. In this parallelization, multiple agents autonomously conduct the df-pn with a shared transposition table. For effective cooperation of agents, virtual proof and disproof numbers are introduced for each node, which is an estimation of future proof and disproof numbers by using the number of agents working on the node's descendants as a possible increase.

In this paper, we study the relational consistency property R(*,m)C, which is equivalent to m-wise consistency proposed in relational databases. We also define wR(*,m)C, a weaker variant of this property.

However, df-pn has a notorious problem of infinite loops when applied to domains with repetitions. Df-pn(r) cures it by ignoring proof and disproof numbers that may lead to infinite loops. This paper points out that df-pn(r) has a serious issue of underestimating proof and disproof numbers, while it also suffers from the overestimation problem occurring in directed acyclic graph. It then presents two practical solutions to these problems. While bypassing infinite loops, the threshold controlling algorithm (TCA) solves the underestimation problem by increasing the thresholds of df-pn. The source node detection algorithm (SNDA) detects the cause of overestimation and modifies the computation of proof and disproof numbers. Both TCA and SNDA are implemented on top of df-pn to solve tsume-shogi (checkmating problem in Japanese chess). Results show that df-pn with TCA and SNDA is far superior to df-pn(r).

Optimal path lengths in the abstracted problem are consistent heuristic estimates for the original problem. Pattern databases are the traditional method of creating such heuristics, but they exhaustively compute costs for all abstract states and are thus usually appropriate only when all instances share the same single goal state. Hierarchical heuristic search algorithms address these shortcomings by searching for paths in the abstract space on an as-needed basis. However, existing hierarchical algorithms search less efficiently than pattern database constructors: abstract nodes may be expanded many times during the course of a base-level search. We present a novel hierarchical heuristic search algorithm, called Switchback, that uses an alternating direction of search to avoid abstract node re-expansions. This algorithm is simple to implement and demonstrates superior performance to existing hierarchical heuristic search algorithms on several standard benchmarks.",24,"{'Computer Security': 1, 'Program Analysis': 1, 'Abstract Interpretation': 1, 'Fuzz Testing': 1, 'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Heuristic search': 1, 'Optimization': 1, 'Model checking': 1, 'Planning': 1, 'artificial intelligence': 1, 'heuristic search': 1, 'automated planning': 1, 'optimization': 1}"

Leung","Weighted Constraint Satisfaction is made practical by powerful consistency techniques, such as AC*, FDAC* and EDAC*, which reduce search space effectively and efficiently during search, but they are designed for only binary and ternary constraints. To allow soft global constraints, usually of high arity, to enjoy the same benefits, Lee and Leung give polynomial time algorithms to enforce generalized AC* (GAC*) and FDAC* (FDGAC*) for projection-safe soft non-binary constraints. Generalizing the stronger EDAC* is less straightforward. In this paper, we first reveal the oscillation problem when enforcing EDAC* on constraints sharing more than one variable. To avoid oscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak EDGAC* for non-binary constraints. Weak EDGAC* is stronger than FDGAC* and GAC*, but weaker than VAC and soft k-consistency for k > 2. We also show that weak EDGAC* can be enforced in polynomial time for projection-safe constraints. Extensive experimentation confirms the efficiency of our proposal.",24,"{'artificial intelligence': 1, 'constraint programming': 1}"

In this paper we propose a new encoding from Maxclique into MaxSAT and use MaxSAT technology to improve the upper bound based on the partition P. In this way, the strength of specific algorithms for Maxclique in partitioning a graph and the strength of MaxSAT technology in propositional reasoning are naturally combined to solve Maxclique.

Although PIMC search has been criticized in the past for its theoretical deficiencies, in practice it has often produced strong results in a variety of domains. In this paper, we set out to resolve this discrepancy. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, we use synthetic game trees to identify game properties that result in strong or weak performance for PIMC search as compared to an optimal player. Second, we show how these properties can be detected in real games, and demonstrate that they do indeed appear to be good predictors of the strength of PIMC search.

The shortest paths formed by the edges of 8-neighbor 2D grids can be up to 8% longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment. Theta* typically finds much shorter paths than that by propagating information along graph edges (to achieve short runtimes) without constraining paths to be formed by graph edges (to find short ""any-angle"" paths). We show in this paper that the shortest paths formed by the edges of 26-neighbor 3D grids can be 13% longer than the shortest paths in the continuous environment, which highlights the need for smart path planning algorithms in 3D. Theta* can be applied to 3D grids in a straight-forward manner, but it performs a line-of-sight check for each unexpanded visible neighbor of each expanded vertex and thus it performs many more line-of-sight checks per expanded vertex on a 26-neighbor 3D grid than on an 8-neighbor 2D grid. We therefore introduce Lazy Theta*, a variant of Theta* which uses lazy evaluation to perform only one line-of-sight check per expanded vertex (but with slightly more expanded vertices).

Definitely discriminating tests (DDTs) are those input patterns that are guaranteed to discriminate between different hypotheses of non-deterministic systems. Finding DDTs is important in practice, but can be very expensive. Even more challenging is the problem of finding a DDT that minimizes the cost of the testing process, i.e., an input pattern that can be most cheaply enforced and that is a DDT. This paper addresses both problems. We show how we can transform a given problem into a Boolean structure in decomposable negation normal form (DNNF), and extract from it a Boolean formula whose models correspond to DDTs. This allows us to harness recent advances in both knowledge compilation and satisfiability for efficient and scalable DDT computation in practice. Furthermore, we show how we can generate a DNNF structure compactly encoding all DDTs of the problem and use it to obtain a cost-optimal DDT in time linear in the size of the structure. Experimental results from a real-world application show that our method can compute DDTs in less than 1 second for instances that were previously intractable, and cost-optimal DDTs in less than 20 seconds where previous approaches could not even compute an arbitrary DDT.",4,{'Artificial Intelligence': 1}

Algorithm portfolios exploit this phenomenon by predicting solvers' performance on specific problem instances, then shifting computational resources to the solvers that appear best suited. This paper develops a new approach to the problem of making such performance predictions: natural generative models of solver behavior. Two are proposed, both following from an assumption that problem instances cluster into latent classes: a mixture of multinomial distributions, and a mixture of Dirichlet compound multinomial distributions. The latter model extends the former to capture burstiness, the tendency of solver outcomes to recur. These models are integrated into an algorithm portfolio architecture and used to run standard SAT solvers on competition benchmarks. This approach is found competitive with the most prominent existing portfolio, SATzilla, which relies on domain-specific, hand-selected problem features; the latent class models, in contrast, use minimal domain knowledge. Their success suggests that these models can lead to more powerful and more general algorithm portfolio methods.",53,"{'Machine Learning': 2, 'Natural Language Processing': 1, 'Discrete Optimization': 1, 'Logic': 1, 'Satisfiability': 1, 'Neural Networks': 1, 'Evolutionary Computation': 1, 'Artificial Intelligence': 1, 'Cognitive Science': 1}"

Next, we take the idea of exploiting independent subproblems further by adding improvements that allow the algorithm to recognize many more cases of such independence.

The approach allows us to use a principled decision theoretic framework for expert selection, allowing the user to choose a utility function that best suits their objectives.

Coalition Structure generation (CSG) involves partitioning a set of agents into coalitions so that social surplus (the sum of the rewards of all coalitions) is maximized. A partition is called a Coalition Structure (CS). In traditional works, the value of a coalition is given by a black box function called a characteristic function. In this paper, we propose a novel formalization of CSG, i.e., we assume the value of a characteristic function is given by an optimal solution of a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) among the agents of a coalition. A DCOP is a popular approach for modeling cooperative agents, since it is quite general and can formalize various application problems in MAS. At first glance, one might assume that the computational costs required in this approach would be too expensive, since we need to solve an NP-hard problem just to obtain the value of a single coalition. To optimally solve a CSG, we might need to solve n-th power of 2 DCOP problem instances, where n is the number of agents. However, quite surprisingly, we show that an approximation algorithm, whose computational cost is about the same as solving just one DCOP, can find a CS with quality guarantees. More specifically, we develop an algorithm with parameter k that can find a CS whose social surplus is at least max(k/(w*+1), 2k/n) of the optimal CS, where w* is the tree width of a constraint graph. When k=1, the complexity of this algorithm is about the same as solving just one DCOP. These results illustrate that the locality of interactions among agents, which is explicitly modeled in the DCOP formalization, is quite useful in developing an efficient CSG algorithm with quality guarantees.",82,"{'Multi-agent system': 1, 'game theory': 2, 'market design': 2, 'artificial intelligence': 1, 'combinatorial optimization': 1, 'computation': 1, 'economics': 1, 'optimization': 1, 'Multiagent systems': 1, 'algorithmic game theory': 1, 'auction theory': 1, 'matching': 1, 'Robotics': 1, 'Cryptography': 1, 'Networks': 1, 'Automatic Speech Recognition': 1, 'Human Computer Interraction': 1}"

The consequent of each such rule is a signed clause that is 1) logically implied by the nonclausal premise, and 2) strong enough to be the premise of the consecutive proof steps.

Two influential methods aim to automate this process: automated algorithm configuration and portfolio-based algorithm selection. The former has the advantage of requiring virtually no domain knowledge, but produces only a single solver; the latter exploits per-instance variation, but requires a set of relatively uncorrelated candidate solvers. Here, we introduce Hydra, a novel technique for combining these two methods, thereby realizing the benefits of both. Hydra automatically builds a set of solvers with complementary strengths by iteratively configuring new algorithms. It is primarily intended for use in problem domains for which an adequate set of candidate solvers does not already exist. Nevertheless, we tested Hydra on a widely studied domain, stochastic local search algorithms for SAT, in order to characterize its performance against a well-established and highly competitive baseline.

We observe that in different domains the user feedbacks are often heterogeneous such as ratings vs. clicks. Our solution is to integrate both user and item knowledge in auxiliary data sources through a principled matrix-based transfer learning framework that takes into account the data heterogeneity.

Based on such data, a potentially useful service is to make timely and targeted recommendations for users on places where they might be interested to go and activities that they are likely to conduct. For example, a user arriving in Beijing might wonder where to visit and what she can do around the Forbidden City. A key challenge for such recommendation problems is that the data we have on each individual user might be very limited, while to make useful and accurate recommendations, we need extensive annotated location and activity information from user trace data. In this paper, we present a new approach, known as user-centered collaborative location and activity filtering (UCLAF), to pull many users’ data together and apply collaborative filtering to find like-minded users and like-patterned activities at different locations. We model the userlocation- activity relations with a tensor representation, and propose a regularized tensor and matrix decomposition solution which can better address the sparse data problem in mobile information retrieval.

Also, formalisms proposed so far are essentially propositional, which, at the very least, makes them cumbersome to use in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose to model imperfect information games in a new multi-agent epistemic variant of the situation calculus.

In this paper, we propose a topological relation model in which the topological relation between two convex plane regions can be uniquely represented as a circular string over the alphabet {u; v; x; y}. A linear algorithm is given to compute the topological relation between two convex polygons. The infinite relation calculus could be used in hierarchical spatial reasoning as well as in qualitative shape description.",17,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 1, 'Spatial Reasoning': 1, 'Knowledge Representation': 1}"

In this paper, we present a first step towards a theoretical exploration of program debugging algorithms. The starting point of our work is the recent debugging approach based on predicate switching. The idea is to switch the outcome of an instance of a predicate to bring the program execution to a successful completion and then identify the fault by examining the switched predicate. However, no theoretical analysis of the approach is available. In this paper, we generalize the above idea, and propose the bounded debugging via multiple predicate switching (BMPS) algorithm, which locates faults through switching the outcomes of instances of multiple predicates to get a successful execution where each loop is executed for a bounded number of times. Clearly, BMPS can be implemented by resorting to a SAT solver. We focus attention on RHS faults, that is, faults that occur in the control predicates and right-hand-sides of assignment statements. We prove that for conditional programs, BMPS is quasi-complete for RHS faults in the sense that some part of any true diagnosis will be returned by BMPS; and for iterative programs, when the bound is sufficiently large, BMPS is also quasi-complete for RHS faults. Initial experimentation with debugging small C programs showed that BMPS can quickly and effectively locate the faults.",15,"{'supply chain management': 1, 'information system': 1, 'electronic commerce': 1, 'group decision': 1}"

Jeffrey's rule is commonly used for revising probabilistic epistemic states when new information is probabilistically uncertain. In this paper, we propose a general epistemic revision framework where new evidence is of the form of a partial epistemic state. Our framework extends Jeffrey's rule with uncertain inputs and covers well-known existing frameworks such as ordinal conditional function (OCF) or possibility theory. We then define a set of postulates that such revision operators shall satisfy and establish representation theorems to characterize those postulates. We show that these postulates reveal common characteristics of various existing revision strategies and are satisfied by OCF conditionalization, Jeffrey's rule of conditioning and possibility conditionalization.

As probability theory is widely used to represent uncertainty, an interesting question therefore is whether it is possible to induce a probability distribution when merging belief sets. To this end, we first propose two approaches to inducing a probability distribution on a set of possible worlds, by extending the principle of indifference on possible worlds. We then study how the (in)dependence relations between atoms can influence the probability distribution. We also propose a set of properties to regulate the merging of belief sets when a probability distribution is output. Furthermore, our merging operators satisfy the well known Konieczny and Pino-Perez postulates if we use the set of possible worlds which have the maximal induced probability values.

We show that our lower bound subsumes the influential Sieling and Wegener’s lower bound for OBDDs, which is typically used for identifying variable orderings that will cause a blowup in the OBDD size.

Several attempts have been made to adapt classical model-based belief revision and update techniques to DLs, but they are restricted in several ways. In particular, they do not provide operators or algorithms for general DL KB revision. The key difficulty is that, unlike propositional logic, a DL KB may have infinitely many models with complex (and possibly infinite) structures, making it difficult to define and compute revisions in terms of models.

Rather, we may request a constrained experiment, which is a subset r of the input space for which the experimenter returns x in r and f(x). Importantly, as the constraints become looser, the experimental cost decreases, but the uncertainty about the location x of the next observation increases. Our goal is to manage this trade-off by selecting a sequence of constrained experiments to best optimize f within the budget. We introduce cost-sensitive policies for selecting constrained experiments using both model-free and model-based approaches, inspired by policies for unconstrained settings.

OED is concerned with the design of experiments that minimizes variances of a parameterized model. Typical design criteria include D-, A-, and E-optimality. However, all these criteria are based on an ordinary linear regression model which aims to minimize the empirical error whereas the geometrical structure of the data space is not well respected. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal experimental design approach for active learning, called Laplacian G-Optimal Design (LapGOD), which considers both discriminating and geometrical structures. By using Laplacian Regularized Least Squares which incorporates manifold regularization into linear regression, our proposed algorithm selects those data points that minimizes the maximum variance of the predicted values on the data manifold.

Based on the divide and conquer strategy, TSR divides the procedure of robust recognition into outlier detection stage and recognition stage. In the first stage, a weighted linear regression is used to learn a metric in which noise and outliers in image pixels are detected. In the second stage, based on the learnt metric, the large-scale dataset is firstly filtered into a small set according to the nearest neighbor criterion. Then a sparse representation is computed by the non-negative least squares technique. The sparse solution is unique and can be optimized efficiently. The extensive numerical experiments on several public databases demonstrate that the proposed TSR approach generally obtains better classification accuracy than the state of the art Sparse Representation Classification (SRC). At the same time, by using the TSR, a significant reduction of computational cost is reached by over fifty times in comparison with the SRC, which enables the TSR to be deployed more suitably for large-scale dataset.",67,"{'Computer vision': 1, 'Machine learning': 2, 'Biometric recognition': 1, 'intelligent systems': 1, 'plant growth modeling': 1, 'Computer Vision': 1, 'Pattern Recognition': 1, 'Machine Learning': 1}"

Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) are a prominent statistical relational model that consist of weighted first order clauses. Many of the current state-of-the-art algorithms for learning MLNs have focused on relatively small datasets with few descriptive attributes, where predicates are mostly binary and the main task is usually prediction of links between entities. This paper addresses what is in a sense a complementary problem: learning the structure of an MLN that models the distribution of discrete descriptive attributes on medium to large datasets, given the links between entities in a relational database. Descriptive attributes are usually nonbinary and can be very informative, but they increase the search space of possible candidate clauses. We present an efficient new algorithm for learning a directed relational model (parametrized Bayes net), which produces an MLN structure via a standard moralization procedure for converting directed models to undirected models.

Also, the acquisition of labeled data requires medical diagnosis which is expensive, while the collection of unlabeled data such as basic health information is much cheaper. We propose the CS4VM (Cost-Sensitive Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine) to address this problem. We show that the CS4VM, when given the label means of the unlabeled data, closely approximates the supervised cost-sensitive SVM that has access to the ground-truth labels of all the unlabeled data.

One important property is the preservation of the three angles formed by a triangle consisting of three neighboring points in the high dimensional space. If this property is maintained for those same points in the lower dimensional embedding then the result is a conformal map.

We formalize this idea as a cross-task value of information criteria, in which the reward of a labeling assignment is propagated and measured over all relevant tasks reachable through constraints. A specific example of our framework leads to the cross entropy measure on the predictions of coupled tasks, which generalizes the entropy in the classical single-task uncertain sampling.

Since redundant features can have significant adverse effect on learning performance, it is necessary to address this limitation for spectral feature selection. To this end, we propose a novel spectral feature selection algorithm to handle feature redundancy, adopting an embedded model.

We are interested in the minimax approval voting rule in which the outcome represents a compromise among the voters, in the sense that the maximum distance between the preference of any voter and the outcome is as small as possible. This voting rule has two main drawbacks. First, computing an outcome that minimizes the maximum distance is computationally hard. Furthermore, any algorithm that always returns such an outcome provides incentives to voters to misreport their true preferences. In order to circumvent these drawbacks, we consider approximation algorithms, i.e., algorithms that produce an outcome that approximates the minimax distance for any given instance. Such algorithms can be considered as alternative voting rules. We present a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm that uses a natural linear programming relaxation for the underlying optimization problem and deterministically rounds the fractional solution in order to compute the outcome; this result improves upon the previously best known algorithm that has an approximation ratio of 3.

Procaccia and Rosenschein have introduced the concept of distortion to quantify this gap. In this paper, we present the notion of embeddings into voting rules: functions that receive an agent's utility function and return the agent's vote. We establish that very low distortion can be obtained using randomized embeddings, especially when the number of agents is large compared to the number of alternatives.

We design both deterministic and randomized cake cutting algorithms that are truthful and fair under different assumptions with respect to the valuation functions of the agents.",201,"{'Social computing': 1, 'prediction markets and other information aggregation mechanisms': 1, 'peer production': 1, 'algorithmic game theory': 2, 'auction theory': 1, 'Economics and Computation': 2, 'Multi-Agent Systems': 2, 'Artificial Intelligence': 3, 'Algorithmic Game Theory': 5, 'Computational Social Choice': 4, 'Fair Division': 1, 'Computational Economics': 2, 'Algorithms': 4, 'Game Theory': 2, 'computational social choice': 1, 'multiagent systems': 1, 'matching': 1, 'market design': 1, 'Mechanism Design': 3, 'Combinatorial Optimization': 2, 'learning': 1, 'economics': 1, 'theoretical computer science': 1, 'AI': 1, 'Constraints': 1, 'Satisfiability': 1, 'Optimisation': 1, 'Algorithm Design and Analysis': 1, 'Algorithmic Mechanism Design': 1, 'Multi-agent System': 1, 'Complexity': 1, 'Auction Theory': 1}"

In this paper, we present a formal model of multi-agent systems in which belief-desire-intention agents choose their intentions taking into account the intentions of others.

Results showed that the automatic negotiators outperformed PDAs in the same situations in which they outperformed people, and that on average, they exhibited the same measure of generosity towards their negotiation partners.

In such situations, agents' individual preferences over available alternatives may vary, and they may try to reconcile these differences by voting. Based on the fact that agents may have incentives to vote strategically and misreport their real preferences, a number of recent papers have explored different possibilities for avoiding or eliminating such manipulations. In contrast to most prior work, this paper focuses on convergence of strategic behavior to a decision from which no voter will want to deviate. We consider scenarios where voters cannot coordinate their actions, but are allowed to change their vote after observing the current outcome. We focus on the Plurality voting rule, and study the conditions under which this iterative game is guaranteed to converge to a Nash equilibrium (i.e., to a decision that is stable against further unilateral manipulations).

In each cycle, the malicious agent with cyclical behaviour first regains a high trust value after a number of cooperations and then abuses its gained trust by engaging in a bad transaction. Using a game theoretic formulation, Salehi-Abari and White have proposed the AER model that is resistant to exploitation by cyclical behaviour. Their simulation results imply that FIRE, Regret, and a model due to Yu and Singh, can always be exploited with an appropriate value for the period of cyclical behaviour. Furthermore, their results demonstrate that this is not so for the proposed adaptive scheme. This paper provides a mathematical analysis of the properties of five trust models when faced with cyclical behaviour of malicious agents. Three main results are proven. First, malicious agents can always select a cycle period that allows them to exploit the four models of FIRE, Regret, Probabilistic models, and Yu and Singh indefinitely. Second, malicious agents cannot select a single, finite cycle period that allows them to exploit the AER model forever. Finally, the number of cooperations required to achieve a given trust value increases monotonically with each cycle. In addition to the mathematical analysis, this paper empirically shows how malicious agents can use the theorems proven in this paper to mount efficient attacks on trust models.",20,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Machine Learning': 1, 'Computer Security and Privacy': 1, 'Authentication': 1, 'Social Computing': 1, 'Machine learning': 1}"

This kind of search is applicable to various domains, including auctions, first responders, and sensor networks. Using an innovative transformation of the extents-based sequence to a probability-based one, the optimal sequence is proved to consist of either a single search iteration or an infinite sequence of increasing search extents. This leads to a simplified characterization of the the optimal search sequence from which it can be derived. This method is also highly useful for legacy economic-search applications, where all agents are considered suitable candidates and the goal is to optimize the search process as a whole.

In light of the high computational complexity of the coalition structure generation problem, a natural approach is to relax the optimality requirement and attempt to find an approximate solution that is guaranteed to be close to optimal. Unfortunately, it has been shown that guaranteeing a solution within any factor of the optimal requires Ω(2n) time. Thus, the best that can be hoped for is to find an algorithm that returns solutions that are guaranteed to be as close to the optimal as possible, in as close to O(2n) time as possible. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by presenting an algorithm that achieves better quality guarantees with lower worst case running times than all currently existing algorithms.

This can be explained by spite, where the agent's utility not only increases in the agent's surplus but also decreases as the other bidders' surpluses increase. Spite can stem from long-term benefits from making competitors worse off and from inherent psychological effects. There have been important recent game-theoretic analyses of spiteful bidding assuming all agents are equally spiteful. We present, to our knowledge, the first auction analysis in the more realistic setting where bidders may be spiteful to different extents. We show that the equilibrium bidding function can still be written in the same form — except that the spite factor is replaced by an expressed spite factor. This leads to bidders expressing spites that are higher or lower than their true spite depending on others' spite. Perhaps surprisingly, in the two-bidder case, the mapping from true spite to expressed spite is the same across all common auction mechanisms. Furthermore, even with two bidders, important properties of symmetric-spite settings cease to hold: the allocation can be inefficient and the revenue ranking may reverse between first- and second-price auctions.

These sensors can be deployed in unknown and possibly hostile environments, where uncertainty and dynamism are endemic. Such environments are common in the areas of disaster response and military surveillance. Our coordination approach itself is based on work by Stranders et al. (2009), that uses the max-sum algorithm to coordinate mobile sensors for monitoring spatial phenomena. In particular, we generalise and extend their approach to any domain where measurements can be valued. Also, we introduce a clustering approach that allows sensors to negotiate over paths to the most relevant locations, as opposed to a set of ﬁxed directions, which results in a signiﬁcantly improved performance. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to two challenging and distinct information gathering tasks. In the ﬁrst–pursuit-evasion (PE)–sensors need to capture a target whose movement might be unknown. In the second–patrolling (P)–sensors need to minimise loss from intrusions that occur within their environment. In doing so, we obtain the ﬁrst decentralised coordination algorithms for these domains.

This needs to be done in such a way that, if all that we know is the summary, as well as the votes of voters outside the subelectorate, we can conclude which of the m alternatives wins. This corresponds to the notion of compilation complexity, the minimum number of bits required to summarize the votes for a particular rule, which was introduced by Chevaleyre et al. [IJCAI-09]. We study three different types of compilation complexity. The first, studied by Chevaleyre et al., depends on the size of the subelectorate but not on the size of the complement (the voters outside the subelectorate). The second depends on the size of the complement but not on the size of the subelectorate. The third depends on both. We first investigate the relations among the three types of compilation complexity. Then, we give upper and lower bounds on all three types of compilation complexity for the most prominent voting rules. We show that for l-approval (when l ≤ m/2), Borda, and Bucklin, the bounds for all three types are asymptotically tight, up to a multiplicative constant; for l-approval (when l > m/2), plurality with runoff, all Condorcet consistent rules that are based on unweighted majority graphs (including Copeland and voting trees), and all Condorcet consistent rules that are based on the order of pairwise elections (including ranked pairs and maximin), the bounds for all three types are asymptotically tight up to a multiplicative constant when the sizes of the subelectorate and its complement are both larger than m1+ε for some ε > 0.",23,"{'Artificial intelligence': 1, 'Algorithm design': 1, 'Social choice (voting) theory': 1, 'Game theory': 1, 'Mechanism design': 1, 'computer science': 1, 'economics': 1, 'artificial intelligence': 1, 'game theory': 1, 'social choice and mechanism design': 1}"

We show how to use compilation functions to further reduce the time and space requirements. Our main theoretical results are paradoxes for the backward-induction outcomes of Stackelberg voting games. We show that for any n ≥ 5 and any voting rule that satisfies nonimposition and with a low domination index, there exists a profile consisting of n voters, such that the backward-induction outcome is ranked somewhere in the bottom two positions in almost every voter’s preferences. Moreover, this outcome loses all but one of its pairwise elections.

In recent years, GGP agents that use Monte-Carlo simulations to reason about their actions have become increasingly more popular.

While previous work has focused on finding the closest notes to the singer's tracked pitch, we instead seek to recover the melody the singer intended to sing. Often, the melody a singer intended to sing differs from what they actually sang; our hypothesis is that this occurs in a singer-specific way. For example, a given singer may often be flat in certain parts of her range, or another may have difficulty with certain intervals. We thus pursue methods for singer-specific training which use learning to combine different methods for pitch prediction. In our experiments with human subjects, we show that via a short training procedure we can learn a singer-specific pitch predictor and significantly improve transcription of intended pitch over other methods. For an average user, our method gives a 20 to 30 percent reduction in pitch classification errors with respect to a baseline method which is comparable to commercial voice transcription tools. For some users, we achieve even more dramatic reductions. Our best results come from a combination of singer-specific-learning with non-singer-specific feature selection.

The major advantage of combining the local entropy map is that it can detect the salient regions which are not complex regions.

This model considers both local and global salient information, in contrast to the existing models that consider only one or the other. Furthermore, the ""large scale bias"" and ""central bias"" hypotheses are used in this model to select the fixation locations in the saliency map of different scales.

It has important applications in analyzing data from automated monitoring, surveillance, and intelligence analysis in general. In this paper, we formalize MAPR using a basic model that explicates the cost of abduction in single agent plan recognition by ""flattening"" or decompressing the (usually compact, hierarchical) plan library. We show that single-agent plan recognition with a decompressed library can be solved in time polynomial in the input size, while it is known that with a compressed (by partial ordering constraints) library it is NP-complete. This leads to an important insight: that although the compactness of the plan library plays an important role in the hardness of single-agent plan recognition (as recognized in the existing literature), that is not the case with multiple agents. We show, for the first time, that MAPR is NP-complete even when the (multi-agent) plan library is fully decompressed.

We show that Knuth's ``Algorithm X'' (with the efficient ``dancing links'' representation) is particularly suited for our model, and can be adapted to perform a branch and bound search for the second stage, in this model.

The main idea is to compute a decision-making policy in one environment and use it in a different environment, provided the two are ”close enough”. In this paper, we use bisimulation-style metrics (Ferns et al., 2004) to guide knowledge transfer. We propose algorithms that decide what actions to transfer from the policy computed on a small MDP task to a large task, given the bisimulation distance between states in the two tasks. We demonstrate the inherent ”pessimism” of bisimulation metrics and present variants of this metric aimed to overcome this pessimism, leading to improved action transfer. We also show that using this approach for transferring temporally extended actions (Sutton et al., 1999) is more successful than using it exclusively with primitive actions.

One way of overcoming this is by combining admissible heuristics (e.g. by using their maximum), which requires computing numerous heuristic estimates at each state. However, there is a tradeoff between the time spent on computing these heuristic estimates for each state, and the time saved by reducing the number of expanded states. We present a novel method that reduces the cost of combining admissible heuristics for optimal search, while maintaining its benefits. Based on an idealized search space model, we formulate a decision rule for choosing the best heuristic to compute at each state. We then present an active online learning approach for that decision rule, and employ the learned model to decide which heuristic to compute at each state. We evaluate this technique empirically, and show that it substantially outperforms each of the individual heuristics that were used, as well as their regular maximum.",43,"{'artificial intelligence': 1, 'automated planning': 1, 'planning': 1, 'Cognitive Robotics': 1, 'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Automated Planning': 1, 'Machine Learning': 1}"

Implicit dead ends, states with executable actions but no path to the goal, are particularly challenging; existing MDP solvers spend much time and memory identifying these states. As a first attempt to address this issue, we propose a machine learning algorithm called SIXTHSENSE. SIXTHSENSE helps existing MDP solvers by finding nogoods, conjunctions of literals whose truth in a state implies that the state is a dead end. Importantly, our learned nogoods are sound, and hence the states they identify are true dead ends. SIXTHSENSE is very fast, needs little training data, and takes only a small fraction of total planning time. While IPPC problems may have millions of dead ends, they may typically be represented with only a dozen or two no-goods. Thus, nogood learning efficiently produces a quick and reliable means for dead-end recognition.

Given noisy real-world GPS data, we---in contrast---consider the problem of modeling and recognizing activities that involve multiple related individuals playing a variety of roles. Our test domain is the game of capture the flag---an outdoor game that involves many distinct cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain using Markov logic, a statistical relational language, and learn a theory that jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, such as capturing a player. Our model combines constraints imposed by the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by the rules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound fashion. We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a multi-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the activity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future behaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded it. We compare our unified approach with three alternatives (both probabilistic and nonprobabilistic) where either the denoising of the GPS data and the detection of the high-level activities are strictly separated, or the states of the players are not considered, or both.

It runs a modified BP on a lifted network where nodes have been grouped together if they have — roughly speaking — identical computation trees, the tree-structured “unrolling” of the underlying graph rooted at the nodes. In many situations, this purely syntactic criterion is too pessimistic: message errors decay along paths. Intuitively, for a long chain graph with weak edge potentials, distant nodes will send and receive identical messages yet their computation trees are quite different. To overcome this, we propose iLBP, a novel, easy-to-implement, informed LBP approach that interleaves lifting and modified BP iterations. In turn, we can efficiently monitor the true BP messages sent and received in each iteration and group nodes accordingly. As our experiments show, iLBP can yield significantly faster more lifted network while not degrading performance.

Examples of such problems include utility maximization, MAP inference, online and interactive inference, parameter and structure learning, and dynamic inference. Since small changes to the evidence typically only affect a small region of the network, repeatedly performing inference from scratch can be massively redundant. In this paper, we propose expanding frontier belief propagation (EFBP), an efficient approximate algorithm for probabilistic inference with incremental changes to the evidence (or model). EFBP is an extension of loopy belief propagation (BP) where each run of inference reuses results from the previous ones, instead of starting from scratch with the new evidence; messages are only propagated in regions of the network affected by the changes.

Jennings","We introduce the budget–limited multi–armed bandit (MAB), which captures situations where a learner’s actions are costly and constrained by a fixed budget that is incommensurable with the rewards earned from the bandit machine, and then describe a first algorithm for solving it. Since the learner has a budget, the problem’s duration is finite. Consequently an optimal exploitation policy is not to pull the optimal arm repeatedly, but to pull the combination of arms that maximises the agent’s total reward within the budget. As such, the rewards for all arms must be estimated, because any of them may appear in the optimal combination. This difference from existing MABs means that new approaches to maximising the total reward are required. To this end, we propose an epsilon–first algorithm, in which the first epsilon of the budget is used solely to learn the arms’ rewards (exploration), while the remaining 1 − epsilon is used to maximise the received reward based on those estimates (exploitation). We derive bounds on the algorithm’s loss for generic and uniform exploration methods, and compare its performance with traditional MAB algorithms under various distributions of rewards and costs, showing that it outperforms the others by up to 50%.",136,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 3, 'AI for social good': 1, 'game theory': 2, 'human-agent learning': 1, 'multi-armed bandits': 1, 'Optimization': 1, 'Power Systems': 1, 'Game Theory': 1, 'Machine Learning': 1, 'multiagent systems': 1, 'reinforcement learning': 1, 'distributed optimization': 1}"

Homotopy classes of trajectories, arising due to the presence of obstacles, are defined as sets of trajectories that can be transformed into each other by gradual bending and stretching without colliding with obstacles. The problem of finding least-cost paths restricted to a specific homotopy class or finding least-cost paths that do not belong to certain homotopy classes arises frequently in such applications as predicting paths for dynamic entities and computing heuristics for path planning with dynamic constraints. In the present work, we develop a compact way of representing homotopy classes and propose an efficient method of graph search-based optimal path planning with constraints on homotopy classes.

Okuno","Our goal is to develop an interactive music robot, i.e., a robot that presents a musical expression together with humans. A music interaction requires two important functions: synchronization with the music and musical expression, such as singing and dancing. Many instrument-performing robots are only capable of the latter function, they may have difficulty in playing live with human performers. The synchronization function is critical for the interaction. We classify synchronization and musical expression into two levels: (1) the rhythm level and (2) the melody level. Two issues in achieving two-layer synchronization and musical expression are: (1) simultaneous estimation of the rhythm structure and the current part of the music and (2) derivation of the estimation confidence to switch behavior between the rhythm level and the melody level. This paper presents a score following algorithm, incremental audio to score alignment, that conforms to the two-level synchronization design using a particle filter. Our method estimates the score position for the melody level and the tempo for the rhythm level. The reliability of the score position estimation is extracted from the probability distribution of the score position. Experiments are carried out using polyphonic jazz songs. The results confirm that our method switches levels in accordance with the difficulty of the score estimation. When the tempo of the music is less than 120 (beats per minute; bpm), the estimated score positions are accurate and reported; when the tempo is over 120 (bpm), the system tends to report only the tempo to suppress the error in the reported score position predictions.",15,"{'Machine learning': 1, 'Signal processing': 1, 'Robotics': 2, 'Robot Audition and Scene Analysis': 1, 'Artificial Intelligence': 1, 'Signal and Speech Processing': 1, 'Multimodal Integration': 1, 'Spoken Dialogue Systems': 1, 'Spoken Language Processing': 1, 'User Modeling': 1}"

One way to quantify the uncertainy of a QSAR prediction is to predict the conditional density of the activity given the structure instead of a point estimate. If a conditional density estimate is available, it is easy to derive prediction intervals of activities. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate and compare three methods for conditional density estimation for their suitability in QSAR modeling. In contrast to traditional methods for conditional density estimation, they are based on generic machine learning schemes, more specifically, class probability estimators. Our experiments show that a kernel estimator based on class probability estimates from a random forest classifier is highly competitive with Gaussian process regression, while taking only a fraction of the time for training. Therefore, generic machine-learning based methods for conditional density estimation may be a good and fast option for quantifying uncertainty in QSAR modeling.",7,"{'Machine Learning': 3, 'Data Mining': 3, 'Big Data': 1, 'Text Mining': 1, 'Cheminformatics': 2, 'QSAR': 1, 'Computational Sustainability': 1}"

However, when these sub-problem share some common variables, it is not sufficient to simply solve each sub-problem in isolation. We develop a technology for such problems, and use it to address the challenge of finding the concentrations of the chemicals that appear in a complex mixture, based on its one-dimensional 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum. As each chemical involves clusters of spatially localized peaks, this requires finding the shifts for the clusters and the concentrations of the chemicals, that collectively pro- duce the best match to the observed NMR spectrum. Here, each sub-problem requires finding the chemical concentrations and cluster shifts that can appear within a limited spectrum range; these are coupled as these limited regions can share many chemicals, and so must agree on the concentrations and cluster shifts of the common chemicals. This task motivates CEED: a novel extension to the Cross-Entropy stochastic optimization method constructed to address such partially decomposable problems.

A key challenging issue of visual contextual advertising is that images and advertisements are usually represented in image space and word space respectively, which are quite different with each other inherently. As a result, existing methods for Web page advertising are inapplicable since they represent both Web pages and advertisement in the same word space.

Recently, topic models have been introduced for the simultaneous analysis for topics and the sentiment in a document. These studies, which jointly model topic and sentiment, take the advantage of the relationship between topics and sentiment, and are shown to be superior to traditional sentiment analysis tools. However, most of them make the assumption that, given the parameters, the sentiments of the words in the document are all independent. In our observation, in contrast, sentiments are expressed in a coherent way. The local conjunctive words, such as “and” or “but”, are often indicative of sentiment transitions. In this paper, we propose a major departure from the previous approaches by making two linked contributions. First, we assume that the sentiments are related to the topic in the document, and put forward a joint sentiment and topic model, i.e. Sentiment-LDA. Second, we observe that sentiments are dependent on local context. Thus, we further extend the Sentiment-LDA model to Dependency-Sentiment-LDA model by relaxing the sentiment independent assumption in Sentiment-LDA. The sentiments of words are viewed as a Markov chain in Dependency-Sentiment-LDA. Through experiments, we show that exploiting the sentiment dependency is clearly advantageous, and that the Dependency-Sentiment-LDA is an effective approach for sentiment analysis.",256,"{'Natural Language Processing': 1, 'text mining': 1, 'natural language processing': 1, 'opinion mining': 1}"

The trust value of a service is usually in the range of [0,1] and is evaluated from the ratings given by service clients, which represent the subjective belief of these service clients on the satisfaction of delivered services. So a trust value can be taken as the subjective probability, with which one party believes that another party can perform an action in a certain situation. Hence, subjective probability theory should be adopted in trust evaluation. In addition, in SOC environments, a service usually invokes other services offered by different service providers forming a composite service. Thus, the global trust of a composite service should be evaluated based on complex invocation structures. In this paper, firstly, based on Bayesian inference, we propose a novel method to evaluate the subjective trustworthiness of a service component from a series of ratings given by service clients. Secondly, we interpret the trust dependency caused by service invocations as conditional probability, which is evaluated based on the subjective trust values of service components. Furthermore, we propose a joint subjective probability method to evaluate the subjective global trust of a composite service on the basis of trust dependency. Finally, we introduce the results of our conducted experiments to illustrate the properties of our proposed subjective global trust inference method.",57,"{'systems biology': 1, 'trust management': 1, 'recommender systems': 1, 'social computing': 1, 'service computing': 1, 'cyber security': 1}"

Advanced semantic web ontologies, especially in medicine and science, are developing. As more complex ontologies are developed, there is a growing need for efficient queries that handle inference. In areas such as research, it is vital to be able to perform queries that retrieve not just facts but also inferred knowledge and uncertain information. OWL (Web Ontology Language) defines rules that govern provable inference in semantic web datasets. In this paper, we detail a database schema using bit vectors that is designed specifically for RDF datasets. We introduce a framework for materializing and storing inferred triples. Our bit vector schema enables storage of inferred knowledge without a query performance penalty. Inference queries are simplified and performance is improved. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our inference solution is more scalable and efficient than the current state-of-the-art. There are also standards being developed for representing probabilistic reasoning within OWL ontologies. We specify a framework for materializing uncertain information and probabilities using these ontologies.

Since users communicate with each other primarily by posting comments one after another, the message threads are key to analyzing latent social relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract the social relations hidden behind message threads. To evaluate our algorithms, we developed an evaluation system and measured the performances.

Constraint programming has a major ""declarative"" aspect, in that a problem model can be handed off for solution to a variety of standard solving methods.

Specifically, the system must be able to reason about the physical actions and verbal interactions of the characters as well as their perceptions of the world. Furthermore it must make the characters act believably--i.e. in a goal-directed yet emotionally plausible fashion. Finally, it must cope with (and embrace!) the dynamics of a multiagent environment where beliefs, sentiments, and goals may change during the course of a story and where plans are thwarted, adapted and dropped all the time.  In this paper, we describe a representational and algorithmic framework for modelling such dynamic story worlds, Continual Multiagent Planning. It combines continual planning (i.e. an integrated approach to planning and execution) with a rich description language for modelling epistemic and affective states, desires and intentions, sensing and communication. Analysing story examples generated by our implemented system we show the benefits of such an integrated approach for dynamic plot generation.",35,{}

Cassimatis","Many problems in AI, including planning, logical reasoning and probabilistic inference, have been shown to reduce to (weighted) constraint satisfaction. While there are a number of approaches for solving such problems, the recent gains in efficiency of the satisfiability approach have made SAT solvers a popular choice. Modern propositional SAT solvers are efficient for a wide variety of problems. However, particularly in the case of spatial reasoning, conversion to propositional SAT can sometimes result in a large number of variables and/or clauses. Moreover, spatial reasoning problems can often be more efficiently solved if the agent is able to exploit the geometric nature of space to make better choices during search and backtracking. The result of these two drawbacks — larger problem sizes and inefficient search — is that even simple spatial constraint problems are often intractable in the SAT approach. In this paper we propose a spatial reasoning system that provides significant performance improvements in constraint satisfaction problems involving spatial predicates. The key to our approach is to integrate a diagrammatic representation with a DPLL-based backtracking algorithm that is specialized for spatial reasoning. The resulting integrated system can be applied to larger and more complex problems than current approaches and can be adopted to improve performance in a variety of problems ranging from planning to probabilistic inference",8,"{'AI': 1, 'Machine Learning': 1, 'Data Science': 1, 'Cognitive Architectures': 1, 'Spatial/Diagrammatic Reasoning': 1}"

These tasks have many states that can be aggregated together to improve learning efficiency. In an agent, this aggregation can take the form of selecting appropriate perceptual processes to arrive at a qualitative abstraction of the underlying continuous state. However, for arbitrary problems, an agent is unlikely to have the perceptual processes necessary to discriminate all relevant states in terms of such an abstraction.
To help compensate for this, reinforcement learning can be integrated with an imagery system, where simple models of physical processes are applied within a low-level perceptual representation to predict the state resulting from an action. Rather than abstracting the current state, abstraction can be applied to the predicted next state. Formally, it is shown that this integration broadens the class of perceptual abstraction methods that can be used while preserving the underlying problem. Empirically, it is shown that this approach can be used in complex domains, and can be beneficial even when formal requirements are not met.",19,{}

Common analytical approaches to biped walk use simplified models of the physical reality. Such approaches are partially successful as they lead to failures of the robot walk in terms of unavoidable falls. Instead of further refining the analytical models, in this work we investigate the use of human corrective demonstrations, as we realize that a human can visually detect when the robot may be falling. We contribute a two-phase biped walk learning approach, which we experiment on the Aldebaran NAO humanoid robot. In the first phase, the robot walks following an analytical simplified walk algorithm, which is used as a black box, and we identify and save a walk cycle as joint motion commands. We then show how the robot can repeatedly and successfully play back the recorded motion cycle, even if in open-loop. In the second phase, we create a closed-loop walk by modifying the recorded walk cycle to respond to sensory data. The algorithm learns joint movement corrections to the open-loop walk based on the corrective feedback provided by a human, and on the sensory data, while walking autonomously.

In contrast to the policies obtained from MDPs and POMDPs, finite-state controllers have two advantages: they are often extremely compact, and they are general, applying to many problems and not just one. A limitation of finite-state controllers, on the other hand, is that they are written by hand. In this paper, we address this limitation, presenting a method for deriving controllers automatically from models. The models represent a class of contingent problems where actions are deterministic and some fluents are observable. The problem of deriving a controller is converted into a conformant problem that is solved using classical planners, taking advantage of a complete translation into classical planning introduced recently. The controllers derived are ‘general’ in the sense that they do not solve the original problem only, but many variations as well, including changes in the size of the problem or in the uncertainty of the initial situation and action effects. Several experiments illustrating the automatic derivation of controllers are presented.",25,"{'Artificial Intelligence': 2, 'Automated Planning': 3, 'Factored/Combinatorial domains': 1, 'NLP': 1, 'Sequential Decision Making': 1, 'Neurosymbolic methods': 1, 'Machine Learning': 1, 'Cognitive Science': 1}"

The undecidability of reasoning on ASP with functions, implied that functions were subject to severe restrictions or disallowed at all, drastically limiting ASP applicability. We overcame most of the technical difficulties preventing this introduction, and we singled out a highly expressive class of programs with functions (FG-programs), allowing the (possibly recursive) use of function terms in the full ASP language with disjunction and negation. Reasoning on FG-programs is decidable, and they can express any computable function (causing membership in this class to be semi-decidable). We singled out also FD-programs, a subset of FG-programs which are effectively recognizable, while keeping the computability of reasoning. We implemented all results into the DLV system, thus obtaining an ASP system allowing to encode any computable function in a rich and fully declarative KRR language, ensuring termination on every FG program.

In mechanism design, the goal is to design procedures (mechanisms) for making the decision that work in spite of such strategic behavior, usually by making untruthful behavior suboptimal. In automated mechanism design, the idea is to computationally search through the space of feasible mechanisms, rather than to design them analytically by hand. Unfortunately, the most straightforward approach to automated mechanism design does not scale to large instances, because it requires searching over a very large space of possible functions. In this paper, we describe an approach to automated mechanism design that is computationally feasible. Instead of optimizing over all feasible mechanisms, we carefully choose a parameterized subfamily of mechanisms. Then we optimize over mechanisms within this family, and analyze whether and to what extent the resulting mechanism is suboptimal outside the subfamily.

There is considerable research with numerous approximation and heuristic algorithms. Still, none of those approaches has resolved the quality-efficiency tradeoff in a satisfactory manner. In (Halim, Karras, and Yap 2009), we obtain near linear time algorithms which achieve both the desired scalability and near-optimal quality, thus dominating earlier approaches.

This comparison addresses the following questions: (1) What can semantic search achieve that keyword search can not (in terms of behavior)? (2) Why is it difficult to simulate semantic search, using keyword search on the relational data model? We use the term keyword search, when the search is performed on data stored in the relational data model, as in traditional relational databases, and an example of keyword search in databases is [Hri02]. We use the term semantic search, when the search is performed on data stored in the RDF data model. Note that when the data is modeled in RDF, it inherently contains explicit typed relations or semantics, and hence the use of the term “semantic search.” Let us begin with an example, to illustrate the differences between semantic search and keyword search.",4,{}

These fields propose a variety of candidate optimality criteria as possible formulations of the principles underlying natural motion. Recent developments in computational biomechanics allow us to create articulated models of living creatures with a significant degree of biological realism. I aim to bring these elements together in my research by using Reinforcement Learning to generate optimized behavior in biomechanical simulations.

In data consisting of people (or other entities) and their afﬁliations or discrete attributes, we identify unusually similar pairs of people, and we pose the question: Can their similarity be explained by chance, or it is due to a direct (“copying”) relationship between the people? The thesis will explore how to assess this question, and in particular how one’s judgments and conﬁdence depend not only on the two people in question but also on properties of the entire data set. I will provide a framework for solving this problem and experiment with it across multiple synthetic and real-world data sets. My approach requires a model of the copying relationship, a model of independent people, and a method for distinguishing between them. I will focus on two aspects of the problem: (1) choosing background models to ﬁt arbitrary, correlated afﬁliation data, and (2) understanding how the ability to detect copies is affected by factors like data sparsity and the numbers of people and afﬁliations, independent of the ﬁt of the models.",0,"{'Data science': 2, 'Machine learning': 2, 'Computational social science': 2, 'Network science': 2, 'Anomaly and fraud detection': 2}"

The primary focus is on a problem called continual on-line planning. New goals arrive stochastically during execution, the agent issues actions for execution one at a time, and the environment is otherwise deterministic. My dissertation will address this setting in three stages: optimizing total goal achievement time, handling on-line goal arrival during planning or execution, and adapting to changes in state also during planning or execution. My current approach to this problem is based on incremental heuristic search. The two central issues are the decision of which partial plans to elaborate during search and the decision of when to issue an action for execution. I have proposed an extension of Russell and Wefald's decision-theoretic A* algorithm that is not limited by assumptions of an admissible heuristic like DTA*.

Utilizing biologically-inspired mechanisms, I increase multi-agent system robustness for faulty agents when it is unknown exactly which agent is malfunctioning. It is important to determine new ways to increase robustness of a system, as otherwise it cannot be guaranteed to function in all situations and thus cannot be relied upon. Robustness of a system allows agents to recover from errors and thus function continuously, an increasingly important trait as agent systems are deployed in real world scenarios such as sensor networks or surveillance systems where faulty or malicious nodes could disrupt application performance. To achieve robustness, there must either be prevention of all errors, or a technique for recovering from errors after they have occurred.

How to design and analyze desirable voting rules has been studied by economists for centuries. In recent decades, technological advances, especially those in internet economy, have introduced many new applications for voting theory. For example, we can rate movies based on people’s preferences, as done on many movie recommendation sites. However, in such new applications, we always encounter a large number of alternatives or an overwhelming amount of information, which makes computation in voting process a big challenge. Such challenges have led to a burgeoning area—computational social choice, aiming to address problems in computational aspects of preference representation and aggregation in a multi-agent scenario.
