Many practical applications, such as accident prevention and resource pre-allocation, require an extended period for preparation. However, challenges come as long-term prediction is highly error-sensitive, which becomes more critical when predicting urban-wise phenomena with complicated and dynamic spatial-temporal correlation. Specifically, since the amount of valuable correlation is limited, enormous irrelevant features introduce noises that trigger increased prediction errors. Besides, after each time step, the errors can traverse through the correlations and reach the spatial-temporal positions in every future prediction, leading to significant error propagation. To address these issues, we propose a Dynamic Switch-Attention Network (DSAN) with a novel Multi-Space Attention (MSA) mechanism that measures the correlations between inputs and outputs explicitly. To filter out irrelevant noises and alleviate the error propagation, DSAN dynamically extracts valuable information by applying self-attention over the noisy input and bridges each output directly to the purified inputs via implementing a switch-attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments on two spatial-temporal prediction tasks, we demonstrate the superior advantage of DSAN in both short-term and long-term predictions. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/hxstarklin/DSAN."

It is an important research topic which has been widely studied in e-Commerce and relation learning. There are two main limitations in existing attribute value extraction methods: scalability and generalizability. Most existing methods treat each attribute independently and build separate models for each of them, which are not suitable for large scale attribute systems in real-world applications. Moreover, very limited research has focused on generalizing extraction to new attributes."

However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to carefully-crafted perturbations, called adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks can easily fool GNNs in making predictions for downstream tasks. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised increasing concerns for applying GNNs in safety-critical applications. Therefore, developing robust algorithms to defend adversarial attacks is of great significance. A natural idea to defend adversarial attacks is to clean the perturbed graph. It is evident that real-world graphs share some intrinsic properties. For example, many real-world graphs are low-rank and sparse, and the features of two adjacent nodes tend to be similar. In fact, we find that adversarial attacks are likely to violate these graph properties. Therefore, in this paper, we explore these properties to defend adversarial attacks on graphs. In particular, we propose a general framework Pro-GNN, which can jointly learn a structural graph and a robust graph neural network model from the perturbed graph guided by these properties. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with the state-of-the-art defense methods, even when the graph is heavily perturbed. We release the implementation of Pro-GNN to our DeepRobust repository for adversarial attacks and defenses. The specific experimental settings to reproduce our results can be found in https://github.com/ChandlerBang/Pro-GNN."

Extensive studies have shown that modeling such data greatly improves the effectiveness and explainability of the recommendations. However, as ranking is essential in recommendation, there is no principled solution yet for collectively generating multiple item rankings over different aspects."

In particular, search across disciplines or schools of thinking is not supported. This is mainly due to the retrieval with keyword queries: technical terms differ in different sciences or at different times. Relevant articles might better be identified by their mathematical problem descriptions. Just looking at the equations in a paper already gives a hint to whether the paper is relevant. Hence, we propose a new approach for retrieval of mathematical expressions based on machine learning. We design an unsupervised representation learning task that combines embedding learning with self-supervised learning. Using graph convolutional neural networks we embed mathematical expression into low-dimensional vector spaces that allow efficient nearest neighbor queries. To train our models, we collect a huge dataset with over 29 million mathematical expressions from over 900,000 publications published on arXiv.org. The math is converted into an XML format, which we view as graph data. Our empirical evaluations involving a new dataset of manually annotated search queries show the benefits of using embedding models for mathematical retrieval."

In this paper, we investigate a specific security problem called trojan attack, which aims to attack deployed DNN systems relying on the hidden trigger patterns inserted by malicious hackers. We propose a training-free attack approach which is different from previous work, in which trojaned behaviors are injected by retraining model on a poisoned dataset. Specifically, we do not change parameters in the original model but insert a tiny trojan module (TrojanNet) into the target model. The infected model with a malicious trojan can misclassify inputs into a target label when the inputs are stamped with the special trigger. The proposed TrojanNet has several nice properties including (1) it activates by tiny trigger patterns and keeps silent for other signals, (2) it is model-agnostic and could be injected into most DNNs, dramatically expanding its attack scenarios, and (3) the training-free mechanism saves massive training efforts comparing to conventional trojan attack methods. The experimental results show that TrojanNet can inject the trojan into all labels simultaneously (all-label trojan attack) and achieves 100% attack success rate without affecting model accuracy on original tasks. Experimental analysis further demonstrates that state-of-the-art trojan detection algorithms fail to detect TrojanNet attack. The code is available at https://github.com/trx14/TrojanNet."

Use of attention operators on high-order data requires flattening of the spatial or spatial-temporal dimensions into a vector, which is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. This not only incurs excessive requirements on computational resources, but also fails to preserve structures in data. In this work, we propose to avoid flattening by assuming the data follow matrix-variate normal distributions. Based on this new view, we develop Kronecker attention operators (KAOs) that operate on high-order tensor data directly. More importantly, the proposed KAOs lead to dramatic reductions in computational resources. Experimental results show that our methods reduce the amount of required computational resources by a factor of hundreds, with larger factors for higher-dimensional and higher-order data. Results also show that networks with KAOs outperform models without attention, while achieving competitive performance as those with original attention operators."

To mitigate this limitation, therefore, we borrow two notable ideas (i.e., ""explanation by intervention"" from causality and ""explanation are contrastive"" from philosophy) and propose a novel solution, named as GRACE, that better explains neural network models' predictions for tabular datasets. In particular, given a model's prediction as label X, GRACE intervenes and generates a minimally-modified contrastive sample to be classified as Y, with an intuitive textual explanation, answering the question of ""Why X rather than Y?"" We carry out comprehensive experiments using eleven public datasets of different scales and domains (e.g., # of features ranges from 5 to 216) and compare GRACE with competing baselines on different measures: fidelity, conciseness, info-gain, and influence. The user-studies show that our generated explanation is not only more intuitive and easy-to-understand but also facilitates end-users to make as much as 60% more accurate post-explanation decisions than that of Lime."

King, Michael Avidan, Yixin Chen, ","Medical ontologies are widely used to represent and organize medical terminologies. Examples include ICD-9, ICD-10, UMLS etc. The ontologies are often constructed in hierarchical structures, encoding the multi-level subclass relationships among different medical concepts, allowing very fine distinctions between concepts. Medical ontologies provide a great source for incorporating domain knowledge into a healthcare prediction system, which might alleviate the data insufficiency problem and improve predictive performance with rare categories. To incorporate such domain knowledge, Gram, a recent graph attention model, represents a medical concept as a weighted sum of its ancestors' embeddings in the ontology using an attention mechanism. Although showing improved performance, Gram only considers the unordered ancestors of a concept, which does not fully leverage the hierarchy thus having limited expressibility. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Attention Propagation (HAP), a novel medical ontology embedding model that hierarchically propagate attention across the entire ontology structure, where a medical concept adaptively learns its embedding from all other concepts in the hierarchy instead of only its ancestors. We prove that HAP learns more expressive medical concept embeddings -- from any medical concept embedding we are able to fully recover the entire ontology structure. Experimental results on two sequential procedure/diagnosis prediction tasks demonstrate HAP's better embedding quality than Gram and other baselines. Furthermore, we find that it is not always best to use the full ontology. Sometimes using only lower levels of the hierarchy outperforms using all levels."

Most existing local community detection methods are designed for a single network. However, a single network can be noisy and incomplete. Multiple networks are more informative in real-world applications. There are multiple types of nodes and multiple types of node proximities. Complementary information from different networks helps to improve detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel RWM (Random Walk in Multiple networks) model to find relevant local communities in all networks for a given query node set from one network. RWM sends a random walker in each network to obtain the local proximity w.r.t. the query nodes (i.e., node visiting probabilities)."

Seshadhri, ","Triangle counting is a fundamental problem in the analysis of large graphs. There is a rich body of work on this problem, in varying streaming and distributed models, yet all these algorithms require reading the whole input graph. In many scenarios, we do not have access to the whole graph, and can only sample a small portion of the graph (typically through crawling). In such a setting, how can we accurately estimate the triangle count of the graph?"

Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable. In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to adaptively incorporate information from large receptive fields. A set of experiments on citation, co-authorship, and co-purchase datasets have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed methods."

The sparse literature on fair graph mining has almost exclusively focused on group-based fairness notation. However, the notion of individual fairness, which promises the fairness notion at a much finer granularity, has not been well studied. This paper presents the first principled study of Individual Fairness on gRaph Mining (InFoRM). First, we present a generic definition of individual fairness for graph mining which naturally leads to a quantitative measure of the potential bias in graph mining results. Second, we propose three mutually complementary algorithmic frameworks to mitigate the proposed individual bias measure, namely debiasing the input graph, debiasing the mining model and debiasing the mining results. Each algorithmic framework is formulated from the optimization perspective, using effective and efficient solvers, which are applicable to multiple graph mining tasks. Third, accommodating individual fairness is likely to change the original graph mining results without the fairness consideration. We conduct a thorough analysis to develop an upper bound to characterize the cost (i.e., the difference between the graph mining results with and without the fairness consideration). We perform extensive experimental evaluations on real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficacy and generality of the proposed methods."

Motif clustering aims at finding clusters consisting of dense motif patterns. It is commonly used in various application domains, ranging from social networks to collaboration networks, from market-basket analysis to neuroscience applications. More recently, local clustering techniques have been proposed for motif-aware clustering, which focuses on a small neighborhood of the input seed node instead of the entire graph. However, most of these techniques are designed for static graphs and may render sub-optimal results when applied to large time-evolving graphs. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, Local Motif Clustering on Time-Evolving Graphs (L-MEGA), which provides the evolution pattern of the local motif cluster in an effective and efficient way. The core of L-MEGA is approximately tracking the temporal evolution of the local motif cluster via novel techniques such as edge filtering, motif push operation, and incremental sweep cut. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of these techniques on time-evolving graphs. Finally, we evaluate the L-MEGA framework via extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world temporal networks."

Despite the initial success, most, if not all, of the existing works are designed for static networks. Nonetheless, many realistic networks are intrinsically dynamic and presented as a collection of system logs (i.e., timestamped interactions/edges between entities), which pose a new research direction for us: how can we synthesize realistic dynamic networks by directly learning from the system logs? In addition, how can we ensure the generated graphs preserve both the structural and temporal characteristics of the real data?"

State-of-the-art methods for attention-based classification typically require a large training set and operate under the assumption that the label of an image depends solely on a single object (i.e. region of interest) in the image. However, in many real-world applications (e.g. medical imaging), it is very expensive to collect a large training set. Moreover, the label of each image is usually determined jointly by multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Fortunately, for such applications, it is often possible to collect the locations of the ROIs in each training image. In this paper, we study the problem of guided multi-attention classification, the goal of which is to achieve high accuracy under the dual constraints of (1) small sample size, and (2) multiple ROIs for each image. We propose a model, called Guided Attention Recurrent Network (GARN), for multi-attention classification. Different from existing attention-based methods, GARN utilizes guidance information regarding multiple ROIs thus allowing it to work well even when sample size is small. Empirical studies on three different visual tasks show that our guided attention approach can effectively boost model performance for multi-attention image classification."

However, GNNs are mostly treated as black-boxes and lack human intelligible explanations. Thus, they cannot be fully trusted and used in certain application domains if GNN models cannot be explained. In this work, we propose a novel approach, known as XGNN, to interpret GNNs at the model-level. Our approach can provide high-level insights and generic understanding of how GNNs work. In particular, we propose to explain GNNs by training a graph generator so that the generated graph patterns maximize a certain prediction of the model. We formulate the graph generation as a reinforcement learning task, where for each step, the graph generator predicts how to add an edge into the current graph. The graph generator is trained via a policy gradient method based on information from the trained GNNs. In addition, we incorporate several graph rules to encourage the generated graphs to be valid. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed methods help understand and verify the trained GNNs. Furthermore, our experimental results indicate that the generated graphs can provide guidance on how to improve the trained GNNs."

Recently, increasing attention has been paid on graph neural networks (GNNs), which aim to model the local graph structures and capture the hierarchical patterns by aggregating the information from neighbors with stackable network modules. Motivated by the observation that different nodes often require different iterations of aggregation to fully capture the structural information, in this paper, we propose to explicitly sample diverse iterations of aggregation for different nodes to boost the performance of GNNs. It is a challenging task to develop an effective aggregation strategy for each node, given complex graphs and sparse features. Moreover, it is not straightforward to derive an efficient algorithm since we need to feed the sampled nodes into different number of network layers. To address the above challenges, we propose Policy-GNN, a meta-policy framework that models the sampling procedure and message passing of GNNs into a combined learning process. Specifically, Policy-GNN uses a meta-policy to adaptively determine the number of aggregations for each node. The meta-policy is trained with deep reinforcement learning~(RL) by exploiting the feedback from the model. We further introduce parameter sharing and a buffer mechanism to boost the training efficiency. Experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets suggest that Policy-GNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, showing the promise in aggregation optimization for GNNs."

Existing methods use social contexts such as users' engagements as complementary information to improve detection performance and derive explanations. However, due to the lack of sufficient professional knowledge, users seldom respond to healthcare information, which makes these methods less applicable. In this work, to address these shortcomings, we propose a novel knowledge guided graph attention network for detecting health misinformation better. Our proposal, named as DETERRENT, leverages on the additional information from medical knowledge graph by propagating information along with the network, incorporates a Medical Knowledge Graph and an Article-Entity Bipartite Graph, and propagates the node embeddings through Knowledge Paths. In addition, an attention mechanism is applied to calculate the importance of entities to each article, and the knowledge guided article embeddings are used for misinformation detection. DETERRENT addresses the limitation on social contexts in the healthcare domain and is capable of providing useful explanations for the results of detection. Empirical validation using two real-world datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of DETERRENT. Comparing with the best results of eight competing methods, in terms of F1 Score, DETERRENT outperforms all methods by at least 4.78% on the diabetes dataset and 12.79% on cancer dataset. We release the source code of DETERRENT at: https://github.com/cuilimeng/DETERRENT."

Node importance estimation is a crucial and challenging task that can benefit a lot of applications including recommendation, search, and query disambiguation. A key challenge towards this goal is how to effectively use input from different sources. On the one hand, a KG is a rich source of information, with multiple types of nodes and edges. On the other hand, there are external input signals, such as the number of votes or pageviews, which can directly tell us about the importance of entities in a KG. While several methods have been developed to tackle this problem, their use of these external signals has been limited as they are not designed to consider multiple signals simultaneously. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end model MultiImport, which infers latent node importance from multiple, potentially overlapping, input signals. MultiImport is a latent variable model that captures the relation between node importance and input signals, and effectively learns from multiple signals with potential conflicts. Also, MultiImport provides an effective estimator based on attentive graph neural networks. We ran experiments on real-world KGs to show that MultiImport handles several challenges involved with inferring node importance from multiple input signals, and consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 23.7% higher NDCG@100 than the state-of-the-art method."

A reliable way to accurately preserve nonlinear structure is to compute geodesic distances between data points. Manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, aim to preserve geodesic distances in a Riemannian manifold. However, as manifold learning algorithms operate on the ambient dimensionality of the data, the essential step of geodesic distance computation is sensitive to high-dimensional noise. Therefore, a direct application of these algorithms to high-dimensional, noisy data often yields unsatisfactory results and does not accurately capture nonlinear structure."

In this problem we try to build an index on a set of n strings S = s1, ..., sn, with the goal of answering the following two types of queries: (1) the threshold query: given a query string t and a threshold K, output all si ∈ S such that the edit distance between si and t is at most K; (2) the top-k query: given a query string t, output the k strings in S that are closest to t in terms of edit distance. Edit similarity search has numerous applications in bioinformatics, databases, data mining, information retrieval, etc., and has been studied extensively in the literature. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for edit similarity search named MinSearch. The algorithm is randomized, and we can show mathematically that it outputs the correct answer with high probability for both types of queries. We have conducted an extensive set of experiments on MinSearch, and compared it with the best existing algorithms for edit similarity search. Our experiments show that MinSearch has a clear advantage (often in orders of magnitudes) against the best previous algorithms in query time, and MinSearch is always one of the best among all competitors in the indexing time and space usage. Finally, MinSearch achieves perfect accuracy for both types of queries on all datasets that we have tested."

Sidiropoulos, ","Mining dense subgraphs is an important primitive across a spectrum of graph-mining tasks. In this work, we formally establish that two recurring characteristics of real-world graphs, namely heavy-tailed degree distributions and large clustering coefficients, imply the existence of substantially large vertex neighborhoods with high edge-density. This observation suggests a very simple approach for extracting large quasi-cliques: simply scan the vertex neighborhoods, compute the clustering coefficient of each vertex, and output the best such subgraph. The implementation of such a method requires counting the triangles in a graph, which is a well-studied problem in graph mining. When empirically tested across a number of real-world graphs, this approach reveals a surprise: vertex neighborhoods include maximal cliques of non-trivial sizes, and the density of the best neighborhood often compares favorably to subgraphs produced by dedicated algorithms for maximizing subgraph density. For graphs with small clustering coefficients, we demonstrate that small vertex neighborhoods can be refined using a local-search method to grow larger cliques and near-cliques. Our results indicate that contrary to worst-case theoretical results, mining cliques and quasi-cliques of non-trivial sizes from real-world graphs is often not a difficult problem, and provides motivation for further work geared towards a better explanation of these empirical successes."

Benson, ","A graph neural network transforms features in each vertex's neighborhood into a vector representation of the vertex. Afterward, each vertex's representation is used independently for predicting its label. This standard pipeline implicitly assumes that vertex labels are conditionally independent given their neighborhood features. However, this is a strong assumption, and we show that it is far from true on many real-world graph datasets. Focusing on regression tasks, we find that this conditional independence assumption severely limits predictive power. This should not be that surprising, given that traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning methods such as label propagation work in the opposite fashion by explicitly modeling the correlation in predicted outcomes."

One important research problem for crowdsourcing systems is truth discovery, which aims to aggregate noisy answers contributed by the workers to obtain the correct answer (truth) of each task. However, since the collected answers are highly prone to the workers' biases, aggregating these biased answers without proper treatment will unavoidably lead to discriminatory truth discovery results for particular race, gender and political groups. To address this challenge, in this paper, first, we define a new fairness notion named θ-disparity for truth discovery. Intuitively, θ-disparity bounds the difference in the probabilities that the truth of both protected and unprotected groups being predicted to be positive. Second, we design three fairness enhancing methods, namely Pre-TD, FairTD, and Post-TD, for truth discovery. Pre-TD is a pre-processing method that removes the bias in workers' answers before truth discovery. FairTD is an in-processing method that incorporates fairness into the truth discovery process. And Post-TD is a post-processing method that applies additional treatment on the discovered truth to make it satisfy θ-disparity. We perform an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world crowdsourcing datasets. Our results demonstrate that among the three fairness enhancing methods, FairTD produces the best accuracy with θ-disparity. In some settings, the accuracy of FairTD is even better than truth discovery without fairness, as it removes some low-quality answers as side effects."

Its basic operations include group, channel-wise convolution and channel shuffling. However, channel shuffling is manually designed on empirical grounds. Mathematically, shuffling is a multiplication by a permutation matrix. In this paper, we propose to automate channel shuffling by learning permutation matrices in network training. We introduce an exact Lipschitz continuous non-convex penalty so that it can be incorporated in the stochastic gradient descent to approximate permutation at high precision. Exact permutations are obtained by simple rounding at the end of training and are used in inference. The resulting network, referred to as AutoShuffleNet, achieved improved classification accuracies on data from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet while preserving the inference costs of ShuffleNet. In addition, we found experimentally that the standard convex relaxation of permutation matrices into stochastic matrices leads to poor performance. We prove theoretically the exactness (error bounds) in recovering permutation matrices when our penalty function is zero (very small). We present examples of permutation optimization through graph matching and two-layer neural network models where the loss functions are calculated in closed analytical form. In the examples, convex relaxation failed to capture permutations whereas our penalty succeeded."

Such graph generative models usually consist of two steps: learning latent representations and generation of molecular graphs. However, to generate novel and chemically-valid molecular graphs from latent representations is very challenging because of the chemical constraints and combinatorial complexity of molecular graphs. In this paper, we propose MoFlow, a flow-based graph generative model to learn invertible mappings between molecular graphs and their latent representations. To generate molecular graphs, our MoFlow first generates bonds (edges) through a Glow based model, then generates atoms (nodes) given bonds by a novel graph conditional flow, and finally assembles them into a chemically valid molecular graph with a posthoc validity correction. Our MoFlow has merits including exact and tractable likelihood training, efficient one-pass embedding and generation, chemical validity guarantees, 100% reconstruction of training data, and good generalization ability. We validate our model by four tasks: molecular graph generation and reconstruction, visualization of the continuous latent space, property optimization, and constrained property optimization. Our MoFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, which implies its potential efficiency and effectiveness to explore large chemical space for drug discovery."

The challenge is greatest for mixed data sets, including real, Boolean, and ordinal data, where standard techniques for imputation fail basic sanity checks: for example, the imputed values may not follow the same distributions as the data. This paper proposes a new semiparametric algorithm to impute missing values, with no tuning parameters. The algorithm models mixed data as a Gaussian copula. This model can fit arbitrary marginals for continuous variables and can handle ordinal variables with many levels, including Boolean variables as a special case. We develop an efficient approximate EM algorithm to estimate copula parameters from incomplete mixed data. The resulting model reveals the statistical associations among variables. Experimental results on several synthetic and real datasets show the superiority of our proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art imputation algorithms for mixed data."

Traditionally, computational methods have been developed to automatically predict protein interface from hand-crafted features. Recent approaches employ deep neural networks and predict the interaction of each amino acid pair independently. However, these methods do not incorporate the important sequential information from amino acid chains and the high-order pairwise interactions. Intuitively, the prediction of an amino acid pair should depend on both their features and the information of other amino acid pairs. In this work, we propose to formulate the protein interface prediction as a 2D dense prediction problem. In addition, we propose a novel deep model to incorporate the sequential information and high-order pairwise interactions to perform interface predictions. We represent proteins as graphs and employ graph neural networks to learn node features. Then we propose the sequential modeling method to incorporate the sequential information and reorder the feature matrix. Next, we incorporate high-order pairwise interactions to generate a 3D tensor containing different pairwise interactions. Finally, we employ convolutional neural networks to perform 2D dense predictions. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method can consistently improve the protein interface prediction performance."

Glass, Jimeng Sun, ","Clinical trials play important roles in drug development but often suffer from expensive, inaccurate and insufficient patient recruitment. The availability of massive electronic health records (EHR) data and trial eligibility criteria (EC) bring a new opportunity to data driven patient recruitment. One key task named patient-trial matching is to find qualified patients for clinical trials given structured EHR and unstructured EC text (both inclusion and exclusion criteria). How to match complex EC text with longitudinal patient EHRs? How to embed many-to-many relationships between patients and trials? How to explicitly handle the difference between inclusion and exclusion criteria? In this paper, we proposed CrOss-Modal PseudO-SiamEse network (COMPOSE) to address these challenges for patient-trial matching. One path of the network encodes EC using convolutional highway network. The other path processes EHR with multi-granularity memory network that encodes structured patient records into multiple levels based on medical ontology. Using the EC embedding as query, COMPOSE performs attentional record alignment and thus enables dynamic patient-trial matching. COMPOSE also introduces a composite loss term to maximize the similarity between patient records and inclusion criteria while minimize the similarity to the exclusion criteria. Experiment results show COMPOSE can reach 98.0% AUC on patient-criteria matching and 83.7% accuracy on patient-trial matching, which leads 24.3% improvement over the best baseline on real-world patient-trial matching tasks."

These datasets are often crowdsourced from individual users and contain private information like gender, age, etc. The emerging privacy concerns from users on data sharing hinder the generation or use of crowdsourcing datasets and lead to hunger of training data for new deep learning applications. One naive solution is to pre-process the raw data to extract features at the user-side, and then only the extracted features will be sent to the data collector. Unfortunately, attackers can still exploit these extracted features to train an adversary classifier to infer private attributes. Some prior arts leveraged game theory to protect private attributes. However, these defenses are designed for known primary learning tasks, the extracted features work poorly for unknown learning tasks. To tackle the case where the learning task may be unknown or changing, we present TIPRDC, a task-independent privacy-respecting data crowdsourcing framework with anonymized intermediate representation. The goal of this framework is to learn a feature extractor that can hide the privacy information from the intermediate representations; while maximally retaining the original information embedded in the raw data for the data collector to accomplish unknown learning tasks. We design a hybrid training method to learn the anonymized intermediate representation: (1) an adversarial training process for hiding private information from features; (2) maximally retain original information using a neural-network-based mutual information estimator. We extensively evaluate TIPRDC and compare it with existing methods using two image datasets and one text dataset. Our results show that TIPRDC substantially outperforms other existing methods. Our work is the first task-independent privacy-respecting data crowdsourcing framework."

This problem is of great importance to urban development and transportation management, yet is very challenging because the plan would change the local travel demands drastically and the new travel demand pattern might be unprecedented in the historical data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Conditional Urban Traffic Generative Adversarial Network (Curb-GAN), which provides traffic estimations in consecutive time slots based on different (unprecedented) travel demands, thus enables urban planners to accurately evaluate urban plans before deploying them. The proposed Curb-GAN adopts and advances the conditional GAN structure through a few novel ideas: (1) dealing with various travel demands as the ""conditions"" and generating corresponding traffic estimations, (2) integrating dynamic convolutional layers to capture the local spatial auto-correlations along the underlying road networks, (3) employing self-attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependencies of the traffic across different time slots. Extensive experiments on two real-world spatio-temporal datasets demonstrate that our Curb-GAN outperforms major baseline methods in estimation accuracy under various conditions and can produce more meaningful estimations."

After exploring many profiling methods, we identify a new imitation based criteria to better evaluate and optimize profiling accuracy. Considering the objective of teaching an autonomous agent to imitate a mobile user to plan next-visit based on the user's profile, the user profile is the most accurate when the agent can perfectly mimic the activity patterns of the user. We propose to formulate the problem into a reinforcement learning task, where an agent is a next-visit planner, an action is a POI that a user will visit next, and the state of environment is a fused representation of a user and spatial entities (e.g., POIs, activity types, functional zones). An event that a user takes an action to visit a POI, will change the environment, resulting into a new state of user profiles and spatial entities, which helps the agent to predict next visit more accurately. After analyzing such interactions among events, users, and spatial entities, we identify (1)semantic connectivity among spatial entities, and, thus, introduce a spatial Knowledge Graph (KG) to characterize the semantics of user visits over connected locations, activities, and zones. Besides, we identify (2) mutual influence between users and the spatial KG, and, thus, develop a mutual-updating strategy between users and the spatial KG, mixed with temporal context, to quantify the state representation that evolves over time. Along these lines, we develop a reinforcement learning framework integrated with spatial KG. The proposed framework can achieve incremental learning in multi-user profiling given a mixed-user event stream. Finally, we apply our approach to human mobility activity prediction and present extensive experiments to demonstrate improved performances."

The realization that these equally reasonable criteria can lead to contradictory results has, nonetheless, generated a lot of debate/controversy, and has motivated the development of mathematical results establishing the impossibility of concomitantly satisfying predictive parity and error rate balance. Here, we investigate these fairness criteria from a causality perspective. By taking into consideration the data generation process giving rise to the observed data, as well as, the data generation process giving rise to the predictions, and assuming faithfulness, we prove that when the base rates differ across the protected groups and there is no perfect separation, then a standard classifier cannot achieve exact predictive parity. (Where, by standard classifier we mean a classifier trained in the usual way, without adopting pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing fairness techniques.) This result holds in general, irrespective of the data generation process giving rise to the observed data. Furthermore, we show that the amount of disparate mistreatment for the positive predictive value metric is proportional to the difference between the base rates. For the error rate balance, as well as, the closely related equalized odds and equality of opportunity criteria, we show that there are, nonetheless, data generation processes that can still satisfy these criteria when the base rates differ by protected group, and we characterize the conditions under which these criteria hold. We illustrate our results using synthetic data, and with the re-analysis of the COMPAS data."

Especially when data come from imbalanced or heavy-tailed label distributions, or minority groups of a sensitive feature. Classical approaches to address these biases are mostly data- or application-dependent, hence are burdensome to tune. Some meta-learning approaches, on the other hand, aim to learn hyperparameters in the learning process using different objective functions on training and validation data. However, these methods suffer from high computational complexity and are not scalable to large datasets. In this paper, we propose a unified data-driven regularization approach to learn a generalizable model from biased data. The proposed framework, named as targeted data-driven regularization (TDR), is model- and dataset-agnostic, and employs a target dataset that resembles the desired nature of test data in order to guide the learning process in a coupled manner. We cast the problem as a bilevel optimization and propose an efficient stochastic gradient descent based method to solve it. The framework can be utilized to alleviate various types of biases in real-world applications. We empirically show, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, the superior performance of TDR for resolving issues stem from these biases."

However, this task is very challenging due to the combinatorial complexities in the structures of high dimensional systems, their elusive continuous-time nonlinear dynamics, and their structural-dynamic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose to combine Ordinary Differential Equation Systems (ODEs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn continuous-time dynamics on complex networks in a data-driven manner. We model differential equation systems by GNNs. Instead of mapping through a discrete number of neural layers in the forward process, we integrate GNN layers over continuous time numerically, leading to capturing continuous-time dynamics on graphs. Our model can be interpreted as a Continuous-time GNN model or a Graph Neural ODEs model. Our model can be utilized for continuous-time network dynamics prediction, structured sequence prediction (a regularly-sampled case), and node semi-supervised classification tasks (a one-snapshot case) in a unified framework. We validate our model by extensive experiments in the above three scenarios. The promising experimental results demonstrate our model's capability of jointly capturing the structure and dynamics of complex systems in a unified framework."

Different from existing work, we target the generic outlier arms or outlier arm groups whose expected rewards can be larger, smaller, or even in between those of normal arms. To this end, we start by providing a comprehensive definition of such generic outlier arms and outlier arm groups. Then we propose a novel pulling algorithm named GOLD to identify such generic outlier arms. It builds a real-time neighborhood graph based on upper confidence bounds and catches the behavior pattern of outliers from normal arms. We also analyze its performance from various aspects. In the experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data sets, the proposed algorithm achieves 98% accuracy while saving 83% exploration cost on average compared with state-of-the-art techniques."

Unfortunately, the evaluations can be manipulated using fake reviews (""spams"") by professional spammers, who have learned increasingly insidious and powerful spamming strategies by adapting to the deployed detectors. Spamming strategies are hard to capture, as they can be varying quickly along time, different across spammers and target products, and more critically, remained unknown in most cases. Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address the challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy. Nash equilibria of the game lead to stable detectors that are agnostic to any mixed detection strategies. However, the game has no closed-form solution and is not differentiable to admit the typical gradient-based algorithms. We turn the game into two dependent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to allow efficient stochastic optimization based on multi-armed bandit and policy gradient. We experiment on three large review datasets using various state-of-the-art spamming and detection strategies and show that the optimization algorithm can reliably find an equilibrial detector that can robustly and effectively prevent spammers with any mixed spamming strategies from attaining their practical goal.

However, not only does a network evolve, but often the way that it evolves, itself evolves. Thus, knowing, in addition to patterns' frequencies, for how long and how regularly they have occurred-i.e., their persistence-can add to our understanding of evolving networks. In this work, we propose the problem of mining activity that persists through time in continually evolving networks-i.e., activity that repeatedly and consistently occurs. We extend the notion of temporal motifs to capture activity among specific nodes, in what we call activity snippets, which are small sequences of edge-updates that reoccur. We propose axioms and properties that a measure of persistence should satisfy, and develop such a persistence measure. We also propose PENminer, an efficient framework for mining activity snippets' Persistence in Evolving Networks, and design both offline and streaming algorithms. We apply PENminer to numerous real, large-scale evolving networks and edge streams, and find activity that is surprisingly regular over a long period of time, but too infrequent to be discovered by aggregate count alone, and bursts of activity exposed by their lack of persistence. Our findings with PENminer include neighborhoods in NYC where taxi traffic persisted through Hurricane Sandy, the opening of new bike-stations, characteristics of social network users, and more. Moreover, we use PENminer towards identifying anomalies in multiple networks, outperforming baselines at identifying subtle anomalies by 9.8-48% in AUC."

To address these challenges, we propose an automated interaction architecture discovering framework for CTR prediction named AutoCTR.

A key theoretical requirement of IPS weighting is that the policy that logged the data has ""full support"", which typically translates into requiring non-zero probability for any action in any context. Unfortunately, many real-world systems produce support deficient data, especially when the action space is large, and we show how existing methods can fail catastrophically. To overcome this gap between theory and applications, we identify three approaches that provide various guarantees for IPS-based learning despite the inherent limitations of support-deficient data: restricting the action space, reward extrapolation, and restricting the policy space. We systematically analyze the statistical and computational properties of these three approaches, and we empirically evaluate their effectiveness. In addition to providing the first systematic analysis of support-deficiency in contextual-bandit learning, we conclude with recommendations that provide practical guidance."

We ask a generic question: Given two different networks, how can we transform one network to another? We propose an end-to-end model that learns a composition of nonlinear operations so that one network can be transformed to another in a hierarchical manner. The proposed model bears three distinctive advantages. First (composite transformation), it goes beyond the linearity/consistency assumptions and performs the cross-network transformation through a composition of nonlinear computations. Second (representation power), it can learn the transformation of both network structures and node attributes at different resolutions while identifying the cross-network node associations. Third (generality), it can be applied to various tasks, including network alignment, recommendation, cross-layer dependency inference.

For the success of knowledge discovery it is essential that the distances between the embedded vertices truly reflect the structure of the graph. Our fundamental idea is to compress the adjacency matrix by predicting the existence of an edge from the Euclidean distance between the corresponding vertices in the embedding, and to use the achieved compression as a quality measure for the embedding. We call this quality measure Predictive Entropy (PE). PE uses a sigmoid function to define the probability which is monotonically decreasing with the Euclidean distance. We use this sigmoid probability to compress the adjacency matrix of the graph by an entropy coding. While PE could be used to assess the result of any graph drawing or representation learning method we particularly use it as objective function in our new method GEMPE (Graph Embedding by Minimizing the Predictive Entropy). We demonstrate in our experiments that GEMPE clearly outperforms comparison methods with respect to quality of the visual result, clustering and node-labeling accuracy on the discovered coordinates."

In a typical FL process, a central server tasks end-users to train a shared recommendation model using their local data. The local models are trained over several rounds on the users' devices and the server combines them into a global model, which is sent to the devices for the purpose of providing recommendations. Standard FL approaches use randomly selected users for training at each round, and simply average their local models to compute the global model. The resulting federated recommendation models require significant client effort to train and many communication rounds before they converge to a satisfactory accuracy. Users are left with poor quality recommendations until the late stages of training. We present a novel technique, FedFast, to accelerate distributed learning which achieves good accuracy for all users very early in the training process. We achieve this by sampling from a diverse set of participating clients in each training round and applying an active aggregation method that propagates the updated model to the other clients. Consequently, with FedFast the users benefit from far lower communication costs and more accurate models that can be consumed anytime during the training process even at the very early stages. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a variety of benchmark datasets and in comparison to state-of-the-art recommendation techniques."

An appealing way to optimally trade these off is by imposing constraints on the ranking according to which items are presented to a user. This results in a constrained ranking optimization problem that can be solved as a linear program (LP). However, off-the-shelf LP solvers are unable to meet the severe latency constraints in systems that serve live traffic. To address this challenge, we exploit the structure of the dual optimization problem to develop a fast solver. We analyze theoretical properties of our solver and show experimentally that it is able to solve constrained ranking problems on synthetic and real-world recommendation datasets an order of magnitude faster than off-the-shelf solvers, thereby enabling their deployment under severe latency constraints."

Such multimodal data can provide complementary information that can reveal fundamental characteristics of real-world subjects. Thus, multimodal machine learning has become an active research area. Extensive works have been developed to exploit multimodal interactions and integrate multi-source information. However, multimodal data in the real world usually comes with missing modalities due to various reasons, such as sensor damage, data corruption, and human mistakes in recording. Effectively integrating and analyzing multimodal data with incompleteness remains a challenging problem. We propose a Heterogeneous Graph-based Multimodal Fusion (HGMF) approach to enable multimodal fusion of incomplete data within a heterogeneous graph structure. The proposed approach develops a unique strategy for learning on incomplete multimodal data without data deletion or data imputation. More specifically, we construct a heterogeneous hypernode graph to model the multimodal data having different combinations of missing modalities, and then we formulate a graph neural network based transductive learning framework to project the heterogeneous incomplete data onto a unified embedding space, and multi-modalities are fused along the way. The learning framework captures modality interactions from available data, and leverages the relationships between different incompleteness patterns. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing graph-based as well as non-graph based baselines on three different datasets."

This problem is important in many real-world applications such as driver verification in ride-sharing services, risk analysis for auto insurance companies, and criminal identification. Prior work on identifying human mobility behaviors requires additional data from other sources besides the trajectories, e.g., sensor readings in the vehicle for driving behavior identification. However, these data might not be universally available and is costly to obtain. To deal with this challenge, in this work, we make the first attempt to match identities of human agents only from the observed location trajectory data by proposing a novel and efficient framework named Spatio-temporal Siamese Networks (ST-SiameseNet). For each human agent, we extract a set of profile and online features from his/her trajectories. We train ST-SiameseNet to predict the mobility signature similarity between each pair of agents, where each agent is represented by his/her trajectories and the extracted features. Experimental results on a real-world taxi trajectory dataset show that our proposed ST-SiamesNet can achieve an $F_1$ score of $0.8508$, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques."

In machine learning and data mining, these interactions are usually formulated as dependency and correlation among system variables. Similar to Convolution Neural Network dealing with spatially correlated features and Recurrent Neural Network with temporally correlated features, in this paper we present a novel deep learning model to tackle functionally interactive features by stacking a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine and a Deep Neural Network (CRBM-DNN). Variables with their dependency relationships are organized into a bipartite graph, which is further converted into a Restricted Boltzmann Machine conditioned by domain knowledge. We integrate this CRBM and a DNN into one deep learning model constrained by one overall cost function. CRBM-DNN can solve both supervised and unsupervised learning problems. Compared to a regular neural network of the same size, CRBM-DNN has fewer parameters so they require fewer training samples. We perform extensive comparative studies with a large number of supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods using several challenging real-world datasets, and achieve significant superior performance."

Recent research such as generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) demonstrates successes in learning human decision-making strategies from their behavior data using deep neural networks (DNNs), which can accurately mimic how humans behave in various scenarios, e.g., playing video games, etc. However, such DNN-based models are ""black box"" models in nature, making it hard to explain what knowledge the models have learned from human, and how the models make such decisions, which was not addressed in the literature of imitation learning. This paper addresses this research gap by proposing xGAIL, the first explainable generative adversarial imitation learning framework. The proposed xGAIL framework consists of two novel components, including Spatial Activation Maximization (SpatialAM) and Spatial Randomized Input Sampling Explanation (SpatialRISE), to extract both global and local knowledge from a well-trained GAIL model that explains how a human agent makes decisions. Especially, we take taxi drivers' passenger-seeking strategy as an example to validate the effectiveness of the proposed xGAIL framework. Our analysis on a large-scale real-world taxi trajectory data shows promising results from two aspects: i) global explainable knowledge of what nearby traffic condition impels a taxi driver to choose a particular direction to find the next passenger, and ii) local explainable knowledge of what key (sometimes hidden) factors a taxi driver considers when making a particular decision."

Generated clusters are often evaluated with general measures, which may not be meaningful or useful for practical applications and domains. Using a distance metric, a clustering algorithm searches through the data space, groups close items into one cluster, and assigns far away samples to different clusters. In many real-world applications, the number of dimensions is high and data space becomes very sparse. Selection of a suitable distance metric is very difficult and becomes even harder when categorical data is involved. Moreover, existing distance metrics are mostly generic, and clusters created based on them will not necessarily make sense to domain-specific applications. One option to address these challenges is to integrate domain-defined rules and guidelines into the clustering process. In this work we propose a GAN-based approach called Catalysis Clustering to incorporate domain knowledge into the clustering process. With GANs we generate catalysts, which are special synthetic points drawn from the original data distribution and verified to improve clustering quality when measured by a domain-specific metric. We then perform clustering analysis using both catalysts and real data. Final clusters are produced after catalyst points are removed. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets clearly show that our approach is effective and can generate clusters that are meaningful and useful for real-world applications."

In such cases, waiting too long to classify can render predictions useless, regardless of their accuracy, while predicting prematurely can result in potentially costly erroneous results. When predicting multiple labels (for example, types of infections), dependencies between labels can be learned and leveraged to improve overall accuracy. Together, reliably predicting the correct label set of a time series while observing as few timesteps as possible is challenging because these goals are contradictory in that fewer timesteps often means worse accuracy. To achieve early yet sufficiently accurate predictions, correlations between labels must be accounted for since direct evidence of some labels may only appear late in the series. We design an effective solution to this open problem, the Recurrent Halting Chain (RHC), that for the first time integrates key innovations in both Early and Multi-label Classification into one multi-objective model. RHC uses a recurrent neural network to jointly model raw time series as well as correlations between labels, resulting in a novel order-free classifier chain that tackles this time-sensitive multi-label learning task. Further, RHC employs a reinforcement learning-based halting network to decide at each timestep which, if any, classes should be predicted, learning to build the label set over time. Using two real-world time-sensitive datasets and popular multi-label metrics, we show that RHC outperforms recent alternatives by predicting more-accurate label sets earlier."

However, known FDD methods are applicable to nominal data, and in practice non-nominal variables are discretized, e.g., in a pre-processing step. This is problematic because, as soon as a mix of discrete and continuous variables is involved, the interaction of discretization with the various dependency measures from the literature is poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether a given discretization method even leads to a consistent dependency estimate. In this paper, we analyze these fundamental questions and derive formal criteria as to when a discretization process applied to a mixed set of random variables leads to consistent estimates of mutual information. With these insights, we derive an estimator framework applicable to any task that involves estimating mutual information from multivariate and mixed-type data. Last, we extend with this framework a previously proposed FDD approach for reliable dependencies. Experimental evaluation shows that the derived reliable estimator is both computationally and statistically efficient, and leads to effective FDD algorithms for mixed-type data."

Characterizing the conditions guaranteeing the solvability of an evasion attack task thus becomes the key to understand the adversarial threat. Our study is inspired by the weak submodularity theory. We characterize the attackability of a targeted classifier on discrete data in evasion attack by bridging the attackability measurement and the regularity of the targeted classifier. Based on our attackability analysis, we propose a computationally efficient orthogonal matching pursuit-guided attack method for evasion attack on discrete data. It provides provably computational efficiency and attack performances. Substantial experimental results on real-world datasets validate the proposed attackability conditions and the effectiveness of the proposed attack method."

In this paper, we aim to predict turbulent flow by learning its highly nonlinear dynamics from spatiotemporal velocity fields of large-scale fluid flow simulations of relevance to turbulence modeling and climate modeling. We adopt a hybrid approach by marrying two well-established turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning. Specifically, we introduce trainable spectral filters in a coupled model of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), followed by a specialized U-net for prediction. Our approach, which we call Turbulent-Flow Net, is grounded in a principled physics model, yet offers the flexibility of learned representations. We compare our model with state-of-the-art baselines and observe significant reductions in error for predictions 60 frames ahead. Most importantly, our method predicts physical fields that obey desirable physical characteristics, such as conservation of mass, whilst faithfully emulating the turbulent kinetic energy field and spectrum, which are critical for accurate prediction of turbulent flows."

We will focus on detailing the interplay between the common measures of mean square error (MSE) and accuracy as it relates to perceived model performance. MSE is a common aggregate measure for the performance of predictive regression models. The advantages are numerous. MSE is agnostic to the choice of model given that the set of possible outcome values are defined on the appropriate metric space. In practice, decisions on how to subsequently use a trained model are based on predictive performance, relative to a baseline where input features are not used - colloquially a ""random model"". However, the relative performance gains of a model in terms of MSE to the baseline does not guarantee commensurate gains when deployed in downstream applications, systems, or processes. This paper demonstrates one derivation of a distribution to qualify MSE performance for multi-class decision making systems desiring a certain level of accuracy. The model error is qualified through comparison to relevant baselines tied to the application suited to evaluating individual outcome performance criteria."

Cheung, ","Binary data with one-class missing values are ubiquitous in real-world applications. They can be represented by irregular tensors with varying sizes in one dimension, where value one means presence of a feature while zero means unknown (i.e., either presence or absence of a feature). Learning accurate low-rank approximations from such binary irregular tensors is a challenging task. However, none of the existing models developed for factorizing irregular tensors take the missing values into account, and they assume Gaussian distributions, resulting in a distribution mismatch when applied to binary data. In this paper, we propose Logistic PARAFAC2 (LogPar) by modeling the binary irregular tensor with Bernoulli distribution parameterized by an underlying real-valued tensor. Then we approximate the underlying tensor with a positive-unlabeled learning loss function to account for the missing values. We also incorporate uniqueness and temporal smoothness regularization to enhance the interpretability. Extensive experiments using large-scale real-world datasets show that LogPar outperforms all baselines in both irregular tensor completion and downstream predictive tasks. For the irregular tensor completion, LogPar achieves up to 26% relative improvement compared to the best baseline. Besides, LogPar obtains relative improvement of 13.2% for heart failure prediction and 14% for mortality prediction on average compared to the state-of-the-art PARAFAC2 models."

However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of AlphaZero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making."

Disentanglement learning for graph generation has substantial new challenges including 1) the lack of graph deconvolution operations to jointly decode node and edge attributes; and 2) the difficulty in enforcing the disentanglement among latent factors that respectively influence: i) only nodes, ii) only edges, and iii) joint patterns between them. To address these challenges, we propose a new disentanglement enhancement framework for deep generative models for attributed graphs. In particular, a novel variational objective is proposed to disentangle the above three types of latent factors, with novel architecture for node and edge deconvolutions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its extensions."

Our algorithms are based on semidefinite programming and the notion of a hyperbolic distance matrix, in many ways parallel to its famous Euclidean counterpart. A central ingredient we put forward is a semidefinite characterization of the hyperbolic Gramian---a matrix of Lorentzian inner products. This characterization allows us to formulate a semidefinite relaxation to efficiently compute hyperbolic embeddings in two stages: first, we complete and denoise the observed hyperbolic distance matrix; second, we propose a spectral factorization method to estimate the embedded points from the hyperbolic distance matrix. We show through numerical experiments how the flexibility to mix metric and non-metric constraints allows us to efficiently compute embeddings from arbitrary data."

Among different attack settings, the most challenging yet the most practical one is the hard-label setting where the attacker only has access to the hard-label output (prediction label) of the target model. Previous attempts are neither effective enough in terms of attack success rate nor efficient enough in terms of query complexity under the widely used $L_\infty$ norm threat model. In this paper, we present the Ray Searching attack (RayS), which greatly improves the hard-label attack effectiveness as well as efficiency. Unlike previous works, we reformulate the continuous problem of finding the closest decision boundary into a discrete problem that does not require any zeroth-order gradient estimation. In the meantime, all unnecessary searches are eliminated via a fast check step. This significantly reduces the number of queries needed for our hard-label attack. Moreover, interestingly, we found that the proposed RayS attack can also be used as a sanity check for possible ""falsely robust"" models. On several recently proposed defenses that claim to achieve the state-of-the-art robust accuracy, our attack method demonstrates that the current white-box/black-box attacks could still give a false sense of security and the robust accuracy drop between the most popular PGD attack and RayS attack could be as large as 28%. We believe that our proposed RayS attack could help identify falsely robust models that beat most white-box/black-box attacks."

Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated using ranking metrics that depend on the positions of relevant items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates sampled metrics in more detail and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact version, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, e.g., recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. Moreover, the smaller the sampling size, the less difference there is between metrics, and for very small sampling size, all metrics collapse to the AUC metric. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction, obtained by minimizing different criteria such as bias or mean squared error. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. To summarize, our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the quality of the estimate."

First, we propose a novel Convolutional deep Domain Adaptation model for Time Series data (CoDATS) that significantly improves accuracy and training time over state-of-the-art DA strategies on real-world sensor data benchmarks. By utilizing data from multiple source domains, we increase the usefulness of CoDATS to further improve accuracy over prior single-source methods, particularly on complex time series datasets that have high variability between domains. Second, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation with Weak Supervision (DA-WS) method by utilizing weak supervision in the form of target-domain label distributions, which may be easier to collect than additional data labels. Third, we perform comprehensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our domain adaptation and weak supervision methods.

Most existing work on paraphrasing use supervised models that are limited to specific domains (e.g., image captions). Such models can neither be straightforwardly transferred to other domains nor generalize well, and creating labeled training data for new domains is expensive and laborious. The need for paraphrasing across different domains and the scarcity of labeled training data in many such domains call for exploring unsupervised paraphrase generation methods. We propose Progressive Unsupervised Paraphrasing (PUP): a novel unsupervised paraphrase generation method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). PUP uses a variational autoencoder (trained using a non-parallel corpus) to generate a seed paraphrase that warm-starts the DRL model. Then, PUP progressively tunes the seed paraphrase guided by our novel reward function which combines semantic adequacy, language fluency, and expression diversity measures to quantify the quality of the generated paraphrases in each iteration without needing parallel sentences. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that PUP outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art paraphrasing techniques in terms of both automatic metrics and user studies on four real datasets. We also show that PUP outperforms domain-adapted supervised algorithms on several datasets.

Edge text content is encoded as low-dimensional mixtures of latent topics, which serve as semantic channels for topic-level information passing on edges. We embed nodes and topics in the same latent space to capture their mutual dependency when decoding the structural and textual information on graph. We evaluated the proposed model on Yelp user-item bipartite graph and StackOverflow user-user interaction graph.

One common approach is to seek the common information that is shared among different modalities for learning, whereas we can also fuse the supplementary information to leverage modality-specific information. Though the supplementary information is often desired, most existing multimodal approaches can only learn from samples with complete modalities, which wastes a considerable amount of data collected. Otherwise, model-based imputation needs to be used to complete the missing values and yet may introduce undesired noise, especially when the sample size is limited. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on knowledge distillation, utilizing the supplementary information from all modalities, and avoiding imputation and noise associated with it. Specifically, we first train models on each modality independently using all the available data. Then the trained models are used as teachers to teach the student model, which is trained with the samples having complete modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive empirical studies on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets."

However, training GNNs requires abundant task-specific labeled data, which is often arduously expensive to obtain. One effective way to reduce the labeling effort is to pre-train an expressive GNN model on unlabelled data with self-supervision and then transfer the learned model to downstream tasks with only a few labels. In this paper, we present the GPT-GNN framework to initialize GNNs by generative pre-training. GPT-GNN introduces a self-supervised attributed graph generation task to pre-train a GNN so that it can capture the structural and semantic properties of the graph. We factorize the likelihood of graph generation into two components: 1) attribute generation and 2) edge generation. By modeling both components, GPT-GNN captures the inherent dependency between node attributes and graph structure during the generative process. Comprehensive experiments on the billion-scale open academic graph and Amazon recommendation data demonstrate that GPT-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models without pre-training by up to 9.1% across various downstream tasks?"

To account for potential hierarchical topic structures, hierarchical topic models generalize flat topic models by incorporating latent topic hierarchies into their generative modeling process. However, due to their purely unsupervised nature, the learned topic hierarchy often deviates from users' particular needs or interests. To guide the hierarchical topic discovery process with minimal user supervision, we propose a new task, Hierarchical Topic Mining, which takes a category tree described by category names only, and aims to mine a set of representative terms for each category from a text corpus to help a user comprehend his/her interested topics. We develop a novel joint tree and text embedding method along with a principled optimization procedure that allows simultaneous modeling of the category tree structure and the corpus generative process in the spherical space for effective category-representative term discovery. Our comprehensive experiments show that our model, named JoSH, mines a high-quality set of hierarchical topics with high efficiency and benefits weakly-supervised hierarchical text classification tasks."

Most existing taxonomy construction methods extract hypernym-hyponym entity pairs to organize a ""universal"" taxonomy. However, these generic taxonomies cannot satisfy user's specific interest in certain areas and relations. Moreover, the nature of instance taxonomy treats each node as a single word, which has low semantic coverage for people to fully understand. In this paper, we propose a method for seed-guided topical taxonomy construction, which takes a corpus and a seed taxonomy described by concept names as input, and constructs a more complete taxonomy based on user's interest, wherein each node is represented by a cluster of coherent terms. Our framework, CoRel, has two modules to fulfill this goal. A relation transferring module learns and transfers the user's interested relation along multiple paths to expand the seed taxonomy structure in width and depth. A concept learning module enriches the semantics of each concept node by jointly embedding the taxonomy and text. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that CoRel generates high-quality topical taxonomies and outperforms all the baselines significantly."

This enables us to ""fully observe"" all potential treatment outcomes, but while present in historical data, these results are infeasible to produce in real-time at the point of the initial treatment decision. Moreover, treatment policies in these settings often need to trade off between multiple competing objectives, such as effectiveness of treatment and harmful side effects. We present, compare, and evaluate three approaches for learning individualized treatment policies in this setting: First, we consider two indirect approaches, which use predictive models of treatment response to construct policies optimal for different trade-offs between objectives. Second, we consider a direct approach that constructs such a set of policies without intermediate models of outcomes. Using a medical dataset of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) patients, we show that all approaches learn policies that achieve strictly better performance on all outcomes than clinicians, while also trading off between different objectives. We demonstrate additional benefits of the direct approach, including flexibly incorporating other goals such as deferral to physicians on simple cases."

Point processes are widely used in modeling such event data with applications such as predictive policing and disaster event forecasting. Although current algorithms can achieve significant event prediction accuracy, the historic data or the self-excitation property can introduce biased prediction. For example, hotspots ranked by event hazard rates can make the visibility of a disadvantaged group (e.g., racial minorities or the communities of lower social economic status) more apparent. Existing methods have explored ways to achieve parity between the groups by penalizing the objective function with several group fairness metrics. However, these metrics fail to measure the fairness on every prefix of the ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel list-wise fairness criterion for point processes, which can efficiently evaluate the ranking fairness in event prediction. We also present a strict definition of the unfairness consistency property of a fairness metric and prove that our list-wise fairness criterion satisfies this property. Experiments on several real-world spatial-temporal sequence datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our list-wise fairness criterion."

Conditional logit models of discrete choice are a natural approach to modeling relational events as ""choices'' in a framework that envelops and extends many long-studied models of network formation. The conditional logit model is simplistic, but it is particularly attractive because it allows for efficient consistent likelihood maximization via negative sampling, something that isn't true for mixed logit and many other richer models. The value of negative sampling is particularly pronounced because choice sets in relational data are often enormous. Given the importance of negative sampling, in this work we introduce a model simplification technique for mixed logit models that we call ""de-mixing'', whereby standard mixture models of network formation---particularly models that mix local and global link formation---are reformulated to operate their modes over disjoint choice sets. This reformulation reduces mixed logit models to conditional logit models, opening the door to negative sampling while also circumventing other standard challenges with maximizing mixture model likelihoods. To further improve scalability, we also study importance sampling for more efficiently selecting negative samples, finding that it can greatly speed up inference in both standard and de-mixed models. Together, these steps make it possible to much more realistically model network formation in very large graphs. We illustrate the relative gains of our improvements on synthetic datasets with known ground truth as well as a large-scale dataset of public transactions on the Venmo platform."

It is a widely studied yet still challenging problem. Most of the studies are based on the pruning-verification framework, which first prunes non-promising graphs and then conducts verification on the small candidate set. Existing methods are capable of managing databases with thousands or tens of thousands of graphs, but fail to scale to even larger database, due to their exact pruning strategy. Inspired by the recent success of deep-learning-based semantic hashing in image and document retrieval, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) based semantic hashing, i.e. GHashing, for approximate pruning. We first train a GNN with ground-truth GED results so that it learns to generate embeddings and hash codes that preserve GED between graphs. Then a hash index is built to enable graph lookup in constant time. To answer a query, we use the hash codes and the continuous embeddings as two-level pruning to retrieve the most promising candidates, which are sent to the exact solver for final verification. Due to the approximate pruning strategy leveraged by our graph hashing technique, our approach achieves significantly faster query time compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a high recall. Experiments show that our approach is on average 20x faster than the only baseline that works on million-scale databases, which demonstrates GHashing successfully provides a new direction in addressing graph search problem for large-scale graph databases."

The second challenge is the computational cost of training and evaluating multiple pipelines. In this study we present DeepLine, a reinforcement learning-based approach for automatic pipeline generation. Our proposed approach utilizes an efficient representation of the search space together with a novel method for operating in environments with large and dynamic action spaces. By leveraging past knowledge gained from previously-analyzed datasets, our approach only needs to generate and evaluate few dozens of pipelines to reach comparable or better performance than current state-of-the-art AutoML systems that evaluate hundreds and even thousands of pipelines in their optimization process.

However, computing these information matrices is extremely expensive and this enormous cost is currently limiting its application to important problems regarding generalization, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization of deep neural networks. One of the most challenging use cases of information matrices is their use as a preconditioner for the optimizers, since the information matrices need to be updated every step. In this work, we conduct a step-by-step performance analysis when computing the Fisher information matrix during training of ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and show that the overhead can be reduced to the same amount as the cost of performing a single SGD step. We also show that the resulting Fisher preconditioned optimizer can converge in 1/3 the number of epochs compared to SGD, while achieving the same Top-1 validation accuracy.

We propose a randomized approximation approach that mitigates the prohibitive cost of exact computation of Voronoi diagrams in high dimensions for machine learning applications. In experiments with data in up to 50 dimensions, we show that this allows us to significantly extend the use of Voronoi-based simplicial complexes in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to higher dimensions. We confirm prior TDA results on image patches that previously had to rely on sub-sampled data with increased resolution and demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing a TDA analysis on synthetic data as well as on filters of a ResNet neural network architecture.

The MCERA allows us to compute upper bounds to the maximum deviation of sample means from their expectations, thus it can be used to find both statistically-significant functions (i.e., patterns) when the available data is seen as a sample from an unknown distribution, and approximations of collections of high-expectation functions (e.g., frequent patterns) when the available data is a small sample from a large dataset. This feature is a strong improvement over previously proposed solutions that could only achieve one of the two. MCRapper uses upper bounds to the discrepancy of the functions to efficiently explore and prune the search space, a technique borrowed from pattern mining itself. To show the practical use of MCRapper, we employ it to develop an algorithm TFP-R for the task of True Frequent Pattern (TFP) mining. TFP-R gives guarantees on the probability of including any false positives (precision) and exhibits higher statistical power (recall) than existing methods offering the same guarantees.

We thus aim to formulate and explore the robust entity alignment problem, which is non-trivial, due to the deficiency of noisy labels. Our proposed method named REA (Robust Entity Alignment) consists of two components: noise detection and noise-aware entity alignment. The noise detection is designed by following the adversarial training principle. The noise-aware entity alignment is devised by leveraging graph neural network based knowledge graph encoder as the core. In order to mutually boost the performance of the two components, we propose a unified reinforced training strategy to combine them.

The current widely successful deep learning models are largely based on convolution and pooling operations on a Euclidean plane with a regular grid (e.g., image and video data) and thus cannot be directly applied to the non-Euclidean surface. Geometric deep learning aims to fill the gap by generalizing deep learning models from a 2D Euclidean plane to a 3D geometric surface. The problem has important applications in human-computer interaction, biochemistry, and mechanical engineering, but is uniquely challenging due to the lack of a regular grid framework and the difficulties in learning geometric features on a non-Euclidean manifold. Existing works focus on generalizing deep learning models from 2D image to graphs (e.g., graph neural networks) or 3D mesh surfaces but without fully learning geometric features from a differential geometry perspective. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel geometric deep learning model called CurvaNet that integrates differential geometry with graph neural networks. The key idea is to learn direction sensitive 3D shape features through directional curvature filters. We design a U-Net like architecture with downsampling and upsampling paths based on mesh pooling and unpooling operations.

While taxonomy construction from scratch is considerably studied in the literature, how to effectively enrich existing incomplete taxonomies remains an open yet important research question. Taxonomy enrichment not only requires the robustness to deal with emerging terms but also the consistency between existing taxonomy structure and new term attachment. In this paper, we present a self-supervised end-to-end framework, Octet, for Online Catalog Taxonomy EnrichmenT. Octet leverages heterogeneous information unique to online catalog taxonomies such as user queries, items, and their relations to the taxonomy nodes while requiring no other supervision than the existing taxonomies.

Back in the old days when labor-intensive survey-studies were needed to collect public opinions, analyzing ordinary citizens' political tendencies was uneasy. The rise of social medias, such as Twitter, has enabled us to gather ordinary citizen's data easily.

Recent developments in KT using flexible deep neural network-based models excel at this task. However, these models often offer limited interpretability, thus making them insufficient for personalized learning, which requires using interpretable feedback and actionable recommendations to help learners achieve better learning outcomes. In this paper, we propose attentive knowledge tracing (AKT), which couples flexible attention-based neural network models with a series of novel, interpretable model components inspired by cognitive and psychometric models. AKT uses a novel monotonic attention mechanism that relates a learner's future responses to assessment questions to their past responses; attention weights are computed using exponential decay and a context-aware relative distance measure, in addition to the similarity between questions. Moreover, we use the Rasch model to regularize the concept and question embeddings; these embeddings are able to capture individual differences among questions on the same concept without using an excessive number of parameters. We conduct experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets and show that AKT outperforms existing KT methods (by up to $6%$ in AUC in some cases) on predicting future learner responses.

However, only about one quarter of these studies investigate the underlying neurophysiological implications. This work proposes and validates a method to investigate frequency bands important to EEG-driven deep learning models. Easy perturbation EEG algorithm for spectral importance (easyPEASI) is simpler than previous methods and requires only perturbations to input data. We validate easyPEASI on EEG pathology classification using the Temple University Health EEG Corpus. easyPEASI is further applied to characterize the effects of patients' medications on brain rhythms. We investigate classifications of patients taking one of two anticonvulsant medications, Dilantin (phenytoin) and Keppra (levetiracetam), and subjects taking no medications. We find that for recordings of subjects with clinically-determined normal EEG that these medications effect the Theta and Alpha band most significantly. For recordings with clinically-determined abnormal EEG these medications affected the Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands most significantly.

Trained in a semi-supervised end-to-end fashion, GCNs can learn to integrate node features and graph structures to generate high-quality embeddings that can be used for various downstream tasks like search and recommendation. However, existing GCNs mostly work on homogeneous graphs and consider a single embedding for each node, which do not sufficiently model the multi-facet nature and complex interaction of nodes in real-world networks. Here, we present a contextualized GCN engine by modeling the multipartite networks of target nodes and their intermediatecontext nodes that specify the contexts of their interactions. Towards the neighborhood aggregation process, we devise a contextual masking operation at the feature level and a contextual attention mechanism at the node level to achieve interaction contextualization by treating neighboring target nodes based on intermediate context nodes. Consequently, we compute multiple embeddings for target nodes that capture their diverse facets and different interactions during graph convolution, which is useful for fine-grained downstream applications. To enable efficient web-scale training, we build a parallel random walk engine to pre-sample contextualized neighbors, and a Hadoop2-based data provider pipeline to pre-join training data, dynamically reduce multi-GPU training time, and avoid high memory cost. Extensive experiments on the bipartite Pinterest graph and tripartite OAG graph corroborate the advantage of the proposed system."

One domain where this task is crucial is in bioinformatics, where the energy landscape that organizes three-dimensional structures of a molecule by their energetics is a powerful construct. The landscape can be leveraged, among other things, to reveal macrostates where a molecule is biologically-active. This is a daunting task, as landscapes of complex actuated systems, such as molecules, are inherently high-dimensional. Nonetheless, our laboratories have made some progress via topological and statistical analysis of spatial data over the recent years. We have proposed what is essentially a dichotomy, methods that are more pertinent for visualization-driven discovery, and methods that are more pertinent for discovery of the biologically-active macrostates but not amenable to visualization. In this paper, we present a novel, hybrid method that combines strengths of these methods, allowing both visualization of the landscape and discovery of macrostates. We demonstrate what the method is capable of uncovering in comparison with existing methods over structure spaces sampled with conformational sampling algorithms. Though the direct evaluation in this paper is on protein energy landscapes, the proposed method is of broad interest in cross-cutting problems that necessitate characterization of fitness and optimization landscapes."

In the catalog, a product is associated with multiple attributes whose values are short texts, such as product name, brand, functionality and flavor. Usually individual retailers self-report these key values, and thus the catalog information unavoidably contains noisy facts. It is very important to validate the correctness of these values in order to improve shopper experiences and enable more effective product recommendation. Due to the huge volume of products, an effective automatic validation approach is needed. In this paper, we propose to develop an automatic validation approach that verifies the correctness of textual attribute values for products. This can be formulated as a task as cross-checking a textual attribute value against product profile, which is a short textual description of the product on eCommerce website. Although existing deep neural network models have shown success in conducting cross-checking between two pieces of texts, their success has to be dependent upon a large set of quality labeled data, which are hard to obtain in this validation task: products span a variety of categories. Due to the category difference, annotation has to be done on all the categories, which is impossible to achieve in real practice."

In this paper, we discuss the techniques for applying EBR to a Facebook Search system. We introduce the unified embedding framework developed to model semantic embeddings for personalized search, and the system to serve embedding-based retrieval in a typical search system based on an inverted index. We discuss various tricks and experiences on end-to-end optimization of the whole system, including ANN parameter tuning and full-stack optimization. Finally, we present our progress on two selected advanced topics about modeling. We evaluated EBR on verticals for Facebook Search with significant metrics gains observed in online A/B experiments.

Existing methods represent behavior log as a sequence of adopted items and find sequential patterns; however, concrete location and time information in the behavior log, reflecting dynamic and periodic patterns, joint with the spatial dimension, can be useful for modeling users and predicting their characteristics. In this work, we propose a novel model based on graph neural networks for learning user representations from spatiotemporal behavior data. Our model's architecture incorporates two networked structures. One is a tripartite network of items, sessions, and locations. The other is a hierarchical calendar network of hour, week, and weekday nodes. It first aggregates embeddings of location and items into session embeddings via the tripartite network, and then generates user embeddings from the session embeddings via the calendar structure. The user embeddings preserve spatial patterns and temporal patterns of a variety of periodicity (e.g., hourly, weekly, and weekday patterns). It adopts the attention mechanism to model complex interactions among the multiple patterns in user behaviors. Experiments on real datasets (i.e., clicks on news articles in a mobile app) show our approach outperforms strong baselines for predicting missing demographic attributes."

Offline-developed algorithms are guided by offline evaluation metrics, which are often different from online business key performance indicators (KPIs). To maximize business KPIs, it is important to pick a north star among all available offline evaluation metrics. By noting that online products can be measured by online evaluation metrics, the online counterparts of offline evaluation metrics, we decompose the problem into two parts. As the offline A/B test literature works out the first part: counterfactual estimators of offline evaluation metrics that move the same way as their online counterparts, we focus on the second part: causal effects of online evaluation metrics on business KPIs. The north star of offline evaluation metrics should be the one whose online counterpart causes the most significant lift in the business KPI. We model the online evaluation metric as a mediator and formalize its causality with the business KPI as dose-response function (DRF). Our novel approach, causal meta-mediation analysis, leverages summary statistics of many existing randomized experiments to identify, estimate, and test the mediator DRF. It is easy to implement and to scale up, and has many advantages over the literature of mediation analysis and meta-analysis. We demonstrate its effectiveness by simulation and implementation on real data."

In our system, as well as most e-commerce scenarios, ads are displayed with images. This makes visual-aware Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction of crucial importance to both business effectiveness and user experience. Existing algorithms usually extract visual features using off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and late fuse the visual and non-visual features for the finally predicted CTR. Despite being extensively studied, this field still face two key challenges. First, although encouraging progress has been made in offline studies, applying CNNs in real systems remains non-trivial, due to the strict requirements for efficient end-to-end training and low-latency online serving. Second, the off-the-shelf CNNs and late fusion architectures are suboptimal. Specifically, off-the-shelf CNNs were designed for classification thus never take categories as input features. While in e-commerce, categories are precisely labeled and contain abundant visual priors that will help the visual modeling. Unaware of the ad category, these CNNs may extract some unnecessary category-unrelated features, wasting CNN's limited expression ability. To overcome the two challenges, we propose Category-specific CNN (CSCNN) specially for CTR prediction. CSCNN early incorporates the category knowledge with a light-weighted attention-module on each convolutional layer. This enables CSCNN to extract expressive category-specific visual patterns that benefit the CTR prediction. Offline experiments on benchmark and a 10 billion scale real production dataset from JD, together with an Online A/B test show that CSCNN outperforms all compared state-of-the-art algorithms. We also build a highly efficient infrastructure to accomplish end-to-end training with CNN on the 10 billion scale real production dataset within 24 hours, and meet the low latency requirements of online system (20ms on CPU). CSCNN is now deployed in the search advertising system of JD, serving the main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users."

In the urban computing field, place embeddings generated using human mobility patterns via recurrent neural networks are used to understand the functionality of urban areas. Translating place embeddings across cities allow us to transfer knowledge across cities, which may be used for various downstream tasks such as planning new store locations. Despite such advances, current methods fail to translate place embeddings across domains with different scales (e.g. Tokyo to Niigata), due to the straightforward adoption of neural machine translation (NMT) methods from NLP, where vocabulary sizes are similar across languages. We refer to this issue as the domain imbalance problem in unsupervised translation tasks. We address this problem by proposing an unsupervised translation method that translates embeddings by exploiting common hierarchical structures that exist across imbalanced domains. The effectiveness of our method is tested using place embeddings generated from mobile phone data in 6 Japanese cities of heterogeneous sizes. Validation using landuse data clarify that using hierarchical anchors improves the translation accuracy across imbalanced domains. Our method is agnostic to input data type, thus could be applied to unsupervised translation tasks in various fields in addition to linguistics and urban computing."

However, the effectiveness of hydropower plants is affected by multiple factors such as reservoir capacity, rainfall, temperature and fluctuating electricity demand, and particularly their complicated relationships, which make the prediction/recommendation of station operational output a difficult challenge. In this paper, we present DeepHydro, a novel stochastic method for modeling multivariate time series (e.g., water inflow/outflow and temperature) and forecasting power generation of hydropower stations. DeepHydro captures temporal dependencies in co-evolving time series with a new conditioned latent recurrent neural networks, which not only considers the hidden states of observations but also preserves the uncertainty of latent variables. We introduce a generative network parameterized on a continuous normalizing flow to approximate the complex posterior distribution of multivariate time series data, and further use neural ordinary differential equations to estimate the continuous-time dynamics of the latent variables constituting the observable data. This allows our model to deal with the discrete observations in the context of continuous dynamic systems, while being robust to the noise. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets from a large power generation company consisting of cascade hydropower stations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively predict the power production and significantly outperform the possible candidate baseline approaches."

To secure government revenue without interrupting legitimate trade flows, customs administrations around the world strive to develop ways to detect illicit trades. This paper proposes DATE, a model of Dual-task Attentive Tree-aware Embedding, to classify and rank illegal trade flows that contribute the most to the overall customs revenue when caught. The strength of DATE comes from combining a tree-based model for interpretability and transaction-level embeddings with dual attention mechanisms. To accurately identify illicit transactions and predict tax revenue, DATE learns simultaneously from illicitness and surtax of each transaction. With a five-year amount of customs import data with a test illicit ratio of 2.24%, DATE shows a remarkable precision of 92.7% on illegal cases and a recall of 49.3% on revenue after inspecting only 1% of all trade flows. We also discuss issues on deploying DATE in Nigeria Customs Service, in collaboration with the World Customs Organization."

However, many developing countries still lack reliable data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for measuring economic development from high-resolution satellite images in the absence of ground truth statistics. Our method consists of three steps. First, we run a clustering algorithm on satellite images that distinguishes artifacts from nature (siCluster). Second, we generate a partial order graph of the identified clusters based on the level of economic development, either by human guidance or by low-resolution statistics (siPog). Third, we use a CNN-based sorter that assigns differentiable scores to each satellite grid based on the relative ranks of clusters (siScore). The novelty of our method is that we break down a computationally hard problem into sub-tasks, which involves a human-in-the-loop solution. With the combination of unsupervised learning and the partial orders of dozens of urban vs. rural clusters, our method can estimate the economic development scores of over 10,000 satellite grids consistently with other baseline development proxies (Spearman correlation of 0.851).

To assist policymakers in devising effective and accurate long-term strategies to mitigate SUD, it is necessary to critically analyze environmental, psychological, and other factors associated with SUD among homeless youth. Unfortunately, there is no definitive data-driven study on analyzing factors associated with SUD among homeless youth. While there have been a few prior studies in the past, they (i) do not analyze variation in the associated factors for SUD with geographical heterogeneity in their studies; and (ii) only consider a few contributing factors to SUD in relatively small samples. This work aims to fill this gap by making the following three contributions: (i) we use a real-world dataset collected from ~1,400 homeless youth (across six American states) to build accurate Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting the susceptibility of homeless youth to SUD; (ii) we find a representative set of factors associated with SUD among this population by analyzing feature importance values associated with our ML models; and (iii) we investigate the effect of geographical heterogeneity on the factors associated with SUD.

To better understand climate change, scientists developed various Global Climate Models (GCMs) to simulate the global climate and make projections for future climate values. These global climate models have coarse grids (i.e., low resolutions both in space and time) due to limitations of computing power and simulation time. Although they are helpful in predicting large scale long term trend in climate, they are too coarse for impact analysis in smaller scales such as in regional or local scale. However, climate conditions in regional or local scale are very important in making decisions related to climate conditions such as infrastructure, transportation and evacuation, as they highly depend on small scale climate conditions. In this paper, we proposed YNet, a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with skip connections and fusion capabilities to perform downscaling for climate variables, on multiple GCMs directly rather than on reanalysis data. We analyzed and compared our proposed method with four other methods on datasets of three climate variables: mean precipitation, and extreme values (maximum temperature and minimum temperature).

However, these maps typically exist as scanned images without searchable metadata. Existing approaches making historical maps searchable rely on tedious manual work (including crowd-sourcing) to generate the metadata (e.g., geolocations and keywords). Optical character recognition (OCR) software could alleviate the required manual work, but the recognition results are individual words instead of location phrases (e.g., ""Black'' and ""Mountain'' vs. ""Black Mountain''). This paper presents an end-to-end approach to address the real-world problem of finding and indexing historical map images. This approach automatically processes historical map images to extract their text content and generates a set of metadata that is linked to large external geospatial knowledge bases. The linked metadata in the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format support complex queries for finding and indexing historical maps, such as retrieving all historical maps covering mountain peaks higher than 1,000 meters in California. We have implemented the approach in a system called mapKurator. We have evaluated mapKurator using historical maps from several sources with various map styles, scales, and coverage. Our results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. The code has been made publicly available as modules of the Kartta Labs project at https://github.com/kartta-labs/Project."

This makes it a particularly difficult task to automate. Existing styling products generally involve human specialists and a highly curated set of fashion items. In this paper, we will describe how we bootstrapped the Complete The Look (CTL) system at Pinterest. This is a technology that aims to learn the subjective task of ""style compatibility"" in order to recommend complementary items that complete an outfit. In particular, we want to show recommendations from other categories that are compatible with an item of interest. For example, what are some heels that go well with this cocktail dress? We will introduce our outfit dataset of over 1 million outfits and 4 million objects, a subset of which we will make available to the research community, and describe the pipeline used to obtain and refresh this dataset. Furthermore, we will describe how we evaluate this subjective task and compare model performance across multiple training methods. Lastly, we will share our lessons going from experimentation to working prototype, and how to mitigate failure modes in the production environment. Our work represents one of the first examples of an industrial-scale solution for compatibility-based fashion recommendation."

However, most platforms optimize recommending and advertising strategies by different teams separately via different techniques, which may lead to suboptimal overall performances. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel two-level reinforcement learning framework to jointly optimize the recommending and advertising strategies, where the first level generates a list of recommendations to optimize user experience in the long run; then the second level inserts ads into the recommendation list that can balance the immediate advertising revenue from advertisers and the negative influence of ads on long-term user experience. To be specific, the first level tackles high combinatorial action space problem that selects a subset items from the large item space; while the second level determines three internally related tasks, i.e., (i) whether to insert an ad, and if yes, (ii) the optimal ad and (iii) the optimal location to insert. The experimental results based on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We have released the implementation code to ease reproductivity."

Globally, industrial-scale production systems account for most of the poultry meat and eggs produced. The welfare of these birds matters for both ethical and economic reasons. From an ethical perspective, poultry have a sufficient degree of awareness to suffer pain if their health is poor, or deprivation if poorly housed. From an economic viewpoint, consumers increasingly value poultry welfare, so better market access can be obtained by producers who demonstrate concern for their flocks. Recent advances in sensor technology has allowed the opportunity to record behavioral patterns in chickens, and several research groups have shown that such data can be exploited to enhance chicken welfare. However, classifying chicken behaviors poses several unique challenges which are not observed in the UCR archive or other classic benchmark collections. In particular, some behaviors are manifested in the shape of the subsequences, whereas others only in more abstract features. Most algorithms only work well for one such modality. In addition, our data of interest has classes that greatly differ in duration, and are only weakly labeled, again defying the assumptions of the classic benchmark datasets. In this work, we propose a general-purpose framework to robustly learn and classify from datasets exhibiting these issues. While our experience is with fowl, the lessons we have learned may be more generally applicable to real-world datasets in other domains including manufacturing and human health."

Given the size and complexity reached by its IT operations, the number of sensors needed to obtain measurements over time, used to infer normal and abnormal behaviors, has increased dramatically making traditional expert-based supervision methods slow or prone to errors. In this paper, we propose a fast and stable method called UnSupervised Anomaly Detection for multivariate time series (USAD) based on adversely trained autoencoders. Its autoencoder architecture makes it capable of learning in an unsupervised way. The use of adversarial training and its architecture allows it to isolate anomalies while providing fast training. We study the properties of our methods through experiments on five public datasets, thus demonstrating its robustness, training speed and high anomaly detection performance. Through a feasibility study using Orange's proprietary data we have been able to validate Orange's requirements on scalability, stability, robustness, training speed and high performance."

Chief among those measures is the massive lockdown of entire countries and cities, which beyond its global economic impact has created some deep social and psychological tensions within populations. While the adopted mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful, policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health interventions. Such models are unfortunately known to be sensitive to some key parameters, which are usually set based on rules-of-thumb."

Until recently, such signals were usually collected through manual auscultation at scheduled visits. Research has now started to use digital technology to gather bodily sounds (e.g., from digital stethoscopes) for cardiovascular or respiratory examination, which could then be used for automatic analysis. Some initial work shows promise in detecting diagnostic signals of COVID-19 from voice and coughs. In this paper we describe our data analysis over a large-scale crowdsourced dataset of respiratory sounds collected to aid diagnosis of COVID-19. We use coughs and breathing to understand how discernible COVID-19 sounds are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Our results show that even a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify correctly healthy and COVID-19 sounds. We also show how we distinguish a user who tested positive for COVID-19 and has a cough from a healthy user with a cough, and users who tested positive for COVID-19 and have a cough from users with asthma and a cough. Our models achieve an AUC of above 80% across all tasks. These results are preliminary and only scratch the surface of the potential of this type of data and audio-based machine learning. This work opens the door to further investigation of how automatically analysed respiratory patterns could be used as pre-screening signals to aid COVID-19 diagnosis."

Rodolfa, Rayid Ghani, ","Tackling issues of bias and fairness when building and deploying data science systems has received increased attention from the research community in recent years, yet a lot of the research has focused on theoretical aspects and very limited set of application areas and data sets. There is a lack of 1) practical training materials, 2) methodologies, and 3) tools for researchers and developers working on real-world algorithmic decision making system to deal with issues of bias and fairness. Today, treating bias and fairness as primary metrics of interest, and building, selecting, and validating models using those metrics is not standard practice for data scientists. In this hands-on tutorial we will try to bridge the gap between research and practice, by deep diving into algorithmic fairness, from metrics and definitions to practical case studies, including bias audits using the Aequitas toolkit (http://github.com/dssg/aequitas). By the end of this hands-on tutorial, the audience will be familiar with bias mitigation frameworks and tools to help them making decisions during a project based on intervention and deployment contexts in which their system will be used."

However, the existence of adversarial examples leaves us a big hesitation when applying DNN models on safety-critical tasks such as autonomous vehicles and malware detection. These adversarial examples are intentionally crafted instances, either appearing in the train or test phase, which can fool the DNN models to make severe mistakes. Therefore, people are dedicated to devising more robust models to resist adversarial examples, but usually they are broken by new stronger attacks. This arms-race between adversarial attacks and defenses has been drawn increasing attention in recent years. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive overview on the frontiers and advances of adversarial attacks and their countermeasures. In particular, we give a detailed introduction of different types of attacks under different scenarios, including evasion and poisoning attacks, white-box and black box attacks. We will also discuss how the defending strategies develop to compete against these attacks, and how new attacks come out to break these defenses. Moreover, we will discuss the story of adversarial attacks and defenses in other data domains, especially in graph structured data. Then, we introduce DeepRobust, a Pytorch adversarial learning library which aims to build a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform to foster this research field. Finally, we summarize the tutorial with discussions on open issues and challenges about adversarial attacks and defenses.
