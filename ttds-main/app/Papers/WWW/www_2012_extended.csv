Accessing a wider pool of user feedback leads to an increasingly more accurate analysis of user tastes, effectively creating a ""rich get richer"" effect. This work aims at significantly lowering the entry barrier for creating music recommenders, through a paradigm coupling a public data source and a new collaborative filtering (CF) model. We claim that Internet radio stations form a readily available resource of abundant fresh human signals on music through their playlists, which are essentially cohesive sets of related tracks. In a way, our models rely on the knowledge of a diverse group of experts in lieu of the commonly used wisdom of crowds. Over several weeks, we aggregated publicly available playlists of thousands of Internet radio stations, resulting in a dataset encompassing millions of plays, and hundreds of thousands of tracks and artists. This provides the large scale ground data necessary to mitigate the cold start problem of new items at both mature and emerging services.",116

However, this raises unique challenges. To achieve complex goals such as keeping the recommender model up-to-date over time, we need to consider a number of external requirements. Generally, these requirements arise from the physical nature of the system, for instance the available computational resources. Ideally, we would like to design a system that does not deviate from the required outcome. Modeling such a system over time requires to describe the internal dynamics as a combination of the underlying recommender model and the its users' behavior. We propose to solve this problem by applying the principles of modern control theory - a powerful set of tools to deal with dynamical systems - to construct and maintain a stable and robust recommender system for dynamically evolving environments. In particular, we introduce a design principle by focusing on the dynamic relationship between the recommender system's performance and the number of new training samples the system requires. This enables us to automate the control other external factors such as the system's update frequency. We show that, by using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller, a recommender system is able to automatically and accurately estimate the required input to keep the output close to a pre-defined requirements. Our experiments on a standard rating dataset show that, by using a feedback loop between system performance and training, the trade-off between the effectiveness and efficiency of the system can be well maintained. We close by discussing the widespread applicability of our approach to a variety of scenarios that recommender systems face.",30

It typically associates a user with a group of like-minded users based on their preferences over all the items, and recommends to the user those items enjoyed by others in the group. However we find that two users with similar tastes on one item subset may have totally different tastes on another set. In other words, there exist many user-item subgroups each consisting of a subset of items and a group of like-minded users on these items. It is more natural to make preference predictions for a user via the correlated subgroups than the entire user-item matrix. In this paper, to find meaningful subgroups, we formulate the Multiclass Co-Clustering (MCoC) problem and propose an effective solution to it. Then we propose an unified framework to extend the traditional CF algorithms by utilizing the subgroups information for improving their top-N recommendation performance. Our approach can be seen as an extension of traditional clustering CF models. Systematic experiments on three real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",237

Client-only solutions to improve resource loading are attractive because they are immediately deployable, scalable, and secure. We present the first publicly known treatment of client-only solutions to understand how much they can improve mobile browser speed without infrastructure support. Leveraging an unprecedented set of web usage data collected from 24 iPhone users continuously over one year, we examine the three fundamental, orthogonal approaches a client-only solution can take: caching, prefetching, and speculative loading. Speculative loading, as is firstly proposed and studied in this work, predicts and speculatively loads the subresources needed to open a webpage once its URL is given. We show that while caching and prefetching are highly limited for mobile browsing, speculative loading can be significantly more effective. Empirically, we show that client-only solutions can improve the browser speed by about 1.4 second on average for websites visited by the 24 iPhone users. We also report the design, realization, and evaluation of speculative loading in a WebKit-based browser called Tempo. On average, Tempo can reduce browser delay by 1 second (~20%).",137

We present an infrastructure for measuring the precise energy used by a mobile browser to render web pages. We then measure the energy needed to render financial, e-commerce, email, blogging, news and social networking sites. Our tools are sufficiently precise to measure the energy needed to render individual web elements, such as cascade style sheets (CSS), Javascript, images, and plug-in objects. Our results show that for popular sites, downloading and parsing cascade style sheets and Javascript consumes a significant fraction of the total energy needed to render the page. Using the data we collected we make concrete recommendations on how to design web pages so as to minimize the energy needed to render the page. As an example, by modifying scripts on the Wikipedia mobile site we reduced by 30% the energy needed to download and render Wikipedia pages with no change to the user experience. We conclude by estimating the point at which offloading browser computations to a remote proxy can save energy on the phone.",246

A lack of awareness of this important mechanism potentially leads to resource-inefficient mobile applications. We perform the first network-wide, large-scale investigation of a particular type of application traffic pattern called periodic transfers where a handset periodically exchanges some data with a remote server every t seconds. Using packet traces containing 1.5 billion packets collected from a commercial cellular carrier, we found that periodic transfers are very prevalent in today's smartphone traffic. However, they are extremely resource-inefficient for both the network and end-user devices even though they predominantly generate very little traffic. This somewhat counter-intuitive behavior is a direct consequence of the adverse interaction between such periodic transfer patterns and the cellular network radio resource management policy. For example, for popular smartphone applications such as Facebook, periodic transfers account for only 1.7% of the overall traffic volume but contribute to 30% of the total handset radio energy consumption. We found periodic transfers are generated for various reasons such as keep-alive, polling, and user behavior measurements. We further investigate the potential of various traffic shaping and resource control algorithms. Depending on their traffic patterns, applications exhibit disparate responses to optimization strategies. Jointly using several strategies with moderate aggressiveness can eliminate almost all energy impact of periodic transfers for popular applications such as Facebook and Pandora.",146

Like the Web, Twitter has become a target for link farming, where users, especially spammers, try to acquire large numbers of follower links in the social network. Acquiring followers not only increases the size of a user's direct audience, but also contributes to the perceived influence of the user, which in turn impacts the ranking of the user's tweets by search engines.",483

Essentially, through analyzing inner social relationships in the criminal account community, we find that criminal accounts tend to be socially connected, forming a small-world network. We also find that criminal hubs, sitting in the center of the social graph, are more inclined to follow criminal accounts. Through analyzing outer social relationships between criminal accounts and their social friends outside the criminal account community, we reveal three categories of accounts that have close friendships with criminal accounts. Through these analyses, we provide a novel and effective criminal account inference algorithm by exploiting criminal accounts' social relationships and semantic coordinations.",371

One unfortunate phenomenon, however, poisons the competition and the fun: cheating. The costs of cheating span from industry-supported expenditures to detect and limit cheating, to victims' monetary losses due to cyber crime. This paper studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an online social network built on top of the world's dominant digital game delivery platform. We collected information about more than 12 million gamers connected in a global social network, of which more than 700 thousand have their profiles flagged as cheaters. We also collected in-game interaction data of over 10 thousand players from a popular multiplayer gaming server. We show that cheaters are well embedded in the social and interaction networks: their network position is largely indistinguishable from that of fair players. We observe that the cheating behavior appears to spread through a social mechanism: the presence and the number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with the likelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. Also, we observe that there is a social penalty involved with being labeled as a cheater: cheaters are likely to switch to more restrictive privacy settings once they are tagged and they lose more friends than fair players. Finally, we observe that the number of cheaters is not correlated with the geographical, real-world population density, or with the local popularity of the Steam Community.",47

Heavlin, ","Display advertising is the graphical advertising on the World Wide Web (WWW) that appears next to content on web pages, instant messaging (IM) applications, email, etc. Over the past decade, display ads have evolved from simple banner and pop-up ads to include various combinations of text, images, audio, video, and animations. As a market segment, display continues to show substantial growth potential, as evidenced by companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google actively vying for market share. As a sales process, display ads are typically sold in packages, the result of negotiations between sales and advertising agents. A key component to any successful business model in display advertising is sound pricing. Main objectives for on-line publishers (e.g. Amazon, YouTube, CNN) are maximizing revenue while managing their available inventory appropriately, and pricing must reflect these considerations.",40

Hence, identifying and targeting potential converters is of vital importance to boost campaign performance. This is often accomplished by marketers who define the user base of campaigns based on behavioral, demographic, search, social, purchase, and other characteristics. Such a process is manual and subjective, it often fails to utilize the full potential of targeting. In this paper we show that by using past converted users of campaigns and campaign meta-data (e.g., ad creatives, landing pages), we can combine disparate user information in a principled way to effectively and automatically target converters for new/existing campaigns. At the heart of our approach is a factor model that estimates the affinity of each user feature to a campaign using historical conversion data. In fact, our approach allows building a conversion model for a brand new campaign through campaign meta-data alone, and hence targets potential converters even before the campaign is run. Through extensive experiments, we show the superiority of our factor model approach relative to several other baselines. Moreover, we show that the performance of our approach at the beginning of a campaign's life is typically better than the other models even when they are trained using all conversion data after the campaign has completed. This clearly shows the importance and value of using historical campaign data in constructing an effective audience selection strategy for display advertising.",5

Bailey, ","Advertisers are demanding more accurate estimates of the impact of targeted advertisements, yet no study proposes an appropriate methodology to analyze the effectiveness of a targeted advertising campaign, and there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of targeted advertising as a whole. The targeted population is more likely to convert from advertising so the response lift between the targeted and untargeted group to the advertising is likely an overestimate of the impact of targeted advertising. We propose a difference-in-differences estimator to account for this selection bias by decomposing the impact of targeting into selection bias and treatment effects components. Using several large-scale online advertising campaigns, we test the effectiveness of targeted advertising on brand-related searches and clickthrough rates. We find that the treatment effect on the targeted group is about twice as large for brand-related searches, but naively estimating this effect without taking into account selection bias leads to an overestimation of the lift from targeting on brand-related searches by almost 1,000%.",179

Even small entity search benchmarks from TREC and INEX suggest that the entity catalog support thousands of entity types and tens to hundreds of millions of entities. The above targets raise many challenges, major ones being the design of highly compressed data structures in RAM for spotting and disambiguating entity mentions, and highly compressed disk-based annotation indices. These data structures cannot be readily built upon standard inverted indices. Here we present a Web scale entity annotator and annotation index. Using a new workload-sensitive compressed multilevel map, we fit statistical disambiguation models for millions of entities within 1.15GB of RAM, and spend about 0.6 core-milliseconds per disambiguation. In contrast, DBPedia Spotlight spends 158 milliseconds, Wikipedia Miner spends 21 milliseconds, and Zemanta spends 9.5 milliseconds. Our annotation indices use ideas from vertical databases to reduce storage by 30%. On 40x8 cores with 40x3 disk spindles, we can annotate and index, in about a day, a billion Web pages with two million entities and 200,000 types from Wikipedia. Index decompression and scan speed are comparable to MG4J.",21

One of the key challenges triggered by this growth is the ad-hoc querying, i.e., the ability to retrieve answers from semantic resources using natural language queries. This facilitates interaction with semantic resources for the users so they can benefit from the knowledge covered by semantic data without the complexities of semantic query languages. In this paper, we focus on semantic queries, where the aim is to retrieve objects belonging to a set of semantically related entities. An example of such an ad-hoc type query is ""Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon"". In order to address the task, we propose the SemSets retrieval model that exploits and combines traditional document-based information retrieval, link structure of the semantic data and entity membership in semantic sets, in order to provide the answers. The novelty of the approach lies in the utilization of semantic sets, i.e., groups of semantically related entities. We propose two approaches to identify such semantic sets from the knowledge bases; the first one requires involvement of an expert user knowledgeable of the data set structure, the second one is fully automatic and provides results that are comparable with those delivered by the expert users. As demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, the proposed model has the state-of-the-art performance on the SemSearch2011 data set, which has been designed especially for the semantic list search evaluation.",35

Herzig, Thanh Tran, ","Searching over heterogeneous structured data on the Web is challenging due to vocabulary and structure mismatches among different data sources. In this paper, we study two existing strategies and present a new approach to integrate additional data sources into the search process. The first strategy relies on data integration to mediate mismatches through upfront computation of mappings, based on which queries are rewritten to fit individual sources. The other extreme is keyword search, which does not require any up-front investment, but ignores structure information. Building on these strategies, we present a hybrid approach, which combines the advantages of both. Our approach does not require any upfront data integration, but also leverages the fine grained structure of the underlying data. For a structured query adhering to the vocabulary of just one source, the so-called seed query, we construct an entity relevance model (ERM), which captures the content and the structure of the seed query results. This ERM is then aligned on the fly with keyword search results retrieved from other sources and also used to rank these results. The outcome of our experiments using large-scale real-world data sets suggests that data integration leads to higher search effectiveness compared to keyword search and that our new hybrid approach consistently exceeds both strategies.",39

Two recent trends are making this problem harder. First, the increasing popularity of user-generated content (UGC) and online social networks (OSNs) create and reinforce such popularity distributions. Second, the recent trend of geo-replicating content across multiple PoPs spread around the world, done for improving quality of experience (QoE) for users and for redundancy reasons, can lead to unnecessary bandwidth costs. We build TailGate, a system that exploits social relationships, regularities in read access patterns, and time-zone differences to efficiently and selectively distribute long-tail content across PoPs. We evaluate TailGate using large traces from an OSN and show that it can decrease WAN bandwidth costs by as much as 80% as well as reduce latency, improving QoE. We deploy TailGate on PlanetLab and show that even in the case when imprecise social information is available, TailGate can still decrease the latency for accessing long-tail YouTube videos by a factor of 2.",63

An important class of such applications is interactive multimedia: games, animations, and interactive visualizations. Unlike many early web applications, these applications are latency sensitive and processing (CPU and graphics) intensive. When demands exceed available resources, application quality (e.g., frame rate) diminishes because it is hard to balance timeliness and utilization. The quality of ambitious web applications is also limited by single-threaded execution prevalent in the Web. Applications need to scale their quality, and thereby scale processing load, based on the resources that are available. We refer to this as scalable quality.",17

Unfortunately, blocking or deferring web crawler requests is not a viable solution due to economic consequences. We conduct a quantitative measurement study on the impact and cost of web crawling agents, seeking optimization points for this class of request. Based on our measurements, we present a practical caching approach for mitigating search engine overload, and implement the two-level cache scheme on a very busy web server. Our experimental results show that the proposed caching framework can effectively reduce the impact of search engine overload on service quality.",13

This results in an undesirable scenario where these offensive comments are the top rated ones. In this paper, we develop semi-supervised learning techniques to correct the bias in user ratings of comments. Our scheme uses a small number of comment labels in conjunction with user rating information to iteratively compute user bias and unbiased ratings for unlabeled comments. We show that the running time of each iteration is linear in the number of ratings, and the system converges to a unique fixed point. To select the comments to label, we devise an active learning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization. Our active learning method incrementally updates the risk for neighboring comments each time a comment is labeled, and thus can easily scale to large comment datasets. On real-life comments from Yahoo! News, our semi-supervised and active learning algorithms achieve higher accuracy than simple baselines, with few labeled examples.",9

However, due to the reason of profit or fame, people try to game the system by opinion spamming (e.g., writing fake reviews) to promote or demote some target products. For reviews to reflect genuine user experiences and opinions, such spam reviews should be detected. Prior works on opinion spam focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewers. However, a fake reviewer group (a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write fake reviews) is even more damaging as they can take total control of the sentiment on the target product due to its size. This paper studies spam detection in the collaborative setting, i.e., to discover fake reviewer groups. The proposed method first uses a frequent itemset mining method to find a set of candidate groups. It then uses several behavioral models derived from the collusion phenomenon among fake reviewers and relation models based on the relationships among groups, individual reviewers, and products they reviewed to detect fake reviewer groups. Additionally, we also built a labeled dataset of fake reviewer groups. Although labeling individual fake reviews and reviewers is very hard, to our surprise labeling fake reviewer groups is much easier. We also note that the proposed technique departs from the traditional supervised learning approach for spam detection because of the inherent nature of our problem which makes the classic supervised learning approach less effective. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms multiple strong baselines including the state-of-the-art supervised classification, regression, and learning to rank algorithms.",831

Lai, Haoqi Zhang, Aviv Zohar, ","Over the years, private file-sharing communities built on the BitTorrent protocol have developed their own policies and mechanisms for motivating members to share content and contribute resources. By requiring members to maintain a minimum ratio between uploads and downloads, private communities effectively establish credit systems, and with them full-fledged economies. We report on a half-year-long measurement study of DIME -- a community for sharing live concert recordings -- that sheds light on the economic forces affecting users in such communities. A key observation is that while the download of files is priced only according to the size of the file, the rate of return for seeding new files is significantly greater than for seeding old files. We find via a natural experiment that users react to such differences in resale value by preferentially consuming older files during a 'free leech' period. We consider implications of these finding on a user's ability to earn credits and meet ratio enforcements, focusing in particular on the relationship between visitation frequency and wealth and on low bandwidth users. We then share details from an interview with DIME moderators, which highlights the goals of the community based on which we make suggestions for possible improvement.",44

However, though some researchers have proposed effective methods for mining user habits such as behavior pattern mining, how to leverage the mined results for discovering similar users remains less explored. To this end, we propose a novel approach for conquering the sparseness of behavior pattern space and thus make it possible to discover similar mobile users with respect to their habits by leveraging behavior pattern mining. To be specific, first, we normalize the raw context log of each user by transforming the location-based context data and user interaction records to more general representations. Second, we take advantage of a constraint-based Bayesian Matrix Factorization model for extracting the latent common habits among behavior patterns and then transforming behavior pattern vectors to the vectors of mined common habits which are in a much more dense space. The experiments conducted on real data sets show that our approach outperforms three baselines in terms of the effectiveness of discovering similar mobile users with respect to their habits.",72

They offer an opportunity to investigate how a large-scale social system responds to exogenous or endogenous stimuli, and to disentangle the temporal, spatial and topical aspects of users' activity. Here we focus on spikes of collective attention in Twitter, and specifically on peaks in the popularity of hashtags. Users employ hashtags as a form of social annotation, to define a shared context for a specific event, topic, or meme. We analyze a large-scale record of Twitter activity and find that the evolution of hashtag popularity over time defines discrete classes of hashtags. We link these dynamical classes to the events the hashtags represent and use text mining techniques to provide a semantic characterization of the hashtag classes. Moreover, we track the propagation of hashtags in the Twitter social network and find that epidemic spreading plays a minor role in hashtag popularity, which is mostly driven by exogenous factors.",437

On one hand, a hashtag serves as a bookmark of content, which links tweets with similar topics; on the other hand, a hashtag serves as the symbol of a community membership, which bridges a virtual community of users. Are the real users aware of this dual role of hashtags? Is the dual role affecting their behavior of adopting a hashtag? Is hashtag adoption predictable? We take the initiative to investigate and quantify the effects of the dual role on hashtag adoption. We propose comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of how a user selects content tags as well as joins communities. Experiments using large scale Twitter datasets prove the effectiveness of the dual role, where both the content measures and the community measures significantly correlate to hashtag adoption on Twitter. With these measures as features, a machine learning model can effectively predict the future adoption of hashtags that a user has never used before.",367

Yet, access to this information via reasoning and querying is sometimes difficult, due to LOD's size, partial data inconsistencies and inherent noisiness. Machine Learning offers an alternative approach to exploiting LOD's data with the advantages that Machine Learning algorithms are typically robust to both noise and data inconsistencies and are able to efficiently utilize non-deterministic dependencies in the data. From a Machine Learning point of view, LOD is challenging due to its relational nature and its scale. Here, we present an efficient approach to relational learning on LOD data, based on the factorization of a sparse tensor that scales to data consisting of millions of entities, hundreds of relations and billions of known facts. Furthermore, we show how ontological knowledge can be incorporated in the factorization to improve learning results and how computation can be distributed across multiple nodes. We demonstrate that our approach is able to factorize the YAGO~2 core ontology and globally predict statements for this large knowledge base using a single dual-core desktop computer. Furthermore, we show experimentally that our approach achieves good results in several relational learning tasks that are relevant to Linked Data. Once a factorization has been computed, our model is able to predict efficiently, and without any additional training, the likelihood of any of the 4.3 ⋅ 1014 possible triples in the YAGO~2 core ontology.",437

To capture and describe such semantics, we propose Object Relation Network (ORN), a graph model representing the most probable meaning of the objects and their relations in an image. Guided and constrained by an ontology, ORN transfers the rich semantics in the ontology to image objects and the relations between them, while maintaining semantic consistency (e.g., a soccer player can kick a soccer ball, but cannot ride it). We present an automatic system which takes a raw image as input and creates an ORN based on image visual appearance and the guide ontology. We demonstrate various useful web applications enabled by ORNs, such as automatic image tagging, automatic image description generation, and image search by image.",44

We use a number of standard statistics, which measure the security of password distributions, to see if modelling the data using a simple distribution is effective. We then consider how much the password distributions from each site have in common, using password cracking as a metric. This shows that these distributions have enough high-frequency passwords in common to provide effective speed-ups for cracking passwords. Finally, as an alternative to a deterministic banned list, we will show how to stochastically shape the distribution of passwords, by occasionally asking users to choose a different password.",137

Asokan, ","Third-party applications (apps) drive the attractiveness of web and mobile application platforms. Many of these platforms adopt a decentralized control strategy, relying on explicit user consent for granting permissions that the apps request. Users have to rely primarily on community ratings as the signals to identify the potentially harmful and inappropriate apps even though community ratings typically reflect opinions about perceived functionality or performance rather than about risks. With the arrival of HTML5 web apps, such user-consent permission systems will become more widespread. We study the effectiveness of user-consent permission systems through a large scale data collection of Facebook apps, Chrome extensions and Android apps. Our analysis confirms that the current forms of community ratings used in app markets today are not reliable indicators of privacy risks of an app. We find some evidence indicating attempts to mislead or entice users into granting permissions: free applications and applications with mature content request more permissions than is typical; 'look-alike' applications which have names similar to popular applications also request more permissions than is typical. We also find that across all three platforms popular applications request more permissions than average.",276

The system, called Session Juggler, requires no server-side changes and no special software on the terminal beyond a modern web browser. This important property makes adoption much easier than with previous proposals. With Session Juggler users never enter their long term credential on the untrusted terminal. Instead, users log in to a web site using a smartphone app and then transfer the entire session, including cookies and all other session state, to the untrusted terminal. We show that Session Juggler works on all the Alexa top 100 sites except eight. Of those eight, five failures were due to the site enforcing IP session binding. We also show that Session Juggler works flawlessly with Facebook connect. Beyond login, Session Juggler also provides a secure logout mechanism where the trusted phone is used to kill the session. To validate the session juggling concept we conducted a number of web site surveys that are of independent interest. First, we survey how web sites bind a session token to a specific device and show that most use fairly basic techniques that are easily defeated. Second, we survey how web sites handle logout and show that many popular sites surprisingly do not properly handle logout requests.",26

In this paper, we address the problem of discovering topically meaningful communities from a social network. We assume that a persons' membership in a community is conditioned on its social relationship, the type of interaction and the information communicated with other members of that community. We propose generative models that can discover communities based on the discussed topics, interaction types and the social connections among people. In our models a person can belong to multiple communities and a community can participate in multiple topics. This allows us to discover both community interests and user interests based on the information and linked associations.

While network community detection has been ubiquitous, the task of collecting complete network data remains challenging in many real-world applications. Usually the collected network is incomplete with most of the edges missing. Commonly, in such networks, all nodes with attributes are available while only the edges within a few local regions of the network can be observed. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting communities in incomplete information networks with missing edges. We first learn a distance metric to reproduce the link-based distance between nodes from the observed edges in the local information regions. We then use the learned distance metric to estimate the distance between any pair of nodes in the network. A hierarchical clustering approach is proposed to detect communities within the incomplete information networks.

The Betweenness centrality is widely used in network analyses. Especially in a social network, the recursive computation of the betweenness centralities of vertices is performed for the community detection and finding the influential user in the network. Since a social network graph is frequently updated, it is necessary to update the betweenness centrality efficiently. When a graph is changed, the betweenness centralities of all the vertices should be recomputed from scratch using all the vertices in the graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an efficient algorithm which handles the update of the betweenness centralities of vertices in a graph. In this paper, we propose a method that efficiently reduces the search space by finding a candidate set of vertices whose betweenness centralities can be updated and computes their betweenness centeralities using candidate vertices only. As the cost of calculating the betweenness centrality mainly depends on the number of vertices to be considered, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the cost of calculation. The proposed algorithm allows the transformation of an existing algorithm which does not consider the graph update. Experimental results on large real datasets show that the proposed algorithm speeds up the existing algorithm 2 to 2418 times depending on the dataset.",112

Lang, Benjamin Moseley, Sergei Vassilvitskii, ","Most of the online advertising today is sold via an auction, which requires the advertiser to respond with a valid bid within a fraction of a second. As such, most advertisers employ bidding agents to submit bids on their behalf. The architecture of such agents typically has (1) an offline optimization phase which incorporates the bidder's knowledge about the market and (2) an online bidding strategy which simply executes the offline strategy. The online strategy is typically highly dependent on both supply and expected price distributions, both of which are forecast using traditional machine learning methods. In this work we investigate the optimum strategy of the bidding agent when faced with incorrect forecasts. At a high level, the agent can invest resources in improving the forecasts, or can tighten the loop between successive offline optimization cycles in order to detect errors more quickly. We show analytically that the latter strategy, while simple, is extremely effective in dealing with forecast errors, and confirm this finding with experimental evaluations.",18

However, it is often difficult for the user to choose from a list of query suggestions, and to understand the relation between an input query and suggested ones. In this paper, we propose a new method to present query suggestions to the user, which has been designed to help two popular query reformulation actions, namely, specialization (e.g. from ""nikon"" to ""nikon camera"" ) and parallel movement (e.g. from ""nikon camera"" to ""canon camera""). Using a query log collected from a popular commercial Web search engine, our prototype called SParQS classifies query suggestions into automatically generated categories and generates a label for each category. Moreover, SParQS presents some new entities as alternatives to the original query (e.g. ""canon"" in response to the query ""nikon""), together with their query suggestions classified in the same way as the original query's suggestions. We conducted a task-based user study to compare SParQS with a traditional ""flat list"" query suggestion interface. Our results show that the SParQS interface enables subjects to search more successfully than the flat list case, even though query suggestions presented were exactly the same in the two interfaces. In addition, the subjects found the query suggestions more helpful when they were presented in the SParQS interface rather than in a flat list.",41

Queries occur at nodes in the network, documents are also created by nodes in the same network, and the goal is to find the document that matches the query and is closest in network distance to the node issuing the query. In this paper, we present the ""Partitioned Multi-Indexing"" scheme, which provides an approximate solution to this problem. With m links in the network, after an offline ~O(m) pre-processing time, our scheme allows for social index operations (i.e., social search queries, as well as insertion and deletion of words into and from a document at any node), all in time ~O(1). Further, our scheme can be implemented on open source distributed streaming systems such as Yahoo! S4 or Twitter's Storm so that every social index operation takes ~O(1) processing time and network queries in the worst case, and just two network queries in the common case where the reverse index corresponding to the query keyword is much smaller than the memory available at any distributed compute node. Building on Das Sarma et al.'s approximate distance oracle, the worst-case approximation ratio of our scheme is ~O(1) for undirected networks. Our simulations on the social network Twitter as well as synthetic networks show that in practice, the approximation ratio is actually close to 1 for both directed and undirected networks.

We evaluate the results on two datasets and show that employing co-commenting patterns improves upon using content features alone, even with as few as two available comments per story.

In this approach, the similarity between the input query and the metadata of images is used to find relevant information. However, as the amount of available images grows, the number of relevant images also increases, all of them sharing very similar metadata but differing in other visual characteristics. This paper studies the influence of visual aesthetic quality in search results as a complementary attribute to relevance. By considering aesthetics, a new ranking parameter is introduced aimed at improving the quality at the top ranks when large amounts of relevant results exist. Two strategies for aesthetic rating inference are proposed: one based on visual content, another based on the analysis of user comments to detect opinions about the quality of images. The results of a user study with $58$ participants show that the comment-based aesthetic predictor outperforms the visual content-based strategy, and reveals that aesthetic-aware rankings are preferred by users searching for photographs on the Web.",58

Our main experimental findings are: (a) In terms of discriminative power which reflects statistical reliability, the proposed metrics, DIN#-nDCG and P+Q#, are comparable to intent recall and D#-nDCG, and possibly superior to α-nDCG; (b) In terms of preference agreement with intent recall, P+Q# is superior to other diversity metrics and therefore may be the most intuitive as a metric that emphasises diversity; and (c) In terms of preference agreement with effective precision, DIN#-nDCG is superior to other diversity metrics and therefore may be the most intuitive as a metric that emphasises relevance. Moreover, DIN#-nDCG may be the most intuitive as a metric that considers both diversity and relevance.

Networks inferred by transfer entropy can differ significantly from static friendship networks because most friendship links are not useful for predicting future dynamics.

Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed.

Suppose a mechanism designer (site owner) wishes to optimize an objective that is some function of the number and qualities of received contributions. When potential contributors are {\em strategic} agents, who decide whether to contribute or not to selfishly maximize their own utilities, is such a ""best contribution"" mechanism, Mb, adequate to implement an outcome that is optimal for the mechanism designer? We first show that in settings where a contribution's value is determined primarily by an agent's expertise, and agents only strategically choose whether to contribute or not, contests can implement optimal outcomes: for any reasonable objective, the rewards for the best and remaining contributions in Mb can always be chosen so that the outcome in the unique symmetric equilibrium of Mb maximizes the mechanism designer's utility. We also show how the mechanism designer can learn these optimal rewards when she does not know the parameters of the agents' utilities, as might be the case in practice. We next consider settings where a contribution's value depends on both the contributor's expertise as well as her effort, and agents endogenously choose how much effort to exert in addition to deciding whether to contribute. Here, we show that optimal outcomes can never be implemented by contests if the system can rank the qualities of contributions perfectly. However, if there is noise in the contributions' rankings, then the mechanism designer can again induce agents to follow strategies that maximize his utility. Thus imperfect rankings can actually help achieve implementability of optimal outcomes when effort is endogenous and influences quality.",40

Thus, our scenario is a location game in which sites choose to aggregate content at a certain point in user-preference space, and our choice of distance metric, Jacquard distance, induces a lattice structure on the game. We provide two variants of this scenario: one where users associate with the first site to enter amongst sites of equal distances, and a second where users choose uniformly between sites at equal distances. We show that subgame perfect Nash equilibria exist for both games. While it appears to be computationally hard to compute equilibria in both games, we show a polynomial-time satisficing strategy called Frontier Descent for the first game.

Agents who do not directly trust each other can transact through exchange of IOUs (obligations) along a chain of trust in the network. Credit networks are robust to intrusion, can enable transactions between strangers in exchange economies, and have the liquidity to support a high rate of transactions. We study the formation of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to extend each other. When each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents, and transacts directly only with those it trusts, the formation game is a potential game and all Nash equilibria are social optima. Moreover, the Nash equilibria of this game are equivalent in a very strong sense: the sequences of transactions that can be supported from each equilibrium credit network are identical. When we allow transactions over longer paths, the game may not admit a Nash equilibrium, and even when it does, the price of anarchy may be unbounded. Hence, we study two special cases. First, when agents have a shared belief about the trustworthiness of each agent, the networks formed in equilibrium have a star-like structure. Though the price of anarchy is unbounded, myopic best response quickly converges to a social optimum. Similar star-like structures are found in equilibria of heuristic strategies found via simulation. In addition, we simulate a second case where agents may have varying information about each others' trustworthiness based on their distance in a social network. Empirical game analysis of these scenarios suggests that star structures arise only when defaults are relatively rare, and otherwise, credit tends to be issued over short social distances conforming to the locality of information.",44

This paper shows that that post-click searcher behavior, such as cursor movement and scrolling, provides additional clues for better estimating document relevance. To this end, we identify patterns of examination and interaction behavior that correspond to viewing a relevant or non-relevant document, and design a new Post-Click Behavior (PCB) model to capture these patterns. To our knowledge, PCB is the first to successfully incorporate post-click searcher interactions such as cursor movements and scrolling on a landing page for estimating document relevance. We evaluate PCB on a dataset collected from a controlled user study that contains interactions gathered from hundreds of unique queries, result clicks, and page examinations. The experimental results show that PCB is significantly more effective than using page dwell time information alone, both for estimating the explicit judgments of each user, and for re-ranking the results using the estimated relevance.",183

However, the estimation of relevance and freshness, and especially the relative importance of these two aspects, are highly specific to the query and the time when the query was issued. In this work, we propose a unified framework for modeling the topical relevance and freshness, as well as their relative importance, based on click logs. We use click statistics and content analysis techniques to define a set of temporal features, which predict the right mix of freshness and relevance for a given query. Experimental results on both historical click data and editorial judgments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",11

For example, given a query for a specific flashlight, we aim to present actions such as reading reviews, watching demo videos, and finding the best price online. In an annotation study conducted over a random sample of user query sessions, we found that a large proportion of queries in query logs involve actions on entities, calling for an automatic approach to identifying relevant actions for entity-bearing queries. In this paper, we pose the problem of finding actions that can be performed on entities as the problem of probabilistic inference in a graphical model that captures how an entity bearing query is generated. We design models of increasing complexity that capture latent factors such as entity type and intended actions that determine how a user writes a query in a search box, and the URL that they click on. Given a large collection of real-world queries and clicks from a commercial search engine, the models are learned efficiently through maximum likelihood estimation using an EM algorithm. Given a new query, probabilistic inference enables recommendation of a set of pertinent actions and hosts. We propose an evaluation methodology for measuring the relevance of our recommended actions, and show empirical evidence of the quality and the diversity of the discovered actions.",112

In this work we examine the validity of this assumption, using data from a number of Web settings.

We perform a large-scale study of human wayfinding, in which, given a network of links between the concepts of Wikipedia, people play a game of finding a short path from a given start to a given target concept by following hyperlinks. What distinguishes our setup from other studies of human Web-browsing behavior is that in our case people navigate a graph of connections between concepts, and that the exact goal of the navigation is known ahead of time. We study more than 30,000 goal-directed human search paths and identify strategies people use when navigating information spaces. We find that human wayfinding, while mostly very efficient, differs from shortest paths in characteristic ways. Most subjects navigate through high-degree hubs in the early phase, while their search is guided by content features thereafter. We also observe a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency: conceptually simple solutions are more common but tend to be less efficient than more complex ones. Finally, we consider the task of predicting the target a user is trying to reach. We design a model and an efficient learning algorithm. Such predictive models of human wayfinding can be applied in intelligent browsing interfaces.",177

This has led the W3C to include the property path feature in the upcoming version of the standard, SPARQL 1.1.We tested several implementations of SPARQL 1.1 handling property path queries, and we observed that their evaluation methods for this class of queries have a poor performance even in some very simple scenarios. To formally explain this fact, we conduct a theoretical study of the computational complexity of property paths evaluation. Our results imply that the poor performance of the tested implementations is not a problem of these particular systems, but of the specification itself. In fact, we show that any implementation that adheres to the SPARQL 1.1 specification (as of November 2011) is doomed to show the same behavior, the key issue being the need for counting solutions imposed by the current specification. We provide several intractability results, that together with our empirical results, provide strong evidence against the current semantics of SPARQL 1.1 property paths. Finally, we put our results in perspective, and propose a natural alternative semantics with tractable evaluation, that we think may lead to a wide adoption of the language by practitioners, developers and theoreticians.",152

Question answering approaches have been proposed as a good compromise between intuitiveness and expressivity. Most question answering systems translate questions into triples which are matched against the RDF data to retrieve an answer, typically relying on some similarity metric. However, in many cases, triples do not represent a faithful representation of the semantic structure of the natural language question, with the result that more expressive queries can not be answered. To circumvent this problem, we present a novel approach that relies on a parse of the question to produce a SPARQL template that directly mirrors the internal structure of the question. This template is then instantiated using statistical entity identification and predicate detection. We show that this approach is competitive and discuss cases of questions that can be answered with our approach but not with competing approaches.",565

We present a solution, inspired by draft methods defined by the W3C where relational databases are directly mapped to RDF and OWL. Given a relational database schema and its integrity constraints, this direct mapping produces an OWL ontology, which, provides the basis for generating RDF instances. The semantics of this mapping is defined using Datalog. Two fundamental properties are information preservation and query preservation. We prove that our mapping satisfies both conditions, even for relational databases that contain null values. We also consider two desirable properties: monotonicity and semantics preservation. We prove that our mapping is monotone and also prove that no monotone mapping, including ours, is semantic preserving. We realize that monotonicity is an obstacle for semantic preservation and thus present a non-monotone direct mapping that is semantics preserving.",169

Although HTTPS can be used to prevent such attacks, its universal adoption is hindered by its performance cost and its inability to leverage caching at intermediate servers (such as CDN servers and caching proxies) while maintaining end-to-end security. To complement HTTPS, we revive an old idea from SHTTP, a protocol that offers end-to-end web integrity without confidentiality. We name the protocol HTTPi and give it an efficient design that is easy to deploy for today's web. In particular, we tackle several previously-unidentified challenges, such as supporting progressive page loading on the client's browser, handling mixed content, and defining access control policies among HTTP, HTTPi, and HTTPS content from the same domain. Our prototyping and evaluation experience show that HTTPi incurs negligible performance overhead over HTTP, can leverage existing web infrastructure such as CDNs or caching proxies without any modifications to them, and can make many of the mixed-content problems in existing HTTPS web sites easily go away. Based on this experience, we advocate browser and web server vendors to adopt HTTPi.",24

We construct two directed graphs over the same set of nodes (representing member profiles): the invitation graph and the navigation graph respectively.

Prior techniques only consider target entities present in a knowledge base and/or having a rich set of attributes. In this paper, we develop novel techniques that require no knowledge about the entities except their names.

Such disambiguated references can help enhance readability and draw similarities across different pieces of running text in an automated fashion. Previous research has tackled this problem by first forming a catalog of entities from a knowledge base, such as Wikipedia, and then using this catalog to disambiguate references in unseen text. However, most of the previously proposed models either do not use all text in the knowledge base, potentially missing out on discriminative features, or do not exploit word-entity proximity to learn high-quality catalogs. In this work, we propose topic models that keep track of the context of every word in the knowledge base; so that words appearing within the same context as an entity are more likely to be associated with that entity. Thus, our topic models utilize all text present in the knowledge base and help learn high-quality catalogs. Our models also learn groups of co-occurring entities thus enabling collective disambiguation. Unlike most previous topic models, our models are non-parametric and do not require the user to specify the exact number of groups present in the knowledge base. In experiments performed on an extract of Wikipedia containing almost 60,000 references, our models outperform SVM-based baselines by as much as 18% in terms of disambiguation accuracy translating to an increment of almost 11,000 correctly disambiguated references.",63

We compare several techniques for dealing with the large degree of noise in the dataset, and show how machine learning can be used to reduce errors caused by misleading tags and ambiguous visual content.

This functionality allows researchers to address an exciting set of questions: 1) How is information created and shared across geographical locations, 2) How do spatial and linguistic characteristics of people vary across regions, and 3) How to model human mobility. Although many attempts have been made for tackling these problems, previous methods are either complicated to be implemented or oversimplified that cannot yield reasonable performance. It is a challenge task to discover topics and identify users' interests from these geo-tagged messages due to the sheer amount of data and diversity of language variations used on these location sharing services.

Furthermore, we take the Markovian nature of a user's location into account. Our model exploits sparse factorial coding of the attributes, thus allowing us to deal with a large and diverse set of covariates efficiently.

Several techniques have been proposed to reconcile these conflicts by computing a weighted consensus based on source reliabilities, but these techniques focus on static values. When the real-world entity evolves over time, the noisy sources can delay, or even miss, reporting some of the real-world updates. This temporal aspect introduces two key challenges for consensus-based approaches: (i) due to delays, the mapping between a source's noisy observation and the real-world update it observes is unknown, and (ii) missed updates may translate to missing values for the consensus problem, even if the mapping is known. To overcome these challenges, we propose a formal approach that models the history of updates of the real-world entity as a hidden semi-Markovian process (HSMM). The noisy sources are modeled as observations of the hidden state, but the mapping between a hidden state (i.e. real-world update) and the observation (i.e. source value) is unknown. We propose algorithms based on Gibbs Sampling and EM to jointly infer both the history of real-world updates as well as the unknown mapping between them and the source values.

Most existing means rely on validators that check syntactic rules, and on runtime debuggers that check the behavior of a CSS style sheet on a particular document instance. However, the aim of most style sheets is to be applied to an entire set of documents, usually defined by some schema. To this end, a CSS style sheet is usually written w.r.t. a given schema. While usual debugging tools help reducing the number of bugs, they do not ultimately allow to prove properties over the whole set of documents to which the style sheet is intended to be applied. We propose a novel approach to fill this lack. We introduce ideas borrowed from the fields of logic and compile-time verification for the analysis of CSS style sheets. We present an original tool based on recent advances in tree logics. The tool is capable of statically detecting a wide range of errors (such as empty CSS selectors and semantically equivalent selectors), as well as proving properties related to sets of documents (such as coverage of styling information), in the presence or absence of schema information. This new tool can be used in addition to existing runtime debuggers to ensure a higher level of quality of CSS style sheets.",46

Similar behaviors are often used in a large number of applications, and facilitating their reuse offers considerable benefits. However, due to client-side specifics, such as multi-language implementation and extreme dynamicity, identifying and extracting code responsible for a certain behavior is difficult.

They enable us to access the deep content of web sites. Automatic form understanding unlocks this content for applications ranging from crawlers to meta-search engines and is essential for improving usability and accessibility of the web. Form understanding has received surprisingly little attention other than as component in specific applications such as crawlers. No comprehensive approach to form understanding exists and previous works disagree even in the definition of the problem. In this paper, we present OPAL, the first comprehensive approach to form understanding. We identify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in form understanding. On both problems OPAL pushes the state of the art: For form labeling, it combines signals from the text, structure, and visual rendering of a web page, yielding robust characterisations of common design patterns. In extensive experiments on the ICQ and TEL-8 benchmarks and a set of 200 modern web forms OPAL outperforms previous approaches by a significant margin. For form interpretation, we introduce a template language to describe frequent form patterns. These two parts of OPAL combined yield form understanding with near perfect accuracy (> 98%).",34

In such networks, information flow among members is driven by the tasks assigned to the network, and by the expertise of its members to complete those tasks. In this work, we analyze real-life collaborative networks to understand their common characteristics and how information is routed in these networks. Our study shows that collaborative networks exhibit significantly different properties compared with other complex networks. Collaborative networks have truncated power-law node degree distributions and other organizational constraints. Furthermore, the number of steps along which information is routed follows a truncated power-law distribution. Based on these observations, we developed a network model that can generate synthetic collaborative networks subject to certain structure constraints. Moreover, we developed a routing model that emulates task-driven information routing conducted by human beings in a collaborative network. Together, these two models can be used to study the efficiency of information routing for different types of collaborative networks -- a problem that is important in practice yet difficult to solve without the method proposed in this paper.",25

Unlike standard CF algorithms using relatively simple user and item features, recommendation in social networks poses the more complex problem of learning user preferences from a rich and complex set of user profile and interaction information. Many existing social CF methods have extended traditional CF matrix factorization, but have overlooked important aspects germane to the social setting. We propose a unified framework for social CF matrix factorization by introducing novel objective functions for training. Our new objective functions have three key features that address main drawbacks of existing approaches: (a) we fully exploit feature-based user similarity, (b) we permit direct learning of user-to-user information diffusion, and (c) we leverage co-preference (dis)agreement between two users to learn restricted areas of common interest. We evaluate these new social CF objectives, comparing them to each other and to a variety of (social) CF baselines, and analyze user behavior on live user trials in a custom-developed Facebook App involving data collected over five months from over 100 App users and their 37,000+ friends.",92

We propose a methodology for creating structured summaries of information, which we call metro maps. Our proposed algorithm generates a concise structured set of documents maximizing coverage of salient pieces of information. Most importantly, metro maps explicitly show the relations among retrieved pieces in a way that captures story development. We first formalize characteristics of good maps and formulate their construction as an optimization problem. Then we provide efficient methods with theoretical guarantees for generating maps.

We investigate the phenomenon of fame by mining a collection of news articles that spans the twentieth century, and also perform a side study on a collection of blog posts from the last 10 years. By analyzing mentions of personal names, we measure each person's time in the spotlight, and watch the distribution change from a century ago to a year ago. We expected to find a trend of decreasing durations of fame as news cycles accelerated and attention spans became shorter. Instead, we find a remarkable consistency through most of the period we study. Through a century of rapid technological and societal change, through the appearance of Twitter, communication satellites and the Internet, we do not observe a significant change in typical duration of celebrity. We also study the most famous of the famous, and find different results depending on our method for measuring duration of fame. With a method that may be thought of as measuring a spike of attention around a single narrow news story, we see the same result as before: stories last as long now as they did in 1930. A second method, which may be thought of as measuring the duration of public interest in a person, indicates that famous people's presence in the news is becoming longer rather than shorter, an effect most likely driven by the wider distribution and higher volume of media in modern times. Similar studies have been done with much shorter timescales specifically in the context of information spreading on Twitter and similar social networking site.

Recently a number of machine learning algorithms have been proposed for representing the data to be searched as (short) bit vectors and then using hashing to do rapid search. These algorithms have been limited in their applicability in that they are suited for only one type of task -- e.g. Spectral Hashing learns bit vector representations for retrieval, but not say, classification. In this paper we present a unified approach to learning bit vector representations for many applications that use nearest neighbor search. The main contribution is a single learning algorithm that can be customized to learn a bit vector representation suited for the task at hand. This broadens the usefulness of bit vector representations to tasks beyond just conventional retrieval. We propose a learning-to-rank formulation to learn the bit vector representation of the data. LambdaRank algorithm is used for learning a function that computes a task-specific bit vector from an input data vector. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art nearest neighbor methods on a number of real world text and image classification and retrieval datasets.

Selecting a (near-)optimal set of services for a composition in terms of QoS is crucial when many functionally equivalent services are available. With the advent of Cloud Computing, both the number of such services and their distribution across the network are rising rapidly, increasing the impact of the network on the QoS of such compositions. Despite this, current approaches do not differentiate between the QoS of services themselves and the QoS of the network. Therefore, the computed latency differs substantially from the actual latency, resulting in suboptimal QoS for service compositions in the cloud. Thus, we propose a network-aware approach that handles the QoS of services and the QoS of the network independently. First, we build a network model in order to estimate the network latency between arbitrary services and potential users. Our selection algorithm then leverages this model to find compositions that will result in a low latency given an employed execution policy. In our evaluation, we show that our approach efficiently computes compositions with much lower latency than current approaches.",152

Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization algorithms select services in order to adapt workflows to the non-functional requirements of the user. With increasing number of services in a workflow, previous approaches fail to achieve a sufficient reliability. Moreover, expensive ad-hoc replanning is required to deal with service failures. The major problem with such sequential application of planning and replanning is that it ignores the potential costs during the initial planning and they consequently are hidden from the decision maker. Our basic idea to overcome this substantial problem is to compute a QoS optimized selection of service clusters that includes a sufficient number of backup services for each service employed. To support the human decision maker in the service selection task, our approach considers the possible repair costs directly in the initial composition. On the basis of a multi-objective approach and using a suitable service selection interface, the decision maker can select compositions in line with his/her personal risk preferences.",44

Migrating Web applications to Cloud services and integrating Cloud services into existing computing infrastructures is non-trivial. It leads to new challenges that often require innovation of paradigms and practices at all levels: technical, cultural, legal, regulatory, and social. The key problem in mapping Web applications to virtualized Cloud services is selecting the best and compatible mix of software images (e.g., Web server image) and infrastructure services to ensure that Quality of Service (QoS) targets of an application are achieved. The fact that, when selecting Cloud services, engineers must consider heterogeneous sets of criteria and complex dependencies between infrastructure services and software images, which are impossible to resolve manually, is a critical issue. To overcome these challenges, we present a framework (called CloudGenius) which automates the decision-making process based on a model and factors specifically for Web server migration to the Cloud. CloudGenius leverages a well known multi-criteria decision making technique, called Analytic Hierarchy Process, to automate the selection process based on a model, factors, and QoS parameters related to an application. An example application demonstrates the applicability of the theoretical CloudGenius approach. Moreover, we present an implementation of CloudGenius that has been validated through experiments.",206

While search systems are superior machines to get world-wide information, the opinions collected within friends and expert/local communities can ultimately determine our decisions: human curiosity and creativity is often capable of going much beyond the capabilities of search systems in scouting ""interesting"" results, or suggesting new, unexpected search directions. Such personalized interaction occurs in most times aside of the search systems and processes, possibly instrumented and mediated by a social network; when such interaction is completed and users resort to the use of search systems, they do it through new queries, loosely related to the previous search or to the social interaction. In this paper we propose CrowdSearcher, a novel search paradigm that embodies crowds as first-class sources for the information seeking process. CrowdSearcher aims at filling the gap between generalized search systems, which operate upon world-wide information - including facts and recommendations as crawled and indexed by computerized systems - with social systems, capable of interacting with real people, in real time, to capture their opinions, suggestions, emotions. The technical contribution of this paper is the discussion of a model and architecture for integrating computerized search with human interaction, by showing how search systems can drive and encapsulate social systems. In particular we show how social platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, can be used for crowdsourcing search-related tasks; we demonstrate our approach with several prototypes and we report on our experiment upon real user communities.",140

In order not to expose the whole user base to the new service, the mean user satisfaction rate is estimated by exposing the service only to a few uniformly chosen random users. In a recent work, Backstrom and Kleinberg, defined the notion of network bucket testing for social services. In this context, users' interactions are only valid for measurement if some minimal number of their friends are also given the service. The goal is to estimate the mean user satisfaction rate while providing the service to the least number of users. This constraint makes uniform sampling, which is optimal for the traditional case, grossly inefficient. In this paper we introduce a simple general framework for designing and evaluating sampling techniques for network bucket testing. The framework is constructed in a way that sampling algorithms are only required to generate sets of users to which the service should be provided. Given an algorithm, the framework produces an unbiased user satisfaction rate estimator and a corresponding variance bound for any network and any user satisfaction function. Furthermore, we present several simple sampling algorithms that are evaluated using both synthetic and real social networks.
