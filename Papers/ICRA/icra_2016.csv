Koditschek,","We reconsider the problem of reactive navigation in sphere worlds, i.e., the construction of a vector field over a compact, convex Euclidean subset punctured by Euclidean disks, whose flow brings a Euclidean disk robot from all but a zero measure set of initial conditions to a designated point destination, with the guarantee of no collisions along the way. We use power diagrams, generalized Voronoi diagrams with additive weights, to identify the robot's collision free convex neighborhood, and to generate the value of our proposed candidate solution vector field at any free configuration via evaluation of an associated convex optimization problem. We prove that this scheme generates a continuous flow with the specified properties. We also propose its practical extension to the nonholonomically constrained kinematics of the standard differential drive vehicle."

In this paper, we present a novel approach to motion planning using Gaussian processes. In contrast to most existing trajectory optimization algorithms, which rely on a discrete state parameterization in practice, we represent the continuous-time trajectory as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP) generated by a linear time-varying stochastic differential equation. We then provide a gradient-based optimization technique that optimizes continuous-time trajectories with respect to a cost functional. By exploiting GP interpolation, we develop the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP), that finds optimal trajectories parameterized by a small number of states. We benchmark our algorithm against recent trajectory optimization algorithms by solving 7-DOF robotic arm planning problems in simulation and validate our approach on a real 7-DOF WAM arm."

Pokorny,Ken Goldberg,Danica Kragic,","Cloud Robotics techniques based on Learning from Demonstrations suggest promising alternatives to manual programming of robots and autonomous vehicles. One challenge is that demonstrated trajectories may vary dramatically: it can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a system to learn control policies unless the trajectories are clustered into meaningful consistent subsets. Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Fréchet distance."

Pokorny,Danica Kragic,Lydia E. Kavraki,Ken Goldberg,","Recent progress in motion planning has made it possible to determine homotopy inequivalent trajectories between an initial and terminal configuration in a robot configuration space. Current approaches have however either assumed the knowledge of differential one-forms related to a skeletonization of the collision space, or have relied on a simplicial representation of the free space. Both of these approaches are currently however not yet practical for higher dimensional configuration spaces. We propose 2D topological task projections (TTPs): mappings from the configuration space to 2-dimensional spaces where simplicial complex filtrations and persistent homology can identify topological properties of the high-dimensional free configuration space. Our approach only requires the availability of collision free samples to identify winding centers that can be used to determine homotopy inequivalent trajectories. We propose the Winding Augmented RRT and RRT* (WA-RRT/RRT*) algorithms using which homotopy inequivalent trajectories can be found. We evaluate our approach in experiments with configuration spaces of planar linkages with 2-10 degrees of freedom. Results indicate that our approach can reliably identify suitable topological task projections and our proposed WA-RRT and WA-RRT* algorithms were able to identify a collection of homotopy inequivalent trajectories in each considered configuration space dimension."

Resource-awareness facilitate better resource allocation on global system level, e.g. when a humanoid robot needs to distribute and schedule a wide variety of concurrent algorithms. We present a motion planning approach that employs self-monitoring concepts in order to identify the difficulty of the planning problem. Resources are requested dynamically and adapted based on problem difficulty and current planning progress. We show how dynamic adaptation of resource allocation on algorithmic level can reduce the system workload as compared to static resource allocation while meeting Quality of Service (QoS) measures such as average workload or efficiency. We evaluate our approach both in several synthetic setups with varying difficulty and with the humanoid robot ARMAR-4."

Our objective is to plan motions for a team of homogeneous micro air vehicles (MAVs) toward a set of goals, such that each MAV at any state at any moment follows an action policy toward a unique goal, while considering action uncertainty. We pursue an efficient formulation by first considering a deterministic abstraction of the stochastic system based on approximate initial paths. These deterministic and decoupled sub-problems are converted to the stochastic domain and improved by individual agents or a subset of agents. The resulting decoupled formulation requires processing of a partial state space and enables online operation given applications with emerging tasks."

Lee,","This paper presents a new approach for fast collision detection in high dimensional configuration spaces for Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) motion planning. The proposed method is based upon Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) that are learned using an incremental Expectation Maximization clustering algorithm trained online using exemplars provided by a slow, conventional kinematic-based collision detection routine. The number of collision checks needed can be drastically reduced using a biased random sampling from the learned GMM distribution, and the learned models are continually refined and improved as the RRT planning algorithm proceeds. Our proposed method is demonstrated on several example applications and experimental results show marked improvement in computational efficiency over previous approaches."

This structure builds upon the so-called bubble, which is a local volume of free C-space, easily computed using the distance information in the workspace. We show how the same distance information can be used to compute the bur that can reach substantially beyond the boundary of the bubble. It is shown how burs can be used to form a rapidly exploring bur tree (RBT): a space-filling tree that resembles RRT. Such a structure can easily be used within a suitably tailored path planning algorithm. Simulation study shows how the RBT-based algorithm outperforms the classical RRT-based method."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487118,Path planning for robotic manipulators using expanded bubbles of free C-space,"Adnan Ademovic,Bakir Lacevic,","This paper presents a novel method for using volumetric information in the C-space for generating collision-free paths for robotic manipulators in the presence of obstacles. The method is based on the RRT paradigm, i.e., incrementally building trees in C-space in order to connect the initial configuration to the final one. Bubbles of free C-space are used within a carefully modified extend procedure to add lengthy edges to the tree. In particular, we propose an expanded version of the bubble, which enables even more efficient exploration. The method is validated and compared to other planning algorithms within a simulation study that includes several types of manipulators and obstacle scenarios."

The MSPP algorithm leverages a multi-scale representation of the environment in n dimensions encoded in tree structure constructed by recursive dyadic partitioning of the search space. We first present a new method to compute the graph neighbors in order to reduce the complexity of each iteration, from O(|V|2) to O(|V| log |V|). We then show how to delay expensive intermediate computations until we know that new information will be required, hence saving time by not operating on information that is never used during the search. Finally, we present a way to remove the very expensive need to calculate a full multi-scale map with the use of sampling and derive an upper bound on the probability of failure as a function of the number of samples."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487120,Hierarchical rejection sampling for informed kinodynamic planning in high-dimensional spaces,"Tobias Kunz,Andrea Thomaz,Henrik Christensen,","We present hierarchical rejection sampling (HRS) to improve the efficiency of asymptotically optimal sampling-based planners for high-dimensional problems with differential constraints. Pruning nodes and rejecting samples that cannot improve the currently best solution have been shown to improve performance for certain problems. We show that in high-dimensional domains this improvement can be so large that rejecting samples becomes the bottleneck of the algorithm because almost all samples are rejected. This contradicts general wisdom that collision checking is always the bottleneck of sampling-based planners. Only samples in the informed subset of the state space can potentially improve the current solution. For systems without differential constraints the informed subset forms an ellipsoid, which can be parameterized and sampled directly. For systems with differential constraints the informed subset is more complicated and no such direct sampling methods exist. HRS improves the efficiency of finding samples within the informed subset without parameterizing it explicitly. Thus, it can also be applied to systems with differential constraints for which a steering method is available. In our experiments we demonstrate efficiency improvements of an RRT* planner of up to two orders of magnitude."

The sensor consists of multiple electrode layers printed on a Flexible Printed Circuit Board (FPCB) and a dielectric substrate into which the CMCs are dispersed. The dielectric layer is simply put on the top of the FPCB. Thus, the sensor provides ease of fabrication and robustness against repetitive external contacts because the dielectric layer protects the electrodes. The electrical properties of the sensor are changed when an object approaches or touches the sensor. The sensor uses a capacitive sensing mode for tactile sensing and an inductive sensing mode for proximity sensing. CMCs amplify the change of the sensor signal because of electrical impedance formed by the CMCs, and thus, the sensitivity of the sensor increases. We fabricate the prptotype sensor with the dimensions of 30 × 30 × 0.6 mm3, and with 3 mm spatial-resolution. The sensor detects the applied pressure up to 330 kPa and the distance of an object as much as 150 mm away."

The estimation of the unknown force applied to the seismic mass is based on the deconvolution of the noisy measurement of the mass displacement which has an under-damped dynamic. Despite their high performances in terms of linearity, resolution and measurement range, such force sensors are extremely sensitive to low frequency environmental mechanical disturbances. They are also sensitive to the temperature evolution of the ambient air. The evaluation, modeling and compensation of such environmental disturbances have to be specifically studied in the context of magnetic springs associated to a macroscopic seismic mass. This article presents an estimation and a passive compensation strategy of the low frequency and non-stationary mechanical disturbances that is based on a differential principle. This approach is applied to a nanoforce sensor based on diamagnetic levitation developed in the last decade and gives an uncertainty below the nanonewton level."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487123,Improved normal and shear tactile force sensor performance via Least Squares Artificial Neural Network (LSANN),"Meng Yee Chuah,Sangbae Kim,","This paper presents a new approach to the characterization of tactile array sensors that aims to reduce the computational time needed for convergence to obtain a useful estimator for normal and shear forces. This is achieved by breaking up the sensor characterization into two parts: a linear regression portion using multivariate least squares regression, and a nonlinear regression portion using a neural network as a multi-input, multi-output function approximator. This procedure has been termed Least Squares Artificial Neural Network (LSANN). By applying LSANN on the 2nd generation MIT Cheetah footpad, the convergence speed for the estimator of the normal and shear forces is improved by 59.2% compared to using only the neural network alone. The normalized root mean squared error between the two methods are nearly identical at 1.17% in the normal direction, and 8.30% and 10.14% in the shear directions. This approach could have broader implications in greatly reducing the amount of time needed to train a contact force estimator for a large number of tactile sensor arrays (i.e. in robotic hands and skin)."

Lepora,","Tactile manipulation is the ability to control objects in real-time using the sense of touch. Here we examine tactile manipulation from the perspective of active touch with a biomimetic tactile sensor, which combines tactile perception with control of sensor location. Experiments are performed with the tactile fingertip mounted as end effector to a robot arm, to manipulate (roll) a cylinder in contact with the fingertip. Performance is validated with offline (cross-validation) and online (real-time operation) assessments. Location perception is finer than the sensor resolution, leading to superresolved tactile manipulation along a complex trajectory. However, the original methods were non-robust to large unknown disturbances of object location, necessitating modification of the perceptual process to diminish prior beliefs relative to past posterior beliefs. In consequence robust and accurate tactile manipulation was attained. In general, it appears there is a trade-off between the responsiveness to unknown change and manipulation accuracy, which must be set appropriately for each task."

A sequential Monte Carlo observation algorithm is proposed, which uses a fast and accurate collision detection algorithm as a reference model for the contacts between complex shaped parts. The main contribution of the paper is the extension of the classic random motion model in the propagation step with sampling methods known from the domain of probabilistic roadmap planning in order to increase the sample density in narrow passages of the configuration space. As a result, the observation performance can be improved and a risk of sample impoverishment reduced. Experimental validation is provided for a peg-in-hole task executed by a lightweight-robot arm equipped with joint torque sensors."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487126,Robotic grasp control with high-resolution combined tactile and proximity sensing,"Kazuhiro Shimonomura,Hiroto Nakashima,Kentaro Nozu,","We have proposed a multimodal sensing with optical device and its application to robotic grasp control. The proposed device provides both tactile and proximity information with high spatial resolution on the same scale of coordinates, that is necessary while grasping small and complicated-shaped objects using a robotic hand. In our proposed device, tactile information is obtained as infrared image through a light conductive plate, which allows the capture of a tactile image of high spatial resolution using a camera. Proximity information is detected based on stereo matching of a pair of images obtained by two cameras. By using a compound-eye camera, we constructed a compact device so that the sensor can be mounted on the robotic hand. Through experiments with 6 DoF robotic arm and robotic hand equipped with the proposed sensing device, we show that the robotic motion for searching, approaching and grasping can be controlled based on sensor information obtained from only the proposed device. In addition, our combined sensing approach enables an adaptive grasping motion of the robotic hand."

This paper presents a machine learning approach for estimating forces when no force sensors are present on the robot platform. In the training phase, the robot executes the desired manipulation tasks under controlled conditions with systematically varied parameter sets. All internal sensor data, in the presented case from more than 100 sensors, as well as the force exerted by the robot are recorded. Using Transfer Entropy, a statistical model is learned that identifies the subset of sensors relevant for torque estimation in the given task. At runtime, the model is used to accurately estimate the torques exerted during manipulations of the demonstrated kind. The feasibility of the approach is shown in a setting where a robotic manipulator operates a torque wrench to fasten a screw nut. Torque estimates with an accuracy of well below ±1Nm are achieved. A strength of the presented model is that no prior knowledge of the robot's kinematics, mass distribution or sensor instrumentation is required."

To fully realize this benefit, tactile systems must support real-time data acquisition over a massive number of tactile sensor elements. We present a novel approach for scalable tactile data acquisition using compressed sensing. We first demonstrate that the tactile data is amenable to compressed sensing techniques. We then develop a solution for fast data sampling, compression, and reconstruction that is suited for tactile system hardware and has potential for reducing the wiring complexity. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our technique on simulated tactile sensor networks. Our evaluations show that compressed sensing, with a compression ratio of 3 to 1, can achieve higher signal acquisition accuracy than full data acquisition of noisy sensor data."

Howe,","Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires grasping a wide range of objects. Tactile sensing is presumed to provide essential information in this context, but there has been little work examining the tactile sensor signals produced during realistic manipulation tasks. This paper presents tactile sensor data from grasping a generic object in thousands of trials. Position error between the hand and object was varied to model the uncertainty in real-world grasping, and a grasp outcome prediction was done using only tactile sensors. Results show that tactile signals are highly variable despite good repeatability in grasping conditions. The observed variability appears to be intrinsic to the grasping process, due to the mechanical coupling between fingers as they contact the object in parallel, as well as numerous factors such as frictional effects and inaccuracies in the robot hand. Using a simple machine learning algorithm, grasp outcome prediction based purely on tactile sensors is not reliable enough for real-world responsibilities. These results have implications for improved tactile sensor system and controller design, as well as signal processing and machine learning methods."

Lilienthal,Danica Kragic,Yasemin Bekiroglu,","Predicting grasp success is useful for avoiding failures in many robotic applications. Based on reasoning in wrench space, we address the question of how well analytic grasp success prediction works if tactile feedback is incorporated. Tactile information can alleviate contact placement uncertainties and facilitates contact modeling. We introduce a wrench-based classifier and evaluate it on a large set of real grasps. The key finding of this work is that exploiting tactile information allows wrench-based reasoning to perform on a level with existing methods based on learning or simulation. Different from these methods, the suggested approach has no need for training data, requires little modeling effort and is computationally efficient. Furthermore, our method affords task generalization by considering the capabilities of the grasping device and expected disturbance forces/moments in a physically meaningful way."

Howard,","Muscle activity monitoring or Electromyography (EMG) is useful in gait analysis, injury prevention, computer or robot interfaces and assisting patients with communication difficulties. However, EMG is typically invasive or obtrusive, expensive and difficult to use for untrained users. A possible solution is textile-based surface EMG (sEMG) integrated into clothing and used as a wearable device. This is, however, challenging due to (i) uncertainties in the electrical properties of conductive threads used to construct electrodes, (ii) imprecise fabrication technologies (e.g., embroidery, sewing), and (iii) a lack of standardisation in the choice of design variables. This paper, for the first time, provides a design guide for such sensors by performing a thorough examination of the effect of design variables on sEMG quality. Electrical characterisation and sEMG measurements are performed, considering the effects of manufacturing imprecision. Results show that the imprecisions in digital embroidery lead to a trade-off between low electrode resistance and high consistency. An optimum set of variables for this trade-off is identified and tested with sEMG during a variable force isometric grip exercise with n=6 participants and compared with traditional gel-based electrodes. Results show that thread-based electrodes provide a similar level of sensitivity to force variation as gel-based electrodes with about 90% correlation with expected linear behaviour."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487132,Terrain contact modeling and classification for ATVs,"Mario Gianni,Manuel A. Ruiz Garcia,Federico Ferri,Fiora Pirri,","We present a method for estimating the contact event between sensor-free active subtracks, named flippers, of an articulated tracked vehicle (ATV) and the terrain surface. The main idea is to consider both the moving base link and unexpected collisions dynamics as disturbances of the flipper dynamics. On this basis we extend the generalized momenta fault detection and isolation (FDI) method to compute the residual dynamics of the flippers, without resorting to additional sensory information. Under the hypothesis that the residual signal presents disturbance patterns that can be discriminated by those generated by unexpected collisions of the flippers with the ground, we apply a classification method to recover the contact event. The wavelet packet transform is used to decompose the signal and to generate a feature space for the residual, from the different subbands. Finally, sparse SVM, based on feature selection discriminates the contact signal."

Stork,,,","We present a probabilistic model for joint representation of several sensory modalities and action parameters in a robotic grasping scenario. Our non-linear probabilistic latent variable model encodes relationships between grasp-related parameters, learns the importance of features, and expresses confidence in estimates. The model learns associations between stable and unstable grasps that it experiences during an exploration phase. We demonstrate the applicability of the model for estimating grasp stability, correcting grasps, identifying objects based on tactile imprints and predicting tactile imprints from object-relative gripper poses. We performed experiments on a real platform with both known and novel objects, i.e., objects the robot trained with, and previously unseen objects. Grasp correction had a 75% success rate on known objects, and 73% on new objects. We compared our model to a traditional regression model that succeeded in correcting grasps in only 38% of cases."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487134,Movement primitives with multiple phase parameters,"Marco Ewerton,Guilherme Maeda,Gerhard Neumann,Viktor Kisner,,,,","Movement primitives are concise movement representations that can be learned from human demonstrations, support generalization to novel situations and modulate the speed of execution of movements. The speed modulation mechanisms proposed so far are limited though, allowing only for uniform speed modulation or coupling changes in speed to local measurements of forces, torques or other quantities. Those approaches are not enough when dealing with general velocity constraints. We present a movement primitive formulation that can be used to non-uniformly adapt the speed of execution of a movement in order to satisfy a given constraint, while maintaining similarity in shape to the original trajectory. We present results using a 4-DoF robot arm in a minigolf setup."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487135,Learning optimal navigation actions for foresighted robot behavior during assistance tasks,"AbdElMoniem Bayoumi,Maren Bennewitz,","We present an approach to learn optimal navigation actions for assistance tasks in which the robot aims at efficiently reaching the final navigation goal of a human where service has to be provided. Always following the human at a close distance might hereby result in inefficient trajectories, since people regularly do not move on the shortest path to their destination (e.g., they move to grab the phone or make a note). Therefore, a service robot should infer the human's intended navigation goal and compute its own motion based on that prediction. We developed an approach that applies reinforcement learning to get a Q-function that determines for each pair of the robot's and human's relative positions the best navigation action for the robot. Our approach applies a prediction of the human's motion based on a softened Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP is independent from the navigation learning framework and is learned beforehand on previously observed trajectories. We thoroughly evaluated our method in simulation and on a real robot. As the experimental results show, our approach leads to foresighted navigation behavior and significantly reduces the path length and completion time compared to naive following strategies."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487136,List prediction applied to motion planning,"Abhijeet Tallavajhula,Sanjiban Choudhury,Sebastian Scherer,Alonzo Kelly,","There is growing interest in applying machine learning to motion planning. Potential applications are predicting an initial seed for trajectory optimization, predicting an effective heuristic for search based planning, and even predicting a planning algorithm for adaptive motion planning systems. In these situations, providing only a single prediction is unsatisfactory. It leads to many scenarios where the prediction suffers a high loss. In this paper, we advocate list prediction. Each predictor in a list focusses on different regions in the space of environments. This overcomes the shortcoming of a single predictor, and improves overall performance. A framework for list prediction, ConseqOpt, already exists. Our contribution is an extensive domain-specific treatment. We provide a rigorous and clear exposition of the procedure for training a list of predictors. We provide experimental results on a spectrum of motion planning applications. Each application contributes to understanding the behavior of list prediction. We observe that the benefit of list prediction over a single prediction is significant, irrespective of the application."

In the literature, this problem is classically solved by multi-task prioritized approaches, where the priority of each task is determined by a weight function, describing the task strict/soft priority. In this paper, we propose to leverage machine learning techniques to learn the temporal profiles of the task priorities, represented as parametrized weight functions: we automatically determine their parameters through a stochastic optimization procedure. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method on a simulated 7 DOF Kuka LWR and both a simulated and a real Kinova Jaco arm. We compare the performance of our approach to a state-of-the-art method based on soft task prioritization, where the task weights are typically hand-tuned."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7487138,Stream-based Active Learning for efficient and adaptive classification of 3D objects,"Alexander Narr,Rudolph Triebel,Daniel Cremers,","We present a new Active Learning approach for classifying objects from streams of 3D point cloud data. The major problems here are the non-uniform occurrence of class instances and the unbalanced numbers of samples per class. We show that standard online learning methods based on decision trees perform comparably bad for such data streams, which are however particularly relevant for mobile robots that need to learn semantics persistently. To address this, we use Mondrian forests (MF), a recent online learning algorithm that is independent on the data order. We present an extension of that algorithm and show that MF are less overconfident than standard Random Forests. In experiments on the KITTI benchmark, we show that this leads to a substantially improved classification performance for data streams, rendering our approach very attractive for lifelong robot learning applications."

Many existing trajectory representations have poor generalization capabilities since they are built on trajectory coordinates that depend on the context in which the motion is recorded. In order to generalize, the user is typically required to perform a large number of varied demonstrations. This paper instead emphasizes the usefulness of an invariant trajectory representation to separate essential motion information from context-specific information of the recorded demonstrations. The invariants are interpreted as the control inputs of a dynamical system describing the evolution of the trajectory. New trajectories are generated for novel situations as the solution of a constrained optimal control problem in which context-specific information of the novel situation is encoded in the constraints. Results indicate how, starting from only a single demonstration, new trajectories can be generated in novel situations while maintaining similarity with the original demonstration. Invariance in trajectory representations therefore proves useful to reduce the number of necessary demonstrations to learn and apply new motions."

The method is based on the combination of a model-based policy that is trained off-line in simulation and sends high-level commands to a model-free controller that executes these commands on the physical robot. This low-level controller simultaneously learns and adapts a local model of dynamics on-line and computes optimal controls under the learned model. The high-level policy is trained using a combination of trajectory optimization and neural network learning, while considering physical limitations such as limited sensors and communication delays. The entire system runs in real-time on the robot's computer and uses only on-board sensors. We demonstrate successful policy execution on a range of tasks such as leaning, hand reaching, and robust balancing behaviors atop a tilting base on the physical robot and in simulation."

Learning time-critical tasks depends furthermore on the ability to model temporal elements in demonstrations. This paper proposes a modeling framework based on Petri nets capable of modeling these aspects in a programming by demonstration context. In the proposed approach, models of tasks are constructed from segmented demonstrations as task Petri nets, which can be executed as discrete controllers for reproduction. We present algorithms that automatically construct models from demonstrations, showing how elements of time-critical tasks can be mapped into task Petri net elements. The approach is validated by an experiment in which a robot plays a musical passage on a keyboard."

It aims at modeling the goal motion trajectories through human demonstration. However, in lower exoskeleton control, the physical human-robot interaction is changing from pilot to pilot or even for one pilot in different walking patterns. This characteristic requires that the exoskeletons should have the ability to learn and adapt the motion trajectories as well as controllers online. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Interactive Learning (HIL) strategy which reduces the complexity of the exoskeleton sensory system and is able to handle varying interaction dynamics. The proposed HIL strategy is composed of two learning hierarchies, namely, high-level motion learning and low-level controller learning. The Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) combined with Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) are employed to model and learn the motion trajectories, while reinforcement learning (RL) is used to learn the model-based controller. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed HIL strategy on a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) platform as well as a HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX) system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed HIL strategy is able to handle the varying interaction dynamics with less interaction force between the pilot and the exoskeleton when compared to traditional model-based control algorithms."

A robust and reliable algorithm could have great impact on problems in learning control. Recent work on combining the worlds of computationally efficient and locally adaptive learning algorithms with robust learning frameworks such as Gaussian process regression has taken a step towards both robust and real-time capable learning systems. However, online learning of model parameters on streaming data - that is strongly correlated, such as data arriving along a trajectory - can still create serious issues for many learning systems. Here we investigate the idea of drifting Gaussian processes which explicitly exploit the fact that data is generated along trajectories. A drifting Gaussian process keeps a history of a constant number of recently observed data points and updates its hyper-parameters at each time step. Instead of optimizing the neighborhood size on which the GP is trained on, we propose to use several - in parallel - drifting GPs whose predictions are combined for query points. We illustrate our approach on synthetically generated data and successfully evaluate on inverse dynamics learning tasks."

With this framework, an initial set of controller gains is automatically improved according to a pre-defined performance objective evaluated from experimental data. The underlying Bayesian optimization algorithm is Entropy Search, which represents the latent objective as a Gaussian process and constructs an explicit belief over the location of the objective minimum. This is used to maximize the information gain from each experimental evaluation. Thus, this framework shall yield improved controllers with fewer evaluations compared to alternative approaches. A seven-degree-of-freedom robot arm balancing an inverted pole is used as the experimental demonstrator. Results of two- and four-dimensional tuning problems highlight the method's potential for automatic controller tuning on robotic platforms."

To tackle this challenge, two main problems can be identified: i) creating on-line maps of the relevant variables, based on sparse local measurements; ii) designing a planning algorithm which exploits the obtained map to generate trajectories that optimize the adaptive data sampling process, minimizing the uncertainty in the map, while steering the vehicles within the air flows to generate energetic-efficient flights. Our approach is based on Gaussian Processes (GP) for the mapping, combined with a stochastic optimization scheme for the trajectories generation. The system is tested in simulations carried out using a realistic three-dimensional current field. Results for a single UAV as well as for a fleet of multiple UAVs, sharing information to cooperatively achieve the mission, are provided."

As more robots are used in these scenarios, it becomes viable to collaborate between heterogeneous types of robots to leverage their individual strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. More specifically, in a scenario involving unmanned ground and aerial vehicles (UGV, UAV), the ground robot can contribute its high payload capacity to provide computational resources and high accuracy sensors while the aerial robot can bring its high mobility and capability to traverse obstacles to the team. However, in order for the team to benefit from these capabilities, it must be capable of generating a plan for both robots that allows them to collaboratively localize when necessary. Our approach to this problem is to combine a recently developed state lattice planner using controller-based motion primitives (SLC) with planning using adaptive dimensionality (PAD). The SLC planner allows for robust navigation using a wide variety of sensors including in areas with no or limited high-quality localization information while the PAD planner allows us to expand beyond a single robot and generate plans for a team of robots operating in a high dimensional space. We present our results to this combined approach for a UGV/UAV team operating indoors in areas with limited visual features."

In addition to generating collision-free trajectories for each agent, our approach is able to simulate macroscopic group movements and proxemic behaviors that result in coherent navigation. Our approach is general, makes no assumptions about the size or shape of the group, and can generate smooth trajectories for the agents. Furthermore, it can dynamically adapt to obstacles or the behavior of other agents. The additional overhead of generating proxemic group behaviors is relatively small and our approach can simulate hundreds of agents in real-time. We highlight its benefits on different benchmarks."

Each robot or agent is represented using a tight-fitting 2D ellipse in the plane. We extend the reciprocal velocity obstacle formulation by using conservative linear approximations of ellipses and derive sufficient conditions for collision-free motion based on low-dimensional linear programming. We use precomputed Minkowski Sum approximations for real-time and conservative collision avoidance in large multi-agent environments. Finally, we present efficient techniques to update the orientation to compute collision-free trajectories. Our algorithm can handle thousands of elliptical agents in real-time on a single core and provides significant speedups over prior algorithms for elliptical agents. We compare the runtime performance and behavior with circular agents on different benchmarks."

The formations are flexible in the sense that their formation configurations are defined based on curvilinear longitudinal and lateral relative separations instead of the commonly used rectilinear relative separations. And the mobile robots' motions considered here are kinodynamically constrained. In this work, we relate the formation maneuverability with the mobile robots' limited motion capabilities and the formation's configuration which in turn provides a measure on the formation's motion capabilities. In addition, useful findings pertaining to fundamental formations are also derived, which are advantageous for efficient and effective formation motion planning and control. These results lay a foundation to address the problems of planning kinodynamically feasible formation leader's trajectories to connect flexible formations between different locations such that every robot of the formation can follow its assigned formation point without violating it's kinodynamical motion constraints."

The proposed technique consists of a planning layer where a model predictive control is utilized to obtain a virtual input for manipulation of cells, and a control layer where the desired inputs for laser beams and motorized stage are obtained by means of the control allocation technique. Unlike existing methods on simultaneous manipulation of laser and motorized stage which the desired inputs for lasers and stage are given separately, here, the planning and control layers are integrated together to obtain optimal inputs for both laser and motorized stage.

Paschalidis,Mac Schwager,","We investigate the cooperative pursuit of an evader by a group of quadrotors in an environment with no-fly zones. While the pursuers cannot enter into no-fly zones, the evader may freely move through zones to avoid capture. Once the evader enters a no-fly zone, the pursuers calculate a reachable set of evader positions. Using tools from Voronoi-based coverage control applied to the evader's reachable set, we provide an algorithm that distributes the pursuers around the zone's boundary and minimizes the capture time once the evader leaves the no-fly zone. Robust model predictive control (RMPC) tools are used to control the quadrotors and to ensure that they always remain in free space. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms through a series of experiments on KMEL Nano+ quadrotors."

Risk averse policies are needed when large deviations from the expected behavior may have detrimental effects, and conventional MDP algorithms usually ignore this aspect. We provide conditions for the structure of the underlying MDP ensuring that approximations for the exact problem can be derived and solved efficiently. Our findings are novel inasmuch as average value at risk has not previously been considered in association with the total cost criterion. Our method is demonstrated in a rapid deployment scenario, whereby a robot is tasked with the objective of reaching a target location within a temporal deadline where increased speed is associated with increased probability of failure. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only produces a risk averse policy reducing the probability of exceeding the expected temporal deadline, but also provides the statistical distribution of costs, thus offering a valuable analysis tool."

Each robot has its own unique, bounded yet controllable sensing range which can be adjusted. The state of those robots within the sensing range can be estimated, which induces the directed network topology of the multi-robot systems. In particular, we consider multi-robot systems containing faulty robots which can behave arbitrarily. Our recent work [1] has addressed the problem of achieving rendezvous in the presence of faulty robots under a restrictive class of conditions on network topology. In this work, we presented a theoretically correct, but computationally intractable algorithm. We extend our past work by proposing a new approximate algorithm that is computationally efficient, and by showing that the proposed algorithm solves our problem given faulty robots in general configurations under mild assumptions on the network topology. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is to provide an efficient computational framework and analysis of robust rendezvous algorithm in the presence of faulty robots. Several simulation results are provided to demonstrate that our algorithm performs well in the face of both stationary and dynamic faults."

A fractional-order differential equation can contain derivative terms with non-integer order, e.g., the one-half derivative. This paper demonstrates that the fractional order of the dynamics of a system may be a potentially powerful new way to monitor the operational status of such systems. When the order of the system changes, it can indicate an important change in the status of the system. Integer-order models will never exhibit a change in order because the order is dictated by a natural first principle and the structure of the system. For this reason, traditional health monitoring tools essentially focus on identifying parameter variations in a mathematical description of the system, but not changes in order. When fractional-order models are considered, the infinite number of possible real-valued orders between any two integer orders may capture essential changes in the system's dynamics. This paper provides an example of such changes, provides a theoretical justification for the approach, and explores possible limitations to the approach."

The set of generalized friction loads is the 1-sublevel set of a polynomial whose gradient directions correspond to generalized velocities. Additionally, the polynomial is confined to be convex even-degree homogeneous in order to obey the maximum work inequality, symmetry, shape invariance in scale, and fast invertibility.

The method combines iteratively refitted time-varying linear models with trajectory optimization, and can be seen as an instance of model-based reinforcement learning or as adaptive optimal control. Its appeal lies in the ability to handle challenging problems with surprisingly little data. We show that we can achieve sample-efficient learning of tasks that involve intermittent contact dynamics and under-actuation. Furthermore, we can control the hand directly at the level of the pneumatic valves, without the use of a prior model that describes the relationship between valve commands and joint torques. We compare results from learning in simulation and on the physical system. Even though the learned policies are local, they are able to control the system in the face of substantial variability in initial state."

Dollar,","While designing robot hands based on grasping data is more common, fewer previous works have used details of human manipulation kinematics to improve robot hand design. The current work involves an underactuated, tendon driven, anthropomorphic manipulator with two flexor tendons and an abduction-adduction tendon, and describes its design based on experimental human precision manipulation data. Link lengths, joint axis alignment, and moment arms were derived from human subject data and values in the literature. The spring ratios, determining the torque relationships between joints, were then selected to maximize the achievable manipulation workspace from the human trial without requiring large forces, which are likely to lead to instability and object ejection. This is done by minimizing the stored spring energy in the robotic fingers across the range of precision manipulation workspace positions achieved by a representative human subject. After fabricating the hand, the energy characteristics of the resulting prototype are analyzed, and the robotic workspace is compared against the original human one. Despite only having three actuators, the hand is able to manipulate the test object within a 2.7 cm 3 workspace volume, compared to an average human workspace of 5.4 cm 3 for the same object. Future work could include adding antagonist actuators to achieve a larger motion range along the palmar-dorsal axis, which is currently the most limited axis of motion in comparison to the original human workspace."

Current dexterous micro-handling solutions are often limited to small amplitude rotations (around 90°) and to simple shaped objects (such as squares). Our approach consists in developing in-hand micro-manipulation techniques using dexterous micro-hands, taking advantage of adhesion forces, to manipulate arbitrary shaped objects. This paper focuses on the trajectory generation of a dexterous micro-hand to achieve automated repositioning. The statistical results on the generated trajectories show that the adhesion forces in micro-scale can be exploited to enhance micro-manipulation."

We perform pivoting by means of gravity, allowing the object to rotate between the fingers of a one degree of freedom gripper and controlling the gripping force to ensure that the object follows a reference trajectory and arrives at the desired angular position. We use a visual pose estimation system to track the pose of the object and force measurements from tactile sensors to control the gripping force. The adaptive controller employs an update law that accommodates for errors in the friction coefficient, which is one of the most common sources of uncertainty in manipulation. Our experiments confirm that the proposed adaptive controller successfully pivots a grasped object in the presence of uncertainty in the object's friction parameters."
icra,None,Multimodal execution monitoring for anomaly detection during robot manipulation,"Daehyung Park,Zackory Erickson,Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee,Charles C. Kemp,","Online detection of anomalous execution can be valuable for robot manipulation, enabling robots to operate more safely, determine when a behavior is inappropriate, and otherwise exhibit more common sense. By using multiple complementary sensory modalities, robots could potentially detect a wider variety of anomalies, such as anomalous contact or a loud utterance by a human. However, task variability and the potential for false positives make online anomaly detection challenging, especially for long-duration manipulation behaviors. In this paper, we provide evidence for the value of multimodal execution monitoring and the use of a detection threshold that varies based on the progress of execution. Using a data-driven approach, we train an execution monitor that runs in parallel to a manipulation behavior. Like previous methods for anomaly detection, our method trains a hidden Markov model (HMM) using multimodal observations from non-anomalous executions. In contrast to prior work, our system also uses a detection threshold that changes based on the execution progress. We evaluated our approach with haptic, visual, auditory, and kinematic sensing during a variety of manipulation tasks performed by a PR2 robot. The tasks included pushing doors closed, operating switches, and assisting able-bodied participants with eating yogurt. In our evaluations, our anomaly detection method performed substantially better with multimodal monitoring than single modality monitoring. It also resulted in more desirable ROC curves when compared with other detection threshold methods from the literature, obtaining higher true positive rates for comparable false positive rates."

In order to deal with the peg-in-hole insertion problem without any need of an external force/torque sensor, this paper proposes to actively accomplish compliance in the insertion task relying on an admittance based control. This is combined with a real-time trajectory generator, by means of constraint based optimization, where a model-based sensorless observer of interaction forces is exploited. Experiments have been performed on an ABB dual-arm 7-DOF lightweight prototype robot to validate the proposed approach, with an insertion speed comparable to human manual execution and in presence of geometric uncertainty."

The main difficulties arise in the precise localization of the parts in an unstructured environment and the control of contact interactions. Our contribution in this paper is twofold. First, we propose a taxonomy of the manipulation primitives that are specifically involved in fine assembly. Such a taxonomy is crucial for designing a scalable robotic system (both hardware and software) given the complexity of real-world assembly tasks. Second, we present a hardware and software architecture where we have addressed, in an integrated way, a number of issues arising in fine assembly, such as workspace optimization, external wrench compensation, position-based force control, etc. Finally, we show the above taxonomy and architecture in action on a highly dexterous task - bimanual pin insertion - which is one of the key steps in our long term project, the autonomous assembly of a ready-to-assemble chair."
icra,None,Kinematic multi-robot manipulation with no communication using force feedback,"Zijian Wang,Mac Schwager,","This paper proposes a novel decentralized algorithm that coordinates the forces of a group of robots during a cooperative manipulation task. The highlight of our approach is that no communication is needed between any two robots. Our underlying intuition is that every follower robot can measure the direction of the movement of the object and then applies its force along that direction to reinforce the movement. We prove that using our algorithm, all followers' forces will synchronize to the direction of the force applied by one leader robot, who guides the robotic fleet to its destination. We first verify our algorithm by simulation in a physics engine, where 20 robots transport a chair collectively. We then validate our algorithm in hardware experiments by building four low-cost robots, equipped with force and velocity sensors, to transport a cardboard box in a laboratory environment. In addition, our algorithm allows the leader to be a human, and we also demonstrate the human-swarm cooperation in our manipulation experiments."

We propose two different novel solutions. The first is a controller which ensures exact tracking of the load twist. This controller is partially decentralized since, locally, it does not rely on the state of all the robots but needs only to know the system parameters and load twist. Then we propose a fully decentralized controller that differs from the first one for the use of i) a decentralized estimation of the parameters and twist of the load based only on local measurements of the velocity of the contact points and ii) a discontinuous robustification term in the control law. The second controller ensures a practical stabilization of the twist in presence of estimation errors. The theoretical results are finally corroborated with a simulation campaign evaluating different manipulation settings."

Such tasks require reasoning about complex goals as well as the feasibility of movements in configuration space. In discrete representations, planning complexity is exponential in the length of the plan. In mobile manipulation, parameters for an action often draw from a continuous space, so we must also cope with an infinite branching factor. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods integrate logical search over high-level actions with geometric reasoning to address this challenge. We present an algorithm that searches the space of possible task and motion plans and uses statistical machine learning to guide the search process. Our contributions are as follows: 1) we present a complete algorithm for TAMP; 2) we present a randomized local search algorithm for plan refinement that is easily formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP); 3) we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a policy for this MDP; 4) we learn from expert demonstrations to efficiently search the space of high-level task plans, given options that address different (potential) infeasibilities; and 5) we run experiments to evaluate our system in a variety of simulated domains.

In this paper we aim to change that, and draw inspiration from the 3D design community to propose a teleoperation interface control mode that is identical to the ones being used to locally navigate the virtual viewpoint of most Computer Aided Design (CAD) softwares. The proposed mobile manipulator control framework thus allows the user to focus on the 3D objects being manipulated, using control modes such as orbit object and pan object, supported by data from the wrist mounted RGB-D sensor. The gripper of the robot performs the desired motions relative to the object, while the manipulator arm and base moves in a way that realizes the desired gripper motions.

However they impose a burden on supervisors to respond to queries each time the robot encounters new states while executing its current best policy. The MMD-IL algorithm reduces supervisor burden by filtering queries with insufficient discrepancy in distribution and maintaining multiple policies. We introduce the SHIV algorithm (Svm-based reduction in Human InterVention), which converges to a single policy and reduces supervisor burden in non-stationary high dimensional state distributions. To facilitate scaling and outlier rejection, filtering is based on a measure of risk defined in terms of distance to an approximate level set boundary defined by a One Class support vector machine. We report on experiments in three contexts: 1) a driving simulator with a 27,936 dimensional visual feature space, 2) a push-grasping in clutter simulation with a 22 dimensional state space, and 3) physical surgical needle insertion with a 16 dimensional state space.

One solution has been proposed to automatically learn near optimal motions with Reinforcement Learning (RL). This has been successful for several tasks including swing-free UAV flight, table tennis, and autonomous driving. However, high-dimensional problems remain a challenge. We address this dimensionality constraint with PrEference Appraisal Reinforcement Learning (PEARL), which solves tasks with opposing preferences for acceleration controlled robots. PEARL projects the high-dimensional continuous robot state space to a low dimensional preference feature space resulting in efficient and adaptable planning. We demonstrate that on a dynamic obstacle avoidance robotic task, a single learning on a much simpler problem performs real-time decision-making for significantly larger, high-dimensional problems working in unbounded continuous states and actions. We trained the agent with 4 static obstacles, while the trained agent avoids up to 900 moving obstacles with complex hybrid stochastic obstacle dynamics in a highly constrained space using only limited information about the environment. We compare these tasks to traditional, often manually tuned solutions for these high-dimensional problems."
icra,None,Safe controller optimization for quadrotors with Gaussian processes,"Felix Berkenkamp,Angela P. Schoellig,Andreas Krause,","One of the most fundamental problems when designing controllers for dynamic systems is the tuning of the controller parameters. Typically, a model of the system is used to obtain an initial controller, but ultimately the controller parameters must be tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best performance. To avoid this manual tuning step, methods from machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, have been used. However, as these methods evaluate different controller parameters on the real system, safety-critical system failures may happen. In this paper, we overcome this problem by applying, for the first time, a recently developed safe optimization algorithm, SafeOpt, to the problem of automatic controller parameter tuning. Given an initial, low-performance controller, SafeOpt automatically optimizes the parameters of a control law while guaranteeing safety. It models the underlying performance measure as a Gaussian process and only explores new controller parameters whose performance lies above a safe performance threshold with high probability. Experimental results on a quadrotor vehicle indicate that the proposed method enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of controller parameters without human intervention."

Typically, demonstration data do not contain the control inputs required to reproduce the demonstrated skill. These can be obtained from a low-level controller that tracks the modeled movement. We present a PbD approach for minimal intervention control - a control strategy that only corrects perturbations that interfere with task performance. The novelty of our approach is the probabilistic encoding of the movement duration, providing a performance measure that enables minimal intervention control in a temporal sense. This is achieved by combining a probabilistic movement encoding based on Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) with Model Predictive Control (MPC). The probabilistic model is used to construct an objective function, hereby assuming that variance is a measure for task performance. The proposed method is demonstrated in a robot experiment and compared with our earlier work."

Model predictive control is then used to choose the actions under an optimistic model of the dynamics, which produces an efficient and goal-directed exploration strategy. We present real time experimental results on standard benchmark problems involving the pendulum, cartpole, and double pendulum systems.

However, applying reinforcement learning requires a sufficiently detailed representation of the state, including the configuration of task-relevant objects. We present an approach that automates state-space construction by learning a state representation directly from camera images. Our method uses a deep spatial autoencoder to acquire a set of feature points that describe the environment for the current task, such as the positions of objects, and then learns a motion skill with these feature points using an efficient reinforcement learning method based on local linear models. The resulting controller reacts continuously to the learned feature points, allowing the robot to dynamically manipulate objects in the world with closed-loop control. We demonstrate our method with a PR2 robot on tasks that include pushing a free-standing toy block, picking up a bag of rice using a spatula, and hanging a loop of rope on a hook at various positions. In each task, our method automatically learns to track task-relevant objects and manipulate their configuration with the robot's arm."
icra,None,Learning deep neural network policies with continuous memory states,"Marvin Zhang,Zoe McCarthy,Chelsea Finn,Sergey Levine,Pieter Abbeel,","Policy learning for partially observed control tasks requires policies that can remember salient information from past observations. In this paper, we present a method for learning policies with internal memory for high-dimensional, continuous systems, such as robotic manipulators. Our approach consists of augmenting the state and action space of the system with continuous-valued memory states that the policy can read from and write to. Learning general-purpose policies with this type of memory representation directly is difficult, because the policy must automatically figure out the most salient information to memorize at each time step. We show that, by decomposing this policy search problem into a trajectory optimization phase and a supervised learning phase through a method called guided policy search, we can acquire policies with effective memorization and recall strategies. Intuitively, the trajectory optimization phase chooses the values of the memory states that will make it easier for the policy to produce the right action in future states, while the supervised learning phase encourages the policy to use memorization actions to produce those memory states. We evaluate our method on tasks involving continuous control in manipulation and navigation settings, and show that our method can learn complex policies that successfully complete a range of tasks that require memory."
icra,None,Learning deep control policies for autonomous aerial vehicles with MPC-guided policy search,"Tianhao Zhang,Gregory Kahn,Sergey Levine,Pieter Abbeel,","Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective method for controlling robotic systems, particularly autonomous aerial vehicles such as quadcopters. However, application of MPC can be computationally demanding, and typically requires estimating the state of the system, which can be challenging in complex, unstructured environments. Reinforcement learning can in principle forego the need for explicit state estimation and acquire a policy that directly maps sensor readings to actions, but is difficult to apply to unstable systems that are liable to fail catastrophically during training before an effective policy has been found. We propose to combine MPC with reinforcement learning in the framework of guided policy search, where MPC is used to generate data at training time, under full state observations provided by an instrumented training environment. This data is used to train a deep neural network policy, which is allowed to access only the raw observations from the vehicle's onboard sensors. After training, the neural network policy can successfully control the robot without knowledge of the full state, and at a fraction of the computational cost of MPC. We evaluate our method by learning obstacle avoidance policies for a simulated quadrotor, using simulated onboard sensors and no explicit state estimation at test time."
icra,None,Deep learning for tactile understanding from visual and haptic data,"Yang Gao,Lisa Anne Hendricks,Katherine J. Kuchenbecker,Trevor Darrell,","Robots which interact with the physical world will benefit from a fine-grained tactile understanding of objects and surfaces. Additionally, for certain tasks, robots may need to know the haptic properties of an object before touching it. To enable better tactile understanding for robots, we propose a method of classifying surfaces with haptic adjectives (e.g., compressible or smooth) from both visual and physical interaction data. Humans typically combine visual predictions and feedback from physical interactions to accurately predict haptic properties and interact with the world. Inspired by this cognitive pattern, we propose and explore a purely visual haptic prediction model. Purely visual models enable a robot to “feel” without physical interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using both visual and physical interaction signals together yields more accurate haptic classification. Our models take advantage of recent advances in deep neural networks by employing a unified approach to learning features for physical interaction and visual observations. Even though we employ little domain specific knowledge, our model still achieves better results than methods based on hand-designed features."

In particular, we consider the mixture of two approaches: Parametric modeling based on rigid body dynamics equations and nonparametric modeling based on incremental kernel methods, with no prior information on the mechanical properties of the system. The result is an incremental semiparametric approach, leveraging the advantages of both the parametric and nonparametric models. We validate the proposed technique learning the dynamics of one arm of the iCub humanoid robot."

icra,None,Robust tracking of unknown objects through adaptive size estimation and appearance learning,"Alessandro Pieropan,Niklas Bergström,Masatoshi Ishikawa,Danica Kragic,,","This work employs an adaptive learning mechanism to perform tracking of an unknown object through RGBD cameras. We extend our previous framework to robustly track a wider range of arbitrarily shaped objects by adapting the model to the measured object size. The size is estimated as the object undergoes motion, which is done by fitting an inscribed cuboid to the measurements. The region spanned by this cuboid is used during tracking, to determine whether or not new measurements should be added to the object model. In our experiments we test our tracker with a set of objects of arbitrary shape and we show the benefit of the proposed model due to its ability to adapt to the object shape which leads to more robust tracking results."
icra,None,Global data association for the Probability Hypothesis Density filter using network flows,"Nicolai Wojke,Dietrich Paulus,","The Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter is an efficient formulation of multi-target state estimation that circumvents the combinatorial explosion of the multi-target posterior by operating on single-target space without maintaining target identities. In this paper, we propose a multi-target tracker based on the PHD filter that provides instantaneous state estimation and delayed decision on data association. For this purpose, we reformulate the PHD recursion in terms of single-target track hypotheses and solve a min-cost flow network for trajectory estimation where measurement likelihoods and transition probabilities are based on multi-target state estimates. In this manner, the presented approach combines global data association with efficient multi-target filtering. We evaluate the approach on a publicly available pedestrian tracking dataset to present state estimation and data association capabilities."
icra,None,Robust camera motion estimation using direct edge alignment and sub-gradient method,"Manohar Kuse,Shaojie Shen,","There has been a paradigm shifting trend towards feature-less methods due to their elegant formulation, accuracy and ever increasing computational power. In this work, we present a direct edge alignment approach for 6-DOF tracking. We argue that photo-consistency based methods are plagued by a much smaller convergence basin and are extremely sensitive to noise, changing illumination and fast motion. We propose to use the Distance Transform in the energy formulation which can significantly extend the influence of the edges for tracking. We address the problem of non-differentiability of our cost function and of the previous methods by use of a sub-gradient method. Through extensive experiments we show that the proposed method gives comparable performance to the previous method under nominal conditions and is able to run at 30 Hz in single threaded mode. In addition, under large motion we demonstrate our method outperforms previous methods using the same runtime configuration for our method."
icra,None,Monocular 3D tracking of deformable surfaces,"Luis Puig,Kostas Daniilidis,","The problem of reconstructing deformable 3D surfaces has been studied in the non-rigid structure from motion context, where either tracked points over long sequences or an initial 3D shape are required, and also with piecewise methods, where the deformable surface is modeled as a triangulated mesh, which is fitted to an initial estimation of the 3D surface computed from correspondences in two views. In this paper we present a new scheme to reconstruct deformable surfaces by tracking relevant features that parametrize such deformation. Assuming that an initial 3D shape related to a reference frame is available, we initially match the reference and current frames using visual information. Then, these correspondences are clustered in patches with geometric characteristics in the image domain and 3D space. In order to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated, we explain each cluster using thin-plate splines (TPS) with a minimal number of control points. Then the 3D coordinates of these control points in the deformed surface are estimated using a non-linear least squares approach, deriving on the reconstruction of the full deformed patches. We perform experiments in synthetic and real data of monocular video sequences to validate our approach."

We derive the equations of a Riemannian Extended Kalman Filter to perform the structure estimation from an image sequence captured by a perspective camera. In order to theoretically validate our approach, we prove that the proposed model is locally weakly observable. Finally, we report quantitative results on both synthetic data and on real sequences from the CMU Mocap dataset."
icra,None,Depth-based object tracking using a Robust Gaussian Filter,"Jan Issac,Manuel Wüthrich,Cristina Garcia Cifuentes,Jeannette Bohg,,,","We consider the problem of model-based 3D-tracking of objects given dense depth images as input. Two difficulties preclude the application of a standard Gaussian filter to this problem. First of all, depth sensors are characterized by fat-tailed measurement noise. To address this issue, we show how a recently published robustification method for Gaussian filters can be applied to the problem at hand. Thereby, we avoid using heuristic outlier detection methods that simply reject measurements if they do not match the model. Secondly, the computational cost of the standard Gaussian filter is prohibitive due to the high-dimensional measurement, i.e. the depth image. To address this problem, we propose an approximation to reduce the computational complexity of the filter. In quantitative experiments on real data we show how our method clearly outperforms the standard Gaussian filter. Furthermore, we compare its performance to a particle-filter-based tracking method, and observe comparable computational efficiency and improved accuracy and smoothness of the estimates."
icra,None,Robot arm pose estimation by pixel-wise regression of joint angles,"Felix Widmaier,Daniel Kappler,Stefan Schaal,Jeannette Bohg,","To achieve accurate vision-based control with a robotic arm, a good hand-eye coordination is required. However, knowing the current configuration of the arm can be very difficult due to noisy readings from joint encoders or an inaccurate hand-eye calibration. We propose an approach for robot arm pose estimation that uses depth images of the arm as input to directly estimate angular joint positions. This is a frame-by-frame method which does not rely on good initialisation of the solution from the previous frames or knowledge from the joint encoders. For estimation, we employ a random regression forest which is trained on synthetically generated data. We compare different training objectives of the forest and also analyse the influence of prior segmentation of the arms on accuracy. We show that this approach improves previous work both in terms of computational complexity and accuracy. Despite being trained on synthetic data only, we demonstrate that the estimation also works on real depth images."

Saccade Mirror 3 is based on three automated rotational mirrors, and this gaze control mechanism can achieve an ultrawide gaze control range of 360 deg in theory. A prototype was developed based on this mechanism. A gaze control range of over 260 degrees in the pan direction and a high-speed response of about 10 ms were confirmed. Furthermore, the prototype was applied to high-speed visual tracking coupled with a 1000 fps high-speed vision system. A visual tracking algorithm was developed for this mechanism, and high-speed tracking of a table tennis ball in play and a flying drone was successfully demonstrated."

This tensegrity elbow actuates by shortening and lengthening cables in a method inspired by muscular actuation in a person. Unlike many series elastic actuators, this joint is structurally compliant not just along each axis of rotation, but along other axes as well. Compliant robotic joints are indispensable in unpredictable environments, including ones where the robot must interface with a person. The joint also addresses the need for functional redundancy and flexibility, traits which are required for many applications that investigate the use of biologically accurate robotic models."

For all these devices, one would wish to develop actuators enabling wide range impedance modulation with low energy cost. Using conventional and biologically-inspired compliant actuation, previous research led to functional devices but with high energy cost. Here we introduce a minimalistic compliant actuator to realize impedance modulation with low energy cost. Using this actuator we demonstrate stiffness augmentation in human-machine collaboration. We argue that the non-biologically-inspired actuation concept presented here may effectively complement a biological system, by restoring or extending its functionality, with negligible energy cost."

Tsagarakis,","The general approach to humanoid feet design considers the use of rectangular plate sole structures that are relatively stiff and compatible for flat terrain locomotion. Although this can be adequate the inability of these stiff feet to cope with small terrain irregularities, it makes them inappropriate for rough terrains. Toward improvement of humanoids feet this paper presents mechanism of new variable compliant humanoid feet which can provide functionality and adaptability to humanoids locomotion on uneven terrains. The proposed feet design introduces new toe mechanism in the feet with variable stiffness implemented using a leaf spring and rubber balls in series.

icra,None,Work density analysis of adjustable stiffness mechanisms,"Marius Stücheli,André Foehr,Mirko Meboldt,","Mechanical compliance is important for a robust and safe physical interaction of robots with humans and unstructured environments. Using adjustable stiffness, the advantages of compliant and stiff systems can be combined and thus the versatility of a robot increased. The realisation of adjustable stiffness in robot joints through compliant mechanisms shows several advantages over active control approaches, especially in terms of robustness. The compactness of adjustable stiffness mechanisms (ASMs) is important for their integration in robotic systems. An important aspect of compactness in ASMs is the storable work per volume, i.e. the work density. Therefore we propose a set of benchmarks to analyse the work density of elastic mechanisms on different design levels. The application of these benchmarks is demonstrated on a novel ASM, which is part of the adjustable impedance element AIE Uno, and on DLR's FSJ. The analysis of these ASMs demonstrates the application and the benefit of the proposed benchmarks. The benchmarks support the choice between alternative solutions and the identification of improvement potential in an existing design."
icra,None,Design of a hopping mechanism using a voice coil actuator: Linear elastic actuator in parallel (LEAP),"Zachary Batts,Joohyung Kim,Katsu Yamane,","Among legged robots, hopping and running robots are useful because they can traverse terrain at high speeds and are a benchmark platform for locomotion actuators; if an actuator can power a hopping robot, it can power a walking robot. We aim to create a hopping mechanism for a small-scale, one-legged, untethered hopping robot. A parallel-elastic actuator is an efficient way to do this, and enables the actuator to directly inject energy into the spring, but requires a high-speed, low-inertia actuator. Voice coil actuators are electrically-powered direct-drive translational motors that have very low moving inertia, low friction, can produce force at high speeds, and have a linear force output. These qualities make them ideal candidate motors for a linear elastic actuator in parallel (“LEAP”). Here, we derive an electromechanical model of the LEAP mechanism, develop a simple bang-bang hopping controller, and simulate hopping with a range of spring parameters to find an optimal spring stiffness that maximizes hopping height. We detail our implemented design, and characterize its performance through a series of experiments. We test our robot with different spring stiffnesses, and demonstrate hopping at a maximum steady-state of 3.5 cm ground-clearance (approx. 20% leg length). Our results suggest that the LEAP mechanism may serve the weight-bearing functions of a robot leg."

It is based on the use of prestressed cable-driven mechanisms in singular configurations to provide large stiffness variation ranges, including zero stiffness configuration as required by the medical context. An original implementation is proposed, with a prestress adjustment system using pneumatic energy and taking advantage of multimaterial additive manufacturing. The proposed component combines compactness, MR-compatibility and is lightweight. The system is evaluated on a dedicated experimental setup with validation of the expected behavior, with in particular a very large achievable range of stiffnesses. The approach is effective for the design of such device and constitutes a novel solution for the design of variable stiffness devices with complex motions."

Many of these solutions are, however, tailored for a specific application and a general schematic that allows for drastic energy reduction remains a challenge. We have developed a series-parallel elastic actuator (SPEA) based on a symbiosis of multiple motors, springs and locking mechanisms in parallel, which we call +SPEA. This paper introduces the novel +SPEA concept. We present a first prototype, a +SPEA model and a control strategy that optimizes the energy consumption, and experiments to verify the working principle and recruitment strategy. The experiments show a good fit with the model and currently the actuator reduces the required energy in blocked output experiments by more than a factor 4."
icra,None,"A lightweight, low-power electroadhesive clutch and spring for exoskeleton actuation","Stuart Diller,Carmel Majidi,Steven H. Collins,","Clutches can be used to enhance the functionality of springs or actuators in robotic devices. Here we describe a lightweight, low-power clutch used to control spring engagement in an ankle exoskeleton. The clutch is based on electrostatic adhesion between thin electrode sheets coated with a dielectric material. Each electrode pair weighs 1.5 g, bears up to 100 N, and changes states in less than 30 ms. We placed clutches in series with elastomer springs to allow control of spring engagement, and placed several clutched springs in parallel to discretely adjust stiffness. By engaging different numbers of springs, the system produced six different levels of stiffness. Force at peak displacement ranged from 14 to 501 N, and the device returned 95% of stored mechanical energy. Each clutched spring element weighed 26 g. We attached one clutched spring to an ankle exoskeleton and used it to engage the spring only while the foot was on the ground during 150 consecutive walking steps. Peak torque was 7.3 N·m on an average step, and the device consumed 0.6 mW of electricity. Compared to other electrically-controllable clutches, this approach results in three times higher torque density and two orders of magnitude lower power consumption per unit torque. We anticipate this technology will be incorporated into exoskeletons that tune stiffness online and into new actuator designs that utilize many lightweight, low-power clutches acting in concert."
icra,None,A hybrid hydrostatic transmission and human-safe haptic telepresence robot,"John P. Whitney,Tianyao Chen,John Mars,Jessica K. Hodgins,","We present a new type of hydrostatic transmission that uses a hybrid air-water configuration, analogous to N+1 cable-tendon transmissions, using N hydraulic lines and 1 pneumatic line for a system with N degrees of freedom (DOFs). The common air-filled line preloads all DOFs in the system, allowing bidirectional operation of every joint. This configuration achieves the high stiffness of a water-filled transmission with half the number of bulky hydraulic lines. We implemented this transmission using pairs of rolling-diaphragm cylinders to form rotary hydraulic actuators, with a new design achieving a 600-percent increase in specific work density per cycle. These actuators were used to build a humanoid robot with two 4-DOF arms, connected via the hydrostatic transmission to an identical master. Stereo cameras mounted on a 2-DOF servo-controlled neck stream live video to the operator's head-mounted display, which in turn sends the real-time attitude of the operator's head to the neck servos in the robot. The operator is visually immersed in the robot's physical workspace, and through the bilateral coupling of the low-impedance hydrostatic transmission, directly feels interaction forces between the robot and external environment. We qualitatively assessed the performance of this system for remote object manipulation and use as a platform to safely study physical human-robot interaction."

Dogramadzi,","Robotic assistance can bring significant improvements to orthopedic fracture surgery: facilitate more accurate fracture fragment repositioning without open access and obviate problems related to the current minimally invasive fracture surgery techniques by providing a better clinical outcome, reduced recovery time, and health-related costs. This paper presents a new design of the robot-assisted fracture surgery (RAFS) system developed at Bristol Robotics Laboratory, featuring a new robotic architecture, and real-time 3D imaging of the fractured anatomy. The technology presented in this paper focuses on distal femur fractures, but can be adapted to the larger domain of fracture surgeries, improving the state-of-the-art in robot assistance in orthopedics. To demonstrate the enhanced performance of the RAFS system, 10 reductions of a distal femur fracture are performed using the system on a bone model. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and safety of the new RAFS system. The system allows the surgeon to precisely reduce the fractures with a reduction accuracy of 1.15 mm and 1.3°, meeting the clinical requirements for this procedure."

This paper explores the requirements and utility of a new type of depth sensor, the plenoptic camera, for surgical robots. We present a metric calibration procedure for the plenoptic camera and the registration of its coordinate frame to the robot (hand-eye calibration). We also demonstrate the utility in robotic needle insertion and application of sutures in phantoms. The metric calibration accuracy is reported as 1.14 ± 0.80 mm for the plenoptic camera and 1.57 ± 0.90 mm for hand-eye calibration. The accuracy of needle insertion task is 1.79 ± 0.35 mm for the entire robotic system. Additionally, the accuracy of suture placement with the presented system is reported at 1.80 ± 0.43 mm. Finally, we report consistent suture spacing with only 0.11 mm standard deviation between inter-suture distances. The measured accuracy of less than 2 mm with consistent suture spacing is a promising result to provide repeatable leak-free suturing with a robotic tool and a plenoptic depth imager."

One of the latest advances is the introduction of human-robot cooperative control combining features such as active constraints, machine learning and automated movements. This paper aims to integrate these techniques into a framework which can be generalized to a wide range of surgical tasks. This paper proposes a system entitled Hubot; a Human-Robot collaborative framework which combines the strengths of the surgeon, the advantages of robotics and learning from demonstration into a single system. Hubot was successfully implemented on a Raven II surgical robot and a user study was conducted to evaluate its performance. Both a training and a simulated clinical case were investigated and showed promising results in comparison to fully manual task execution, including reduced completion time, fewer movements for the operator and improved efficiency."
icra,None,Toward human-robot collaboration in surgery: Performance assessment of human and robotic agents in an inclusion segmentation task,"Kirsten E. Kaplan,Kirk A. Nichols,Allison M. Okamura,","Increasing the level of autonomy in robot-assisted surgery has the potential to improve the safety, speed, and applicability of robot-assisted surgical systems. To facilitate the development and incorporation of robot autonomy in clinical settings, human-robot collaboration models have been suggested in which human and robotic agents work together to accomplish a task. In this work, we measure performance of several human-robot collaboration models in two experiments based on the task of segmenting a stiff inclusion in soft tissue, which simulates a tumor. In the inclusion segmentation experiment, twelve participants explored an artificial tissue and identified the inclusion boundary under the collaboration models of (1) teleoperation, (2) supervised control, (3) traded control, and (4) full autonomy. In the boundary identification experiment, we isolate the performance of human and robotic agents in the boundary identification sub-task; participants and a robotic agent independently identified the boundary of four virtually palpated tissues. Results from the inclusion segmentation experiment indicate that human agents complete the task faster; teleoperation had the fastest task times. Results of both experiments indicate that the robotic agent identifies boundaries with higher sensitivity and less variance than human agents. This indicates that task accuracy increases when a robotic agent segments the boundary, while including a human agent can decrease the overall task time."

Various techniques for remote control of ultrasound probes through telemanipulation systems have been presented in the past, however not exploiting the potential of fully autonomous acquisitions directly performed by robotic systems. In this paper, a trajectory planning algorithm for automatic robotic ultrasound acquisition under expert supervision is introduced. The objective is to compute a suitable path for covering a volume of interest selected in diagnostic images, for example by prior segmentation. A 3D patient surface point cloud is acquired using a depth camera, which is the sole prerequisite besides the volume delineation. An easily parameterizable path function generates single or multiple parallel scan trajectories capable of dealing with large target volumes. A spline is generated through the preliminary path points and is transferred to a lightweight robot to perform the ultrasound scan using an impedance control mode.

icra,None,Optical-inertial tracking of an input device for real-time robot control,"Florian Steidle,Andreas Tobergte,Alin Albu-Schäffer,","Minimally invasive robotic surgery systems are usually controlled by input devices, that are mechanically linked to the environment. These input devices often have a limited workspace, which makes intuitive operation difficult. This paper presents a tracking algorithm of a handheld input device, which combines inertial and optical measurements to obtain accurate and robust state estimates with high update rates and low latency. It is based on the fusion of inertial and optical data in an error state extended Kalman filter. To achieve a high degree of robustness with respect to partial device occlusions, active optical markers are tracked and their 2D positions in the camera planes are directly forwarded to the fusion process. The algorithm can handle partial occlusions of the device in one or all of the cameras. A quality measure is defined, which indicates if tracking performance is sufficient to control a robot. An exemplary task in a medical robotics context verifies the assumption that the tracking system can be used for real-time robot control despite frequent marker occlusions."

icra,None,Learning binary features online from motion dynamics for incremental loop-closure detection and place recognition,"Guangcong Zhang,Mason J. Lilly,Patricio A. Vela,","This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to learn visual features online for improving loop-closure detection and place recognition, based on bag-of-words frameworks. The approach learns a codeword in the bag-of-words model from a pair of matched features from two consecutive frames, such that the codeword has temporally-derived perspective invariance to camera motion. The learning algorithm is efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the mean image patch, and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by minimizing the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two original features. A codeword is generated by packaging the learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to measure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the learned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis constraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords, which improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental bag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate improved precision/recall outperforming state of the art with little loss in runtime."
icra,None,"Fast, robust, continuous monocular egomotion computation","Andrew Jaegle,Stephen Phillips,Kostas Daniilidis,","We propose robust methods for estimating camera egomotion in noisy, real-world monocular image sequences in the general case of unknown observer rotation and translation with two views and a small baseline. This is a difficult problem because of the nonconvex cost function of the perspective camera motion equation and because of non-Gaussian noise arising from noisy optical flow estimates and scene non-rigidity. To address this problem, we introduce the expected residual likelihood method (ERL), which estimates confidence weights for noisy optical flow data using likelihood distributions of the residuals of the flow field under a range of counterfactual model parameters. We show that ERL is effective at identifying outliers and recovering appropriate confidence weights in many settings. We compare ERL to a novel formulation of the perspective camera motion equation using a lifted kernel, a recently proposed optimization framework for joint parameter and confidence weight estimation with good empirical properties. We incorporate these strategies into a motion estimation pipeline that avoids falling into local minima. We find that ERL outperforms the lifted kernel method and baseline monocular egomotion estimation strategies on the challenging KITTI dataset, while adding almost no runtime cost over baseline egomotion methods."

The proposed architecture is considered in an autonomous vision-based navigation with a teach-and-repeat algorithm based on detection and tracking of image salient points. The architecture has been evaluated and compared with a CPU-based solution on different platforms and the results indicate that the proposed FPGA-based implementation outperforms pure CPU solutions in the overall latency, speed, and power consumption."
icra,None,"Made to measure: Bespoke landmarks for 24-hour, all-weather localisation with a camera","Chris Linegar,Winston Churchill,Paul Newman,","This paper is about camera-only localisation in challenging outdoor environments, where changes in lighting, weather and season cause traditional localisation systems to fail. Conventional approaches to the localisation problem rely on point-features such as SIFT, SURF or BRIEF to associate landmark observations in the live image with landmarks stored in the map; however, these features are brittle to the severe appearance change routinely encountered in outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose an alternative to traditional point-features: we train place-specific linear SVM classifiers to recognise distinctive elements in the environment. The core contribution of this paper is an unsupervised mining algorithm which operates on a single mapping dataset to extract distinct elements from the environment for localisation. We evaluate our system on 205km of data collected from central Oxford over a period of six months in bright sun, night, rain, snow and at all times of the day. Our experiment consists of a comprehensive N-vs-N analysis on 22 laps of the approximately 10km route in central Oxford. With our proposed system, the portion of the route where localisation fails is reduced by a factor of 6, from 33.3% to 5.5%."
icra,None,Off the beaten track: Predicting localisation performance in visual teach and repeat,"Julie Dequaire,Chi Hay Tong,Winston Churchill,Ingmar Posner,","This paper proposes an appearance-based approach to estimating localisation performance in the context of visual teach and repeat. Specifically, it aims to estimate the likely corridor around a taught trajectory within which a vision-based localisation system is still able to localise itself. In contrast to prior art, our system is able to predict this localisation envelope for trajectories in similar, yet geographically distant locations where no repeat runs have yet been performed. Thus, by characterising the localisation performance in one region, we are able to predict performance in another. To achieve this, we leverage a Gaussian Process regressor to estimate the likely number of feature matches for any keyframe in the teach run, based on a combination of trajectory properties such as curvature and an appearance model of the keyframe. Using data from real traversals, we demonstrate that our approach performs as well as prior art when it comes to interpolating localisation performance based on a number of repeat runs, while also performing well at generalising performance estimation to freshly taught trajectories."
icra,None,Benefit of large field-of-view cameras for visual odometry,"Zichao Zhang,Henri Rebecq,Christian Forster,Davide Scaramuzza,","The transition of visual-odometry technology from research demonstrators to commercial applications naturally raises the question: “what is the optimal camera for vision-based motion estimation?” This question is crucial as the choice of camera has a tremendous impact on the robustness and accuracy of the employed visual odometry algorithm. While many properties of a camera (e.g. resolution, frame-rate, global-shutter/rolling-shutter) could be considered, in this work we focus on evaluating the impact of the camera field-of-view (FoV) and optics (i.e., fisheye or catadioptric) on the quality of the motion estimate. Since the motion-estimation performance depends highly on the geometry of the scene and the motion of the camera, we analyze two common operational environments in mobile robotics: an urban environment and an indoor scene. To confirm the theoretical observations, we implement a state-of-the-art VO pipeline that works with large FoV fisheye and catadioptric cameras. We evaluate the proposed VO pipeline in both synthetic and real experiments. The experiments point out that it is advantageous to use a large FoV camera (e.g., fisheye or catadioptric) for indoor scenes and a smaller FoV for urban canyon environments."
icra,None,On degeneracy of optimization-based state estimation problems,"Ji Zhang,Michael Kaess,Sanjiv Singh,","Positioning and mapping can be conducted accurately by state-of-the-art state estimation methods. However, reliability of these methods is largely based on avoiding degeneracy that can arise from cases such as scarcity of texture features for vision sensors and lack of geometrical structures for range sensors. Since the problems are inevitably solved in uncontrived environments where sensors cannot function with their highest quality, it is important for the estimation methods to be robust to degeneracy. This paper proposes an online method to mitigate for degeneracy in optimization-based problems, through analysis of geometric structure of the problem constraints. The method determines and separates degenerate directions in the state space, and only partially solves the problem in well-conditioned directions. We demonstrate utility of this method with data from a camera and lidar sensor pack to estimate 6-DOF ego-motion. Experimental results show that the system is able to improve estimation in environmentally degenerate cases, resulting in enhanced robustness for online positioning and mapping."
icra,None,PROBE-GK: Predictive robust estimation using generalized kernels,"Valentin Peretroukhin,William Vega-Brown,Nicholas Roy,Jonathan Kelly,","Many algorithms in computer vision and robotics make strong assumptions about uncertainty, and rely on the validity of these assumptions to produce accurate and consistent state estimates. In practice, dynamic environments may degrade sensor performance in predictable ways that cannot be captured with static uncertainty parameters. In this paper, we employ fast nonparametric Bayesian inference techniques to more accurately model sensor uncertainty. By setting a prior on observation uncertainty, we derive a predictive robust estimator, and show how our model can be learned from sample images, both with and without knowledge of the motion used to generate the data. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations, and report significant improvements in localization accuracy relative to a fixed noise model in several settings, including on synthetic data, the KITTI dataset, and our own experimental platform."
icra,None,Multi-level mapping: Real-time dense monocular SLAM,"W. Nicholas Greene,Kyel Ok,Peter Lommel,Nicholas Roy,","We present a method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using a monocular camera that is capable of reconstructing dense 3D geometry online without the aid of a graphics processing unit (GPU). Our key contribution is a multi-resolution depth estimation and spatial smoothing process that exploits the correlation between low-texture image regions and simple planar structure to adaptively scale the complexity of the generated keyframe depthmaps to the texture of the input imagery. High-texture image regions are represented at higher resolutions to capture fine detail, while low-texture regions are represented at coarser resolutions for smooth surfaces. The computational savings enabled by this approach allow for significantly increased reconstruction density and quality when compared to the state-of-the-art. The increased depthmap density also improves tracking performance as more constraints can contribute to the pose estimation. A video of experimental results is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/multi_level_mapping."
icra,None,On the workspace of suspended cable-driven parallel robots,"J-P. Merlet,","Workspace calculation for cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) differs from the one for robots with rigid legs as the main limiting factor is the satisfaction of the mechanical equilibrium, being given a model for the cable behavior. We are considering here 6-dof CDPR with n ≥ 6 cables and are investigating the calculation of horizontal cross-sections of the workspace under the assumption that the orientation of the platform is constant. We show that for non deformable or elastic mass-less cables it is possible to calculate the border of the workspace under the constraints τ min ≤ τ ≤ τ max where τ is the cable tension and τ min , τ max are constant thresholds. For sagging cables the calculation is much more complex: we present however a preliminary, computer intensive algorithm that allow to obtain an approximation of the cross-section as a set of boxes. We also emphasize that for CDPR the definition of the workspace as the set of poses that can be reached has to be considered stricto sensu and cannot be used for other purpose: for example the inclusion of a trajectory in the workspace is not a proof of the feasibility of this trajectory."
icra,None,Triple Scissor Extender: A 6-DOF lifting and positioning robot,"Daniel J. Gonzalez,H. Harry Asada,","We present a novel 6 DOF robotic mechanism for reaching high ceilings and positioning an end-effector. The end-effector is supported with three scissor mechanisms that extend towards the ceiling with 6 independent linear actuators moving the base ends of the individual scissors. The top point of each scissor is connected to one of three ball joints located at the three vertices of the top triangular plate holding the end-effector. Coordinated motion of the 6 linear actuators at the base allows the end-effector to reach an arbitrary position with an arbitrary orientation. The design concept of the Triple Scissor Extender is presented, followed by kinematic modeling and analysis of the the Inverse Jacobian relating actuator velocities to the end-effector velocities. The Inverse Jacobian eigenvalues are determined for diverse configurations in order to characterize the kinematic properties. A proof-of-concept prototype has been designed and built. The Inverse Jacobian for use in differential control is evaluated through experiments."
icra,None,Dynamic isotropy in 3-DOF Gantry Tau robots - an analytical study,"Behrouz Afzali-Far,Per Lidström,Anders Robertsson,","3-DOF Gantry Tau is a type of parallel robot, consisting of six struts configured in three clusters, which provides three translational DOFs. It has increasing industrial use in applications where large workspace and high stiffness are required. In fact, the concept of dynamic isotropy, where all the natural frequencies of a system are equal, can be employed in order to effectively optimize the geometry of robots. However, no study on dynamic isotropy of Gantry Tau robots has yet been reported in the literature. In this paper, the problem of dynamic isotropy in 3-DOF Gantry Tau robots is analytically addressed. Firstly, the kinematics is established based on a general approach with 36 geometric variables. Jacobian and stiffness matrices are also investigated where the struts are considered to be axially flexible. Subsequently, analytical solutions to obtain both a decoupled stiffness matrix and a complete dynamic isotropy are presented. Finally, as an example, dynamically isotropic geometries of a Gantry Tau robot are calculated, for a reference platform, using the developed analytical method."

The Cartesian stiffness matrix of the robots is modeled with the virtual spring approach. By means of a nondimensionalization of the stiffness matrix, the 6 × 6 inhomogeneous stiffness matrix is decomposed into two homogeneous sub-matrices, of which two performance indices, corresponding to the translational and rotational stiffnesses, are defined to evaluate the stiffness behaviors of the manipulators. A comparative study among the robot counterparts is carried out with respect to the elasto-static performance."
icra,None,Determination of the wrench-closure translational workspace in closed-form for cable-driven parallel robots,"Andreas Pott,Werner Kraus,","Workspace determination for robots is an important step in analysis and synthesis. A couple of methods for computing the wrench-closure workspace of cable-driven parallel robots were reported in the literature but all methods tend to be time consuming. In this paper, a new algorithm is presented that exploits different techniques to speed up the computation. Pre-computation is largely exploited and benefit are gained both from considerations in computer algebra and efficient numerical routines. Results from the computation of the translational (sometimes also called constant orientation) wrench-closure workspace are presented and performance values are provided. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the method proposed in this paper is superior in terms of computational time to any other approach for workspace computation."
icra,None,A comparison of the yaw constraining performance of SCARA-tau parallel manipulator variants via screw theory,"Mats Isaksson,Kristan Marlow,Torgny Brogårdh,Anders Eriksson,","The SCARA-Tau parallel manipulator was derived with the objective to overcome the limited workspace-to-footprint ratio of the DELTA parallel manipulator while maintaining its many benefits. The SCARA-Tau family has later been extended and a large number of variants have been proposed. In this paper, we analyse four of these variants, which together encompass the main differences between all the proposed SCARA-Tau manipulators. The analysed manipulator variants utilise an identical arrangement of five of the six linkages connecting the actuated arms and the manipulated platform and exhibit the same input-output Jacobian. The normalised reciprocal product between the wrench of the sixth linkage and the twist of the platform occurring without this linkage provides a measure on how effectively the sixth linkage constrains the manipulated platform. A comparison of the manipulator variants with respect to this measure demonstrates each variants suitability for specific applications."
icra,None,Energy efficiency of cable-driven parallel robots,"Werner Kraus,Alexander Spiller,Andreas Pott,","Cable-driven parallel robots, hereinafter referred to as cable robots, use cables to manipulate a mobile platform with 6 DOF. Cable robots have a low moved mass, as the winches with the servo drives are fixed to the machine frame and light weight synthetic fiber cables can be used. Therefore, cable robots are assumed to have a good energy efficiency. To analyze the energy efficiency in detail, we establish an energy consumption model for a cable robot and parametrize it for the cable robot IPAnema 3. Losses in the mechanical parts like winches as well as electrical losses in the servo amplifier and recuperation effects are taken into account. The analysis of the energy consumption shows that the mechanical losses are dominant. The losses occur especially during movement of the robot while the energy needed for statically balancing the load is quite low. We can experimentally determine a maximum winch efficiency of 85%. For dimensioning the drive, one has to add approximately one third of the torque to account for the friction in the mechanics. In a fully-constrained cable robot, the energy consumption can be influenced by the internal tension in a range of 20%. We also compare the energy efficiency of the cable robot with an industrial robot. The comparison shows, that both robots consume almost the same amount of energy."
icra,None,Wire-driven parallel robotic system and its control for maintenance of offshore wind turbines,"Dong Gun Lee,Sehoon Oh,Hyoung Il Son,","This paper describes a wire-driven parallel robotic system for the maintenance of offshore wind turbines. This robotic system vertically climbs on towers or blades, and performs cleaning and inspection using waterjets and phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) devices, respectively. For a detailed mechanical design, mechanisms for (1) climbing towers or blades, (2) transition motion between towers and blades, (3) gripping blades, and (4) contact motion between PAUT devices and blade surfaces are proposed so that the robotic system can maneuver on towers and blades. For the motion analysis of the robotic system, nonholonomic constraints are analyzed and utilized in height and attitude control schemes, which are proposed to adapt varying nonholonomic constraints of blade surface and achieve the climbing motion on towers and blades. To validate these control schemes, we conduct experiment and analyze the performance of the proposed control schemes. The results show that the height and attitude control schemes for the robotic system do achieve the control goals and overcome the control challenges."

In this paper, we present origami-based robots that can be ingested into the stomach, locomote to a desired location, patch a wound, remove a foreign body, deliver drugs, and biodegrade. We designed and fabricated composite material sheets for a biocompatible and biodegradable robot that can be encapsulated in ice for delivery through the esophagus, embed a drug layer that is passively released to a wounded area, and be remotely controlled to carry out underwater maneuvers specific to the tasks using magnetic fields. The performances of the robots are demonstrated in a simulated physical environment consisting of an esophagus and stomach with properties similar to the biological organs."
icra,None,Considerations for follow-the-leader motion of extensible tendon-driven continuum robots,"Maria Neumann,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,","Path following and follow-the-leader motion is particularly desirable for minimally-invasive surgery in confined spaces which can only be reached using tortuous paths, e.g. through natural orifices. While path following and followthe- leader motion can be achieved by hyper-redundant snake robots, their size is usually not applicable for medical applications. Continuum robots, such as tendon-driven or concentric tube mechanisms, fulfill the size requirements for minimally invasive surgery, but yet follow-the-leader motion is not inherently provided. In fact, parameters of the manipulator's section curvatures and translation have to be chosen wisely a priori. In this paper, we consider a tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. After reformulating the forward kinematics model, we formulate prerequisites for follow-the-leader motion and present a general approach to determine a sequence of robot configurations to achieve follow-the-leader motion along a given 3D path. We evaluate our approach in a series of simulations with 3D paths composed of constant curvature arcs and general 3D paths described by B-spline curves. Our results show that mean path errors <;0.4mm and mean tip errors <;1.6mm can theoretically be achieved for constant curvature paths and <;2mm and <;3.1mm for general B-spline curves respectively."
icra,None,Complementary model update: A method for simultaneous registration and stiffness mapping in flexible environments,"Rangaprasad Arun Srivatsan,Elif Ayvali,Long Wang,Rajarshi Roy,,,","Registering a surgical tool to an a priori model of the environment is an important first step in computer-aided surgery. In this paper we present an approach for simultaneous registration and stiffness mapping using blind exploration of flexible environments. During contact-based exploration of flexible environments, the physical interaction with the environment can induce local deformation, leading to erroneous registration if not accounted for. To overcome this issue, a new registration method called complementary model update (CMU), is introduced. By incorporating measurements of the contact force, and contact location, we minimize a unique objective function to cancel out the effect of local deformation. We are thus able to acquire the necessary registration parameters using both geometry and stiffness information. The proposed CMU method is evaluated in simulation and using experimental data obtained by probing silicone models and an ex vivo organ."
icra,None,Using Bayesian optimization to guide probing of a flexible environment for simultaneous registration and stiffness mapping,"Elif Ayvali,Rangaprasad Arun Srivatsan,Long Wang,Rajarshi Roy,,,","One of the goals of computer-aided surgery is to register intraoperative data to preoperative model of the anatomy, and hence add complementary information that can facilitate the task of surgical navigation. In this context, mechanical palpation can reveal critical anatomical features such as arteries and cancerous lumps which are stiffer than the surrounding tissue. This work uses position and force measurements obtained during mechanical palpation for registration and stiffness mapping. Prior approaches, including our own, exhaustively palpated the entire organ to achieve this goal. To overcome the costly palpation of the entire organ, a Bayesian optimization framework is introduced to guide the end effector to palpate stiff regions while simultaneously updating the registration of the end effector to an a priori geometric model of the organ, hence enabling the fusion of intraoperative data into the a priori model obtained through imaging. This new framework uses Gaussian processes to model the stiffness distribution and Bayesian optimization to direct where to sample next for maximum information gain. The proposed method was evaluated with experimental data obtained using a Cartesian robot interacting with a silicone organ model and an ex vivo porcine liver."
icra,None,Toward real-time 3D ultrasound registration-based visual servoing for interventional navigation,"Oliver Zettinig,Bernhard Fuerst,Risto Kojcev,Marco Esposito,Mehrdad Salehi,,,,,,","While intraoperative imaging is commonly used to guide surgical interventions, automatic robotic support for image-guided navigation has not yet been established in clinical routine. In this paper, we propose a novel visual servoing framework that combines, for the first time, full image-based 3D ultrasound registration with a real-time servo-control scheme. Paired with multi-modal fusion to a pre-interventional plan such as an annotated needle insertion path, it thus allows tracking a target anatomy, continuously updating the plan as the target moves, and keeping a needle guide aligned for accurate manual insertion. The presented system includes a motorized 3D ultrasound transducer mounted on a force-controlled robot and a GPU-based image processing toolkit. The tracking accuracy of our framework is validated on a geometric agar/gelatin phantom using a second robot, achieving positioning errors of on average 0.42-0.44 mm. With compounding and registration runtimes of up to total around 550 ms, real-time performance comes into reach. We also present initial results on a spine phantom, demonstrating the feasibility of our system for lumbar spine injections."
icra,None,Dry-wireless EEG and asynchronous adaptive feature extraction towards a plug-and-play co-adaptive brain robot interface,"Giuseppe Lisi,Masashi Hamaya,Tomoyuki Noda,Jun Morimoto,","This paper introduces a novel asynchronous adaptive brain machine interface (BMI), based on a dry-wireless headset, to trigger the movement of a lower limb exoskeleton robot by foot motor imagery. Specifically, it addresses two issues that are critical for the development of a plug-and-play brain robot interface (BRI): setup-time and the nonstationarity of the electroencephalogram (EEG). The former is solved by a dry-wireless headset that reduces setup-time compared to gel-based systems, and removes the nuisance of cables. The latter has been extensively studied in the literature, leading to effective adaptive algorithms in synchronous BMI. However, asynchronous BMI has received little attention. We propose an extension of state-of-the-art adaptive methods by defining the forgetting factors according to the time constant of the exponential moving average. In addition, we propose feature adaptation as opposed to the standard bias adaptation of a linear classifier. After calibrating the decoder, the subject with a reliable classification of sensorimotor rhythms was asked to trigger robot squatting. The motion was successfully initialized by foot motor imagery; with an essential contribution of the proposed adaptive BMI, which makes features less prone to nonstationarities and improves classification performance compared to standard adaptive methods. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop a plug-and-play co-adaptive BRI for neuromotor rehabilitation."

This is demonstrated using a platform called Bellabot that incorporates an array of biomimetic tactile whiskers, actuated using electro-active polymer artificial muscles, a camera to provide visual error feedback, and a standard industrial robotic manipulator. The algorithm learns to accommodate imperfections in the sensory map that may be as a result of poor manufacturing tolerances or damage to the sensory array. Such an ability is an important pre-requisite for robust tactile robotic systems operating in the real-world for extended periods of time. In this work the sensory maps have been purposely distorted in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm."
icra,None,Microneedle-based high-density surface EMG interface with high selectivity for finger movement recognition,"Minjae Kim,Dong Sung Kim,Wan Kyun Chung,","The human hand shows complex motor skills and is widely used in activities in daily living. Thus, finger movement recognition has many potential applications in rehabilitation, tele-operation, and prosthetic hands. Several surface electromyography (sEMG) interfaces have been developed to recognize finger motion without impeding finger movement. However, conventional interfaces are impractical because they require a large skin contact area, which inconveniences users and restricts their clothing. In this paper, we propose a metal microneedle-based high-density (MNHD) sEMG interface for finger movement recognition, which is smaller than a traditional wet electrode. The highly selective extraction of the sEMG signal was demonstrated in static finger flexion tests and fingertip force estimation."
icra,None,What lies behind: Recovering hidden shape in dense mapping,"Michael Tanner,Pedro Piniés,Lina María Paz,Paul Newman,","In mobile robotics applications, generation of accurate static maps is encumbered by the presence of ephemeral objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, or bicycles. We propose a method to process a sequence of laser point clouds and back-fill dense surfaces into gaps caused by removing objects from the scene - a valuable tool in scenarios where resource constraints permit only one mapping pass in a particular region. Our method processes laser scans in a three-dimensional voxel grid using the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) and then uses a Total Variation (TV) regulariser with a Kernel Conditional Density Estimation (KCDE) “soft” data term to interpolate missing surfaces. Using four scenarios captured with a push-broom 2D laser, our technique infills approximately 20 m2 of missing surface area for each removed object. Our reconstruction's median error ranges between 5.64 cm - 9.24 cm with standard deviations between 4.57 cm - 6.08 cm."
icra,None,Surface reconstruction from image space adjacency of lines using breadth-first plane search,"Gerhard Mentges,Rolf-Rainer Grigat,","In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view method for surface reconstruction from matched line segments with applications to robotic mapping and image-based rendering. Starting from 3D line segments and poses obtained via Line-SLAM, we project segments from multiple frames into keyframes for image-space analysis. For each keyframe, a grid of image faces is created by optimized intersection of the segment projection lines. These faces define a segment adjacency graph, wherein we perform our Breadth-First Plane Search (BFPS). The found plane hypotheses are merged maximally with respect to a structure-preserving criterion by growing coplanar regions across the graph. Hypotheses violating the visibility constraint are discarded based on fast per-face and mostly nongeometrical evaluation of the scene and image graph. Finally, each image face gets back-projected onto an optimal plane to obtain a 3D surface model. The presented system is a complete and automatic solution suitable for mapping an environment in real-time scenarios like robotic exploration. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several indoor scenes of varying complexity. Compared to a pure 3D analysis of segments, we see a speed-up by one to almost two orders of magnitude, while still improving on reconstruction accuracy."
icra,None,"Fast, accurate gaussian process occupancy maps via test-data octrees and nested Bayesian fusion","Jinkun Wang,Brendan Englot,","We present a novel algorithm to produce descriptive online 3D occupancy maps using Gaussian processes (GPs). GP regression and classification have met with recent success in their application to robot mapping, as GPs are capable of expressing rich correlation among map cells and sensor data. However, the cubic computational complexity has limited its application to large-scale mapping and online use. In this paper we address this issue first by proposing test-data octrees, octrees within blocks of the map that prune away nodes of the same state, condensing the number of test data used in a regression, in addition to allowing fast data retrieval. We also propose a nested Bayesian committee machine which, after new sensor data is partitioned among several GP regressions, fuses the result and updates the map with greatly reduced complexity. Finally, by adjusting the range of influence of the training data and tuning a variance threshold implemented in our method's binary classification step, we are able to control the richness of inference achieved by GPs - and its tradeoff with classification accuracy. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated with both simulated and real data, demonstrating that the method may serve both as an improved-accuracy classifier, and as a predictive tool to support autonomous navigation."
icra,None,"Probabilistic map fusion for fast, incremental occupancy mapping with 3D Hilbert maps","Kevin Doherty,Jinkun Wang,Brendan Englot,","We present a novel formulation of Hilbert mapping in which we construct a global occupancy map by incrementally fusing local overlapping Hilbert maps. Rather than maintain a single supervised learning model for the entire map, a new model is trained with each of a robot's range scans, and queried at all points within the robot's perceptual field. We treat the probabilistic output of the classifier as a sensor, employing sensor fusion to merge local maps. This formulation allows Hilbert mapping to be used incrementally in real-world mapping scenarios with overlap between sensor observations. The methodology is applied to three-dimensional map-building, and evaluated using real and simulated 3D range data."

Although many map partitioning algorithms have been proposed for various applications there is a lack of comparative studies on these different algorithms. This paper surveys the literature on room segmentation and provides four publicly available implementations of popular methods, which target the semantic mapping domain and are tuned to yield segmentations into complete rooms. In an attempt to provide new users of such technologies guidance in the choice of map segmentation algorithm, those methods are compared qualitatively and quantitatively using several criteria.

We address mapping as the task of classifying the robot's environment between free and occupied regions. The biggest challenge when using Gaussian processes for this task is the size of the input datasets. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel kernel, able to use as input data aggregated into two-dimensional cells. Using this kernel, we achieve comparable performance to previous Gaussian process occupancy mapping techniques in a fraction of the time taken by them. The approach can also be used to convert popular occupancy grids into continuous Gaussian process occupancy maps."

icra,None,Towards lifelong feature-based mapping in semi-static environments,"David M. Rosen,Julian Mason,John J. Leonard,","The feature-based graphical approach to robotic mapping provides a representationally rich and computationally efficient framework for an autonomous agent to learn a model of its environment. However, this formulation does not naturally support long-term autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change; in reality, “everything changes and nothing stands still, ” and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence filter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment. By incorporating this feature persistence estimation into current state-of-the-art graphical mapping techniques, we obtain a flexible, computationally efficient, and information-theoretically rigorous framework for lifelong environmental modeling in an ever-changing world."

Georgiou,,,,,,","In this paper, we address the problem of cooperative mapping (CM) using datasets collected by multiple users at different times, when the transformation between the users' starting poses is unknown. Specifically, we formulate CM as a constrained optimization problem, where each user's independently estimated trajectory and map are combined in a single map by imposing geometric constraints between commonly-observed point and line features. Furthermore, our formulation allows for modularity since new/old maps (or parts of them) can be easily added/removed with no impact on the remaining ones. Additionally, the proposed CM algorithm lends itself, for the most part, to parallel implementations, hence gaining in speed. Experimental results based on visual and inertial measurements collected from four users within two large buildings are used to assess the performance of the proposed CM algorithm."
icra,None,A passivity-based approach for trajectory tracking and link-side damping of compliantly actuated robots,"Manuel Keppler,Dominic Lakatos,Christian Ott,Alin Albu-Schäffer,","This paper presents a control method to implement trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection characteristics for the link-side dynamics of compliantly actuated robots with nonlinear spring characteristics. This is achieved by introducing new motor coordinates reflecting the damping and feedforward terms and shaping the dynamics of the motor such that it structurally equals the dynamics in the original coordinates. Thus, the approach achieves the control goal while changing the original plant dynamics only to a minimum extent. Passivity, stability, and convergence properties of the closed loop dynamics are proven. The performance of the control approach has been experimentally evaluated on the variable stiffness robot arm DLR Hand Arm System, where the stiffness in each of the joints is highly nonlinear. To our best knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated tracking controller for compliantly actuated robots with nonlinear elastic elements."
icra,None,Simultaneous position and stiffness control for an inflatable soft robot,"Morgan T. Gillespie,Charles M. Best,Marc D. Killpack,","Soft robot research has led to the development of platforms that should allow for better performance when working in uncertain or dynamic environments. The potential improvement in performance of these platforms ranges from mechanical robustness to high forces, to applying lower incidental contact forces in uncertain situations. However, the promise of these platforms is limited by the difficulty of controlling them. In this paper, we present preliminary results on simultaneously controlling stiffness and position for a pneumatically actuated soft robot. Improving on our prior work, we show that by including the pressure in our soft robot actuation chambers as state variables we can improve our average rise time by up to 137%, settling time by 119%, and overshoot by 853%. In addition to these improvements, we can now control both joint position and stiffness simultaneously. This performance improvement comes from using Model Predictive Control running at 300 Hz with improved dynamic models of the soft robot. High performance control of soft robot joints, such as the joint presented in this paper, will enable a wide range of robot applications that were previously difficult or impossible due to the rigid nature of traditional robot linkages and actuation schemes."

In existing SEA-driven robot systems, the control objective is usually specified as a predefined trajectory or an impedance model that describes the relationship between the desired motion of robot and the external force, and controllers are always activated to regulate the desired motion or the desired impedance model. In this paper, a region control scheme is proposed for robots driven by SEAs, where the control objective is specified as a region, instead of trajectory or desired impedance. The region control has the advantage of flexibility, in the sense that the robot is able to move freely inside the desired region and thus compliant with the environment or physical interactions with humans. Though the overall dynamics that includes both actuator and robot dynamics is a fourth-order system, the proposed control method does not require the high-order derivatives or the construction of any observer. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method."

The dynamically consistent extended formulation was used in order to achieve a dynamically decoupled redundancy resolution, while a null-motion feedback was implemented that improves the tracking of the null-motion. Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures are proposed as applications of the control approach formulated in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach was verified in simulation by using the Kuka LBR 7 iiwa R800 robot arm."

The present paper proposes a position-based adaptive force control strategy, that relies on a novel method for the on line estimation of the environment stiffness. The control design is targeted to industrial controller structures and it is theoretically proven to be robust to time varying estimation errors of the environment stiffness and joint friction disturbances. The estimation algorithm succeeds in identifying the environment stiffness even in presence of geometrical irregularities of the contact surface during motion. The identification and control approaches are experimentally validated on an industrial robot equipped with a force sensor."
icra,None,A model compensation-prediction scheme for control of micromanipulation systems with a single feedback loop,"Weize Zhang,Juntian Qu,Xinyu Liu,","Many micromanipulation systems employ sensorless actuators and possess unknown modeling errors, feedback measurement noise, and time delays. Conventional modelbased control schemes ignore some of these characteristics, and thus sacrifice the control performance of the system. This paper presents a new model compensation-prediction scheme for control of micromanipulation systems, which estimates the unknown modeling errors from single noisy feedback measurement and predicts and compensate the system time delay. This approach combines two modeling errors into a single equivalent error through mathematical transformation, and estimates the combined term using a noise-insensitive extended high-gain observer (EHGO). After removing the unknown term, the system is then transformed into a time invariant form, and a Smith predictor is implemented to predict and compensate the time delay. The effectiveness of the proposed compensation-prediction scheme is demonstrated by both numerical simulation and experiments of two typical micromanipulation systems. The results show that this method is able to significantly improve the control performance of a conventional PID controller by simultaneously reducing the settling time and overshoot of the system."
icra,None,Observer based impedance control of a pneumatic system with long transmission lines,"Melih Turkseven,Jun Ueda,","Pneumatic actuation has gained popularity in robotics, for its low maintenance, high efficiency and compactness. A recent direction is to build pneumatically driven non-magnetic platforms for robotic rehabilitation monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Control of such systems is challenging as they involve long transmission lines to satisfy MR-compatibility requirements and direct pressure measurement at the actuator is not available. This paper presents a control algorithm that provides an accurate impedance control for pneumatic systems with long transmission lines. The algorithm involves a pressure observer based on force and displacement feedback to compensate for the lack of pressure measurement. The observed pressures are utilized in a robust controller for force tracking. The described method is tested on a system with 7 meters long transmission lines. Impedance control using the presented observer achieved stable force tracking up to 1.5 Hz, lowering mean squared error by up to %25."

In KONTUR-2, Earth and ISS have been used as a test-bed to evaluate and demonstrate a new technology for real-time telemanipulation from space. During the August 2015' experiments campaign, a cosmonaut teleoperated a robot manipulator located in Germany, using a force-feedback joystick from the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS). The focus of the paper is on the design and performance of the bilateral controller between ISS joystick and Earth robot. The controller is based on a 4-Channels architecture in which stability is guaranteed through passivity and the Time Delay Power Network (TDPN) concept. We show how the proposed approach successfully fulfills mission requirements, specially those related to system operation through space links and internet channels, involving time delays and data losses of different nature."

Company,","Image mosaicing has gained increasing attention in the last few years, specially for robotic mapping applications. Due to the richness of the sensor data provided, several science fields require the creation of large-area image mosaics for further analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic image mosaicing approach that can produce seamless composites under different configurations in a reasonable amount of time. Our approach is based on a multi-threaded architecture which allows us to execute the different steps of the algorithm simultaneously. To find the topology of the environment, we use a visual index based on a Bag-of-Binary-Words scheme, which is built in an online manner, and thus avoids the classic training step. Our approach is validated under different environments and camera configurations, showing that it can be used on several scenarios producing coherent results in all of them. Furthermore, the implementation of the algorithm is made public to the community."

The system extracts the 3D poses of the markers including one that, by pulsating at a predefined frequency, provides an unique platform ID. We discuss how the camera field of view can be explored in presence of multiple targets, and what are the conditions on the system visibility that lead to the establishment of bidirectional sensing between robots with similar sensing capabilities. A visibility analysis is conducted to show that the developed relative localization system meets such requirements, and a closed-loop experiment is used to validate its performance under these conditions. Finally, its performance is compared with other results from the literature, and a metric is established with the intent of mapping different design solutions, facilitating design choices in presence of different requirements."
icra,None,Cooperative sensor fault recovery in multi-UAV systems,"Alejandro Suarez,Guillermo Heredia,Anibal Ollero,","This paper presents the design and experimental validation of a Fault Detection, Identification and Recovery (FDIR) system intended for multi-UAV applications. The system exploits the information provided by internal position, attitude and visual sensors onboard the UAVs of the fleet for detecting faults in the measurements of the position and attitude sensors of any of the member vehicles. Considering the observations provided by two or more UAVs in a cooperative way, it is possible to identify the source of the fault, but also implement a Cooperative Virtual Sensor (CVS) which provides a redundant position and velocity estimation of the faulty UAV that can be used for replacing its internal sensor. The vision-based FDIR system has been validated experimentally with quadrotors in an indoor testbed. In particular, fault detection and identification has been evaluated injecting a fault pattern offline on the position measurements, while the CVS has been applied in real time for the recovery phase."
icra,None,Rate-adaptive multicast video streaming from teams of micro aerial vehicles,"Raheeb Muzaffar,Vladimir Vukadinovic,Andrea Cavallaro,","Video multicasting from cameras mounted on micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is desirable for applications such as search and rescue, surveillance and disaster management. Because of the mobility of the video sources and the high data-rate of videos, the transmission rate should be adapted to the task at hand. Rate-adaptive video multicast streaming in 802.11 requires wireless link estimation as well as frequent feedback from multiple receivers. We propose an application layer rate-adaptive video multicast streaming framework using 802.11 adhoc network that is applicable when both the sender and the receiver nodes are mobile. The receiver nodes of a multicast group are dynamically elected based on their changing link conditions to gain feedback. An Application Layer Video Multicast Gateway (ALVM-GW) adapts the transmission rate and the video encoding rate based on the received feedback. Emulation results show that the proposed approach has balanced performance in terms of goodput, delay and packet loss."

A sensor fusion scheme using an extended Kalman filter is designed to estimate the positions and orientations of all the vehicles from these distributed measurements. The estimation is completed by a formation control to maximize the overlapping fields of view of the vehicles.

The top layer, on the basis of the desired mission, determines the end-effector desired trajectory for each manipulator, while the middle layer is in charge of computing the motion references in order to track such end-effectors trajectories coming from the upper layer. Finally the bottom layer is a low level motion controller, which tracks the motion references. The overall mission is decomposed in a set of elementary behaviors which are combined together, through the Null Space-based Behavioral (NSB) approach, into more complex compounds behaviors. The proposed framework has been tested conducting an experimental campaign."

Each vehicle is steered to the specified location by a path planner that follows the shortest path while avoiding collisions. The control architecture has been validated both in simulations and in experiments on a fleet of three vehicles."
icra,None,Landing of a fixed-wing UAV on a mobile ground vehicle,"Tin Muskardin,Georg Balmer,Sven Wlach,Konstantin Kondak,Maximilian Laiacker,,","The development of solar-powered high-altitude UAV has gained increasing attention in the recent years. Several aircraft have had successful flights in the stratosphere, but despite advances in lightweight design they can only carry small payloads compared to the total takeoff mass. This paper suggests to eliminate the need for a landing gear by landing on a mobile ground vehicle. This would not only increase the payload capacity, but also simplify landings in crosswind conditions and thus increase the operational availability. A system with a small UAV and a car-mounted landing platform is prepared as a technology demonstrator. Different aspects of the landing problem are studied in simulations and real experiments and algorithms for the cooperative control of both vehicles are proposed. Simulations as well as experiments with the real car and a simulated UAV show the feasibility of such landings."

We present a new nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) technique, Nonlinear Partial Enumeration (NPE), that combines online and offline computation in a nonlinear version of the partial enumeration method for MPC, thereby dramatically decreasing the compute time per control iteration. We apply NPE to the problem of MAV flight and demonstrate through a set of simulation trials that NPE outperforms other fast control methodologies during aggressive motion and enables the system to learn a reusable set of local feedback controllers that enable more efficient operation over time."
icra,None,Assistive collision avoidance for quadrotor swarm teleoperation,"Dingjiang Zhou,Mac Schwager,","This paper presents a method for controlling quadrotor swarms in an environment with obstacles, with an intuitive human-swarm interface operated by a single human user. Our method allows for the quadrotor swarm to maintain a desired formation, while also keeping the quadrotors a safe distance from obstacles and from one another. We use a Virtual Rigid Body abstraction to provide a bridge between the single human user and the quadrotor swarm, so that a human user can fly an arbitrarily large quadrotor swarm from a single joystick. By applying multiple vector fields, collisions are automatically avoided within the swarm of quadrotors, and between the quadrotors and obstacles, while the Virtual Rigid Body is controlled by the human user. Our method is demonstrated in hardware experiments with groups of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles teleoperated by a single human operator in a motion capture system."

Generating and visualizing floor plans in real-time helps the operator assess the quality and coverage of capture data. Building a portable capture platform necessitates operating under limited computational resources. We present the approach used in our backpack mapping platform which achieves real-time mapping and loop closure at a 5 cm resolution. To achieve realtime loop closure, we use a branch-and-bound approach for computing scan-to-submap matches as constraints. We provide experimental results and comparisons to other well known approaches which show that, in terms of quality, our approach is competitive with established techniques."
icra,None,Improving accuracy of feature-based RGB-D SLAM by modeling spatial uncertainty of point features,"Dominik Belter,Michał Nowicki,Piotr Skrzypczyński,","Many recent solutions to the RGB-D SLAM problem use the pose-graph optimization approach, which marginalizes out the actual depth measurements. In this paper we employ the same type of factor graph optimization, but we investigate the gains coming from maintaining a map of RGBD point features and modeling the spatial uncertainty of these features. We demonstrate that RGB-D SLAM accuracy can be increased by employing uncertainty models reflecting the actual errors introduced by measurements and image processing. The new approach is validated in simulations and in experiments involving publicly available data sets to ensure that our results are verifiable."

In this paper, we propose a real-time capable RGB-D SLAM system that consistently integrates frame-to-keyframe and frame-to-plane alignment. Our method models the environment with a global plane model and - besides direct image alignment - it uses the planes for tracking and global graph optimization. This way, our method makes use of the dense image information available in keyframes for accurate short-term tracking. At the same time it uses a global model to reduce drift. Both components are integrated consistently in an expectation-maximization framework. In experiments, we demonstrate the benefits our approach and its state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks."

Zeeshan Zia,Luigi Nardi,Andrew Jack,Emanuele Vespa,Bruno Bodin,,,","SLAM has matured significantly over the past few years, and is beginning to appear in serious commercial products. While new SLAM systems are being proposed at every conference, evaluation is often restricted to qualitative visualizations or accuracy estimation against a ground truth. This is due to the lack of benchmarking methodologies which can holistically and quantitatively evaluate these systems. Further investigation at the level of individual kernels and parameter spaces of SLAM pipelines is non-existent, which is absolutely essential for systems research and integration. We extend the recently introduced SLAMBench framework to allow comparing two state-of-the-art SLAM pipelines, namely KinectFusion and LSD-SLAM, along the metrics of accuracy, energy consumption, and processing frame rate on two different hardware platforms, namely a desktop and an embedded device. We also analyze the pipelines at the level of individual kernels and explore their algorithmic and hardware design spaces for the first time, yielding valuable insights."
icra,None,Pinpoint SLAM: A hybrid of 2D and 3D simultaneous localization and mapping for RGB-D sensors,"Esra Ataer-Cansizoglu,Yuichi Taguchi,Srikumar Ramalingam,","Conventional SLAM systems with an RGB-D sensor use depth measurements only in a limited depth range due to hardware limitation and noise of the sensor, ignoring regions that are too far or too close from the sensor. Such systems introduce registration errors especially in scenes with large depth variations. In this paper, we present a novel RGB-D SLAM system that makes use of both 2D and 3D measurements. Our system first extracts keypoints from RGB images and generates 2D and 3D point features from the keypoints with invalid and valid depth values, respectively. It then establishes 3D-to-3D, 2D-to-3D, and 2D-to-2D point correspondences among frames. For the 2D-to-3D point correspondences, we use the rays defined by the 2D point features to “pinpoint” the corresponding 3D point features, generating longer-range constraints than using only 3D-to-3D correspondences. For the 2D-to-2D point correspondences, we triangulate the rays to generate 3D points that are used as 3D point features in the subsequent process. We use the hybrid correspondences in both online SLAM and offline postprocessing: the online SLAM focuses more on the speed by computing correspondences among consecutive frames for real-time operations, while the offline postprocessing generates more correspondences among all the frames for higher accuracy. The results on RGB-D SLAM benchmarks show that the online SLAM provides higher accuracy than conventional SLAM systems, while the postprocessing further improves the accuracy."
icra,None,Direct semi-dense SLAM for rolling shutter cameras,"Jae-Hak Kim,Cesar Cadena,Ian Reid,","In this paper, we present a monocular Direct and Semi-dense SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) system for rolling shutter cameras. In a rolling shutter camera, the pose is different for each row of each image, and this yields poor pose estimates and poor structure estimates when using a state-of-the-art semi-dense direct method designed for global shutter cameras. To address this issue in tracking, we model the smooth and continuous camera trajectory using a B-spline curve of degree k??1 for poses in the Lie algebra, se(3).We solve for the camera poses at each row-time by a direct optimisation of photometric error as a function of the control points of the spline. Likewise for mapping, we develop generalised epipolar geometry for the rolling shutter case and solve for point depths using photometric error. Although each of these issues has been previously tackled, to the best of our knowledge ours is the first full solution to monocular, direct (feature-less) SLAM. We benchmark our method for pose accuracy and map accuracy against the state-of-the-art semi-dense SLAM system, LSD-SLAM, demonstrating the improved efficacy of our approach when using rolling shutter cameras via synthetic sequences with known ground-truth and real sequences."
icra,None,Tree-connectivity: Evaluating the graphical structure of SLAM,"Kasra Khosoussi,Shoudong Huang,Gamini Dissanayake,","Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in robotics, and a number of related problems that arise in sensor networks are instances of estimation problems over weighted graphs. This paper studies the relation between the graphical representation of such problems and estimationtheoretic concepts such as the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and D-optimality. We prove that the weighted number of spanning trees, as a graph connectivity metric, is closely related to the determinant of CRLB. This metric can be efficiently computed for large graphs by exploiting the sparse structure of underlying estimation problems. Our analysis is validated using experiments with publicly available pose-graph SLAM datasets."
icra,None,Fast depth edge detection and edge based RGB-D SLAM,"Laurie Bose,Arthur Richards,",This paper presents a method of occluding depth edge-detection targeted towards RGB-D video streams and explores the use of these and other edge features in RGB-D SLAM. The proposed depth edge-detection approach uses prior information obtained from the previous RGB-D video frame to determine which areas of the current depth image are likely to contain edges due to image similarity. By limiting the search for edges to these areas a significant amount of computation time is saved compared to searching the entire image. Pixels belonging to both the depth and colour edges of an RGB-D image can be back projected using the depth component to form 3D point clouds of edge points. Registration between such edge point clouds is achieved using ICP and we present a realtime RGB-D SLAM system utilizing such back projected edge features. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the performance of both the proposed depth edge-detection and SLAM system using publicly available datasets.
icra,None,Visual-inertial direct SLAM,"Alejo Concha,Giuseppe Loianno,Vijay Kumar,Javier Civera,","The so-called direct visual SLAM methods have shown a great potential in estimating a semidense or fully dense reconstruction of the scene, in contrast to the sparse reconstructions of the traditional feature-based algorithms. In this paper, we propose for the first time a direct, tightly-coupled formulation for the combination of visual and inertial data. Our algorithm runs in real-time on a standard CPU. The processing is split in three threads. The first thread runs at frame rate and estimates the camera motion by a joint non-linear optimization from visual and inertial data given a semidense map. The second one creates a semidense map of high-gradient areas only for camera tracking purposes. Finally, the third thread estimates a fully dense reconstruction of the scene at a lower frame rate. We have evaluated our algorithm in several real sequences with ground truth trajectory data, showing a state-of-the-art performance."
icra,None,A unified representation for application of architectural constraints in large-scale mapping,"Paul Amayo,Pedro Piniés,Lina M. Paz,Paul Newman,","This paper is about discovering and leveraging architectural constraints in large scale 3D reconstructions using laser. Our contribution is to offer a formulation of the problem which naturally and in a unified way, captures the variety of architectural constraints that can be discovered and applied in urban reconstructions. We focus in particular on the case of survey construction with a push broom laser + VO system. Here visual odometry is combined with vertical 2D scans to create a 3D picture of the environment. A key characteristic here is that the sensors pass/sweep swiftly through the environment such that elements of the scene are seen only briefly by cameras and scanned just once by the laser. These qualities make for a an ill-constrained optimisation problem which is greatly aided if architectural constraints can be discovered and appropriately applied. We demonstrate our approach in an end-to-end implementation which discovers salient architectural constraints and rejects false loop closures before invoking an optimisation to return a 3D model of the workspace. We evaluate the precision of this model by comparison to a ground truth provided by a 3rd party professional survey using highend (static) 3D laser scanners."
icra,None,A unified resource-constrained framework for graph SLAM,"Liam Paull,Guoquan Huang,John J. Leonard,","Graphical methods have proven an extremely useful tool employed by the mobile robotics community to frame estimation problems. Incremental solvers are able to process incoming sensor data and produce maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in realtime by exploiting the natural sparsity within the graph for reasonable-sized problems. However, to enable truly longterm operation in prior unknown environments requires algorithms whose computation, memory, and bandwidth (in the case of distributed systems) requirements scale constantly with time and environment size. Some recent approaches have addressed this problem through a two-step process - first the variables selected for removal are marginalized which induces density, and then the result is sparsified to maintain computational efficiency. Previous literature generally addresses only one of these two components. In this work, we attempt to explicitly connect all of the aforementioned resource constraint requirements by considering the node removal and sparsification pipeline in its entirety. We formulate the node selection problem as a minimization problem over the penalty to be paid in the resulting sparsification. As a result, we produce node subset selection strategies that are optimal in terms of minimizing the impact, in terms of Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD), of approximating the dense distribution by a sparse one. We then show that one instantiation of this problem yields a computationally tractable formulation. Finally, we evaluate the method on standard datasets and show that the KLD is minimized as compared to other commonly-used heuristic node selection techniques."

David Remy,","This paper uses optimal control to simultaneously optimize the motion and morphology of a realistic model of a 2D Monoped. In particular, we compare the energetics of four different actuator configurations: a parallel elastic actuator (PEA) in the hip and a series elastic actuator in the leg (SEA), series hip and parallel leg, series hip and series leg, and parallel hip and parallel leg. We use realistic models with mass in the legs and feet, damping in the springs, and detailed DC electric motor models. The comparison is carried out for the cost of transport of three energetic measures: positive motor work, electrical losses, and positive electrical work, and evaluated as a function of velocity. In our optimization we include motor parameters, stiffness, and spring pre-compression terms as free variables, ensuring that we compare the energetically optimal version of each configuration at each velocity. We show that for the positive motor work and the electrical losses costs of transport (COT), the parallel hip and series leg configuration is energetically optimal. For the electrical work, the optimal configuration is speed dependent, with series hip and parallel leg optimal at low speeds, and both series hip series leg and parallel hip series leg optimal at high speeds."
icra,None,Optimization and stabilization of trajectories for constrained dynamical systems,"Michael Posa,Scott Kuindersma,Russ Tedrake,","Contact constraints, such as those between a foot and the ground or a hand and an object, are inherent in many robotic tasks. These constraints define a manifold of feasible states; while well understood mathematically, they pose numerical challenges to many algorithms for planning and controlling whole-body dynamic motions. In this paper, we present an approach to the synthesis and stabilization of complex trajectories for both fully-actuated and underactuated robots subject to contact constraints. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm (DIRCON) that extends the direct collocation method, naturally incorporating manifold constraints to produce a nominal trajectory with third-order integration accuracy-a critical feature for achieving reliable tracking control. We adapt the classical time-varying linear quadratic regulator to produce a local cost-to-go in the manifold tangent plane. Finally, we descend the cost-to-go using a quadratic program that incorporates unilateral friction and torque constraints. This approach is demonstrated on three complex walking and climbing locomotion examples in simulation."
icra,None,Simultaneous optimization of gait and design parameters for bipedal robots,"Ulrich J. Römer,Cornelius Kuhs,Mathias J. Krause,Alexander Fidlin,","A walking bipedal robot's energy efficiency depends on its gait as well as its design, whereas design changes affect the optimal gaits. We propose a method to take these interdependencies into account via simultaneous optimization of gait as well as design parameters. The method is applied to a planar robot with hybrid zero dynamics control and a torsion spring between its thighs. Periodic gaits are simulated by means of the hybrid zero dynamics. The implementation of the simultaneous optimization of gait parameters and spring stiffness via sequential quadratic programming is presented. Subsequently, an error analysis is performed to gain good convergence and short computation times of the optimization. The evaluation of gradients is identified as crucial for the algorithm's convergence and therefore performed via complex step derivative approximations. The resulting implementation exhibits good convergence behavior and is provided as supplement to this paper. At 2.3 m/s, the simultaneous optimization results in savings in energy expenditure of up to 55%. A consecutive optimization of first gait and then stiffness yields only 11%, demonstrating the advantage of the presented method."
icra,None,Model predictive control of autonomous mobility-on-demand systems,"Rick Zhang,Federico Rossi,Marco Pavone,","In this paper we present a model predictive control (MPC) approach to optimize vehicle scheduling and routing in an autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) system. In AMoD systems, robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and are coordinated to optimize service throughout the entire network. Specifically, we first propose a novel discrete-time model of an AMoD system and we show that this formulation allows the easy integration of a number of real-world constraints, e.g., electric vehicle charging constraints. Second, leveraging our model, we design a model predictive control algorithm for the optimal coordination of an AMoD system and prove its stability in the sense of Lyapunov. At each optimization step, the vehicle scheduling and routing problem is solved as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) where the decision variables are binary variables representing whether a vehicle will 1) wait at a station, 2) service a customer, or 3) rebalance to another station. Finally, by using real-world data, we show that the MPC algorithm can be run in real-time for moderately-sized systems and outperforms previous control strategies for AMoD systems."
icra,None,Evolutionary optimization for parameterized whole-body dynamic motor skills,"Sehoon Ha,C. Karen Liu,","Learning a parameterized skill is essential for autonomous robots operating in an unpredictable environment. Previous techniques learned a policy for each example task individually and constructed a regression model to map between task and policy parameter spaces. However, these techniques have less success when applied to whole-body dynamic skills, such as jumping or walking, which involve the challenges of handling discrete contacts and balancing an under-actuated system under gravity. This paper introduces an evolutionary optimization algorithm for learning parameterized skills to achieve whole-body dynamic tasks. Our algorithm simultaneously learns policies for a range of tasks instead of learning each policy individually. The problem can be formulated as a nonconvex optimization whose solution is a closed segment of curve instead of a point in the policy parameter space. We develop a new optimization algorithm which maintains a parameterized probability distribution for the entire range of tasks and iteratively updates the distribution using selected elite samples. Our algorithm is able to better exploit each sample, greatly reducing the number of samples required to optimize a parameterized skill for all the tasks in the range of interest."

In the case of pure visual navigation, all these subtasks need to utilize the same vision system, and therefore a way to optimally control the direction of focus is needed. We present a case study, where we model the active sensing problem of directing the gaze of a mobile robot with three machine vision cameras as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) using a mutual information (MI) based reward function. The key aspect of the solution is that the cameras are dynamically used either in monocular or stereo configuration.

The algorithm is based on a stochastic optimal control framework using a fundamental relationship between the information theoretic notions of free energy and relative entropy. The optimal controls in this setting take the form of a path integral, which we approximate using an efficient importance sampling scheme. We experimentally verify the algorithm by implementing it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and apply it to the problem of controlling a fifth-scale Auto-Rally vehicle in an aggressive driving task."
icra,None,On reachability sets for optimal feedback controllers: Monitoring the approach of a region of attraction,"Christof Vömel,Diego Pardo,Jonas Buchli,","Sums-of-Squares optimization represents an important tool for the direct computation of a local Lyapunov function for a nonlinear dynamic system. Specifically, it can certify a sub-levelset of the cost-to-go from an optimal feedback controller like the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), geometrically an ellipsoid in the state space, as Region of Attraction (ROA) of the closed-loop system. More complex robotic tasks however require switching control to first take the system into the ROA before invoking the LQR stabilizer. In this paper, we propose computationally efficient measures of the ROA distance based on quadratic and conic optimization to effectively supervise such a trajectory as it approaches the ROA. As a one-dimensional condensate of the multi-dimensional state trajectory, monitoring the ROA distance evolution allows us to early detect deviations, e.g. due to input saturation or time delay, in order to quickly take corrective action such as replanning. Importantly, computing the ROA distance adds only a small overhead on top of the ROA calculation itself and can be done concurrently."
icra,None,3D dynamic walking with underactuated humanoid robots: A direct collocation framework for optimizing hybrid zero dynamics,"Ayonga Hereid,Eric A. Cousineau,Christian M. Hubicki,Aaron D. Ames,","Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for dynamic and underactuated bipedal walking, but has significant implementation difficulties when applied to the high degrees of freedom present in humanoid robots. The primary impediment is the process of gait design-it is difficult for optimizers to converge on a viable set of virtual constraints defining a gait. This paper presents a methodology that allows for the fast and reliable generation of efficient multi-contact robotic walking gaits through the framework of HZD, even in the presence of underactuation. To achieve this goal, we unify methods from trajectory optimization with the control framework of multi-domain hybrid zero dynamics. By formulating a novel optimization problem in the context of direct collocation and generating analytic Jacobians for the constraints, solving the resulting nonlinear program becomes tractable for large-scale nonlinear programming solvers, even for systems as high-dimensional as humanoid robots. We experimentally validated our methodology on the spring-legged prototype humanoid, DURUS, showing that the optimization approach yields dynamic and stable 3D walking gaits."

Kochenderfer,Marco Pavone,","Safely integrating unmanned aerial vehicles into civil airspace is contingent upon development of a trustworthy collision avoidance system. This paper proposes an approach whereby a parameterized resolution logic that is considered trusted for a given range of its parameters is adaptively tuned online. Specifically, to address the potential conservatism of the resolution logic with static parameters, we present a dynamic programming approach for adapting the parameters dynamically based on the encounter state. We compute the adaptation policy offline using a simulation-based approximate dynamic programming method that accommodates the high dimensionality of the problem. Numerical experiments show that this approach improves safety and operational performance compared to the baseline resolution logic, while retaining trustworthiness."
icra,None,"Receding Horizon ""Next-Best-View"" Planner for 3D Exploration","Andreas Bircher,Mina Kamel,Kostas Alexis,Helen Oleynikova,Roland Siegwart,","This paper presents a novel path planning algorithm for the autonomous exploration of unknown space using aerial robotic platforms. The proposed planner employs a receding horizon “next-best-view” scheme: In an online computed random tree it finds the best branch, the quality of which is determined by the amount of unmapped space that can be explored. Only the first edge of this branch is executed at every planning step, while repetition of this procedure leads to complete exploration results. The proposed planner is capable of running online, onboard a robot with limited resources. Its high performance is evaluated in detailed simulation studies as well as in a challenging real world experiment using a rotorcraft micro aerial vehicle. Analysis on the computational complexity of the algorithm is provided and its good scaling properties enable the handling of large scale and complex problem setups."
icra,None,Aggressive quadrotor flight through cluttered environments using mixed integer programming,"Benoit Landry,Robin Deits,Peter R. Florence,Russ Tedrake,","Quadrotor flight has typically been limited to sparse environments due to numerical complications that arise when dealing with large numbers of obstacles. We hypothesized that it would be possible to plan and robustly execute trajectories in obstacle-dense environments using the novel Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite programming algorithm (IRIS), mixed-integer semidefinite programs (MISDP), and model-based control. Unlike sampling-based approaches, the planning algorithm first introduced by Deits theoretically guarantees non-penetration of the trajectories even with small obstacles such as strings. We present experimental validation of this claim by aggressively flying a small quadrotor (34g, 92mm rotor to rotor) in a series of indoor environments including a cubic meter volume containing 20 interwoven strings, and present the control architecture we developed to do so."
icra,None,Online generation of collision-free trajectories for quadrotor flight in unknown cluttered environments,"Jing Chen,Tianbo Liu,Shaojie Shen,","We present an online method for generating collision-free trajectories for autonomous quadrotor flight through cluttered environments. We consider the real-world scenario that the quadrotor aerial robot is equipped with limited sensing and operates in initially unknown environments. During flight, an octree-based environment representation is incrementally built using onboard sensors. Utilizing efficient operations in the octree data structure, we are able to generate free-space flight corridors consisting of large overlapping 3-D grids in an online fashion. A novel optimization-based method then generates smooth trajectories that both are bounded entirely within the safe flight corridor and satisfy higher order dynamical constraints. Our method computes valid trajectories within fractions of a second on a moderately fast computer, thus permitting online re-generation of trajectories for reaction to new obstacles. We build a complete quadrotor testbed with onboard sensing, state estimation, mapping, and control, and integrate the proposed method to show online navigation through complex unknown environments."
icra,None,High speed navigation for quadrotors with limited onboard sensing,"Sikang Liu,Michael Watterson,Sarah Tang,Vijay Kumar,","We address the problem of high speed autonomous navigation of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles with limited onboard sensing and computation. In particular, we propose a dual range planning horizon method to safely and quickly navigate quadrotors to specified goal locations in previously unknown and unstructured environments. In each planning epoch, a short-range planner uses a local map to generate a new trajectory. At the same time, a safe stopping policy is found. This allows the robot to come to an emergency halt when necessary. Our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance and demonstrates important advances in real-time planning. First, our novel short range planning method allows us to generate and re-plan trajectories that are dynamically feasible, comply with state and input constraints, and avoid obstacles in real-time. Further, previous planning algorithms abstract away the obstacle detection problem by assuming the instantaneous availability of geometric information about the environment. In contrast, our method addresses the challenge of using the raw sensor data to form a map and navigate in real-time. Finally, in addition to simulation examples, we provide physical experiments that demonstrate the entire algorithmic pipeline from obstacle detection to trajectory execution."
icra,None,Minimum-energy path generation for a quadrotor UAV,"Fabio Morbidi,Roel Cano,David Lara,","A major limitation of existing battery-powered quadrotor UAVs is their reduced flight endurance. To address this issue, by leveraging the electrical model of a brushless DC motor, we explicitly determine minimum-energy paths between a predefined initial and final configuration of a quadrotor by solving an optimal control problem with respect to the angular accelerations of the four propellers. As a variation on this problem, if the total energy consumption between two boundary states is fixed, minimum-time and/or minimum-control-effort trajectories are computed for the aerial vehicle. The theory is illustrated for the DJI Phantom 2 quadrotor in three realistic scenarios."
icra,None,Aggressive quadrotor flight using dense visual-inertial fusion,"Yonggen Ling,Tianbo Liu,Shaojie Shen,","In this work, we address the problem of aggressive flight of a quadrotor aerial vehicle using cameras and IMUs as the only sensing modalities. We present a fully integrated quadrotor system and demonstrate through online experiment the capability of autonomous flight with linear velocities up to 4.2 m/s, linear accelerations up to 9.6 m/s2, and angular velocities up to 245.1 degree/s. Central to our approach is a dense visual-inertial state estimator for reliable tracking of aggressive motions. An uncertainty-aware direct dense visual tracking module provides camera pose tracking that takes inverse depth uncertainty into account and is resistant to motion blur. Measurements from IMU pre-integration and multi-constrained dense visual tracking are fused probabilistically using an optimization-based sensor fusion framework. Extensive statistical analysis and comparison are presented to verify the performance of the proposed approach. We also release our code as open-source ROS packages."
icra,None,An analysis of wind field estimation and exploitation for quadrotor flight in the urban canopy layer,"John Ware,Nicholas Roy,","Although unmanned air vehicles' increasing agility and autonomy may soon allow for flight in urban environments, the impact of complex urban wind fields on vehicle flight performance remains unclear. Unlike synoptic winds at high altitudes, urban wind fields are subject to turbulence generated by the buildings and terrain. The resulting spatial and temporal variation makes inference about the global wind field based on local wind measurements difficult and prevents the use of most simple wind models. Fortunately, the structure of the urban environment provides exploitable predictability given a suitable computational fluid dynamics solver, a representative 3D model of the environment, and an estimate of the expected prevailing wind speed and heading. The prevailing wind speed and direction at altitude and computational fluid dynamics solver can generate the corresponding wind field estimate over the map. By generating wind fields in this way, this work investigates a quadrotor's ability to exploit them for improved flight performance. Along with the wind field estimate, an empirically derived power consumption model is used to find minimum-energy trajectories with a planner both aware of and naive to the wind field. When compared to minimum-energy trajectories that do not incorporate wind conditions, the wind-aware trajectories demonstrate reduced flight times, total energy expenditures, and failures due to excess air speed for trajectories across MIT campus."
icra,None,Fast radiation mapping and multiple source localization using topographic contour map and incremental density estimation,"Abdullah Al Redwan Newaz,Sungmoon Jeong,Hosun Lee,Hyejeong Ryu,,,","Toward a global picture of the radiation exposure of an area, particularly for fast emergency response, a UAV based exploration method is proposed. Without a priori knowledge of the radiation field, it is difficult to select the region of interest (ROI) which includes all radiation sources. For the case of a single radiation source, a greedy algorithm may localize the source by finding the maximum radiation value. However, when multiple sources generate a hotspot in a cumulative manner, the hotspot position does not coincide with one of the source positions. Therefore, we propose an efficient exploration method to quickly localize the radiation sources using the following procedures: (1) ROI selection using topographic maps with specific radiation level selection methods and (2) source localization estimating the number of sources and their positions with incremental variational Bayes inference of Gaussian mixtures. Under three different conditions according to the number of sources and their positions, we have shown that the proposed model can reduce the ROI and significantly improve the estimation accuracy than existing methods."
icra,None,Informative soaring with drifting thermals,"Joseph L. Nguyen,Nicholas R. J. Lawrance,Robert Fitch,Salah Sukkarieh,","The informative soaring (IFS) problem involves a gliding unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) exploiting energy from thermals to extend its information gathering capability. In this paper, we address the realistic situation of detecting new thermals drifting with the wind in the search environment. We consider complex target-search scenarios characterised by information clusters and propose a new set of algorithms designed to both explore for and exploit high-value thermals to maximise information gain. Our algorithms: 1) compute a thermal exploration map to detect useful thermals that eventually intercept clusters, 2) solve a boundary value problem for inter-thermal path segment (ITP) generation with moving thermals, 3) compute thermal time windows to gather information from clusters and form a cluster service schedule, and 4) use branch and bound (BnB) tree search for global planning, considering high-utility-rate ITPs to maximise information gain. Our solution is compared against a greedy method that neither considers the thermal exploration map nor cluster schedule and a full knowledge method that has access to all thermals. Numerical simulations show that on average, our solution outperforms the greedy method in one-third of 2400 Monte Carlo trials, and achieves similar performance to the full knowledge method when environmental conditions are favourable."
icra,None,"Fast, on-board, model-aided visual-inertial odometry system for quadrotor micro aerial vehicles","Dinuka Abeywardena,Shoudong Huang,Ben Barnes,Gamini Dissanayake,,","The main contribution of this paper is a high frequency, low-complexity, on-board visual-inertial odometry system for quadrotor micro air vehicles. The system consists of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimation algorithm that fuses information from a low cost MEMS inertial measurement unit acquired at 200Hz and VGA resolution images from a monocular camera at 50Hz. The dynamic model describing the quadrotor motion is employed in the estimation algorithm as a third source of information. Visual information is incorporated into the EKF by enforcing the epipolar constraint on features tracked between image pairs, avoiding the need to explicitly estimate the location of the tracked environmental features. Combined use of the dynamic model and epipolar constraints makes it possible to obtain drift free velocity and attitude estimates in the presence of both accelerometer and gyroscope biases. A strategy to deal with the unobservability that arises when the quadrotor is in hover is also provided. Experimental data from a real-time implementation of the system on a 50 gram embedded computer are presented in addition to the simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system."
icra,None,Velocity aided attitude estimation for aerial robotic vehicles using latent rotation scaling,"Guillaume Allibert,Robert Mahony,Moses Bangura,","Flight performance of aerial robotic vehicles is critically dependent on the quality of the state estimates provided by onboard sensor systems. The attitude estimation problem has been extensively studied over the last ten years and the development of low complexity, high performance, robust non-linear observers for attitude has been one of the enabling technologies fueling the growth of small scale aerial robotic systems. The velocity aided attitude estimation problem, that is simultaneous estimation of attitude and linear velocity of an aerial platform, has only been tackled using the non-linear observer approach in the last few years. Prior contributions have lead to non-linear observers for which either there is no stability analysis or for which the analysis is extremely complex. In this paper, we propose a simple relaxation of the state space, allowing scaled rotation matrices R ∈ ℝ 3×3 such that RX T = uI where X = uR̂ and u > 0 is a positive scalar, along with additional observer dynamics to force u → 1 asymptotically. With this simple augmentation of the observer state space, we propose a non-linear observer with a straightforward Lyapunov stability analysis that demonstrates almost global asymptotic convergence along with local exponential convergence. Simulations as well as experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed observer."
icra,None,Visual inertial odometry for quadrotors on SE(3),"Giuseppe Loianno,Michael Watterson,Vijay Kumar,","The combination of on-board sensors measurements with different statistical characteristics can be employed in robotics for localization and control, especially in GPS-denied environments. In particular, most aerial vehicles are packaged with low cost sensors, important for aerial robotics, such as camera, a gyroscope, and an accelerometer. In this work, we develop a visual inertial odometry system based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) acting on the Lie group SE(3), such to obtain an unique, singularity-free representation of a rigid body pose. We model this pose with the Lie group SE(3) and model the noise on the corresponding Lie algebra. Moreover, we extend the concepts used in the standard UKF formulation, such as state uncertainty and modeling, to correctly incorporate elements that do not belong to an Euclidean space such as the Lie group members. In this analysis, we use the parallel transport, which requires us to explicitly consider SE(3) as representing rigid bodies though the use of the affine connection. We present experimental results to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for state estimation of a quadrotor platform."
icra,None,Work those arms: Toward dynamic and stable humanoid walking that optimizes full-body motion,"Christian M. Hubicki,Ayonga Hereid,Michael X. Grey,Andrea L. Thomaz,,","Humanoid robots are designed with dozens of actuated joints to suit a variety of tasks, but walking controllers rarely make the best use of all of this freedom. We present a framework for maximizing the use of the full humanoid body for the purpose of stable dynamic locomotion, which requires no restriction to a planning template (e.g. LIPM). Using a hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) framework, this approach optimizes a set of outputs which provides requirements for the motion for all actuated links, including arms. These output equations are then rapidly solved by a whole-body inverse-kinematic (IK) solver, providing a set of joint trajectories to the robot. We apply this procedure to a simulation of the humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO, which has over 27 actuators. As a consequence, the resulting gaits swing their arms, not by a user defining swinging motions a priori or superimposing them on gaits post hoc, but as an emergent behavior from optimizing the dynamic gait. We also present preliminary dynamic walking experiments with DRC-HUBO in hardware, thereby building a case that hybrid zero dynamics as augmented by inverse kinematics (HZD+IK) is becoming a viable approach for controlling the full complexity of humanoid locomotion."

Our method is based on efficient simulation of rigid multibody systems and a direct multiple-shooting method to solve the underlying space-time optimization problem. We formulated different optimization criteria and synthesized gaits for a fullbody 3-D human model with 34 degrees of freedom and compared the resulting movements with human data. By combining different criteria we are able to improve the similarity of the synthesized motions with respect to recorded human motioncapture motions.
icra,None,Off-line controller design for reliable walking of ranger,"Matthew Kelly,Matthew Sheen,Andy Ruina,","We present a method for designing a walking controller for the walking robot Cornell Ranger. Our goal is a controller that can be designed using model-based optimization, and then transferred directly to the robot without the need for after-the-fact hand-tuning. The structure of the controller is hierarchical, with a high-level balance controller that plans step-to-step motions, and a lower-level joint controller that coordinates the individual joint motors to achieve the desired limb motions. The balance controller is designed through optimization, with the explicit goals of a) achieving a desired walking speed while b) minimizing energy use and c) avoiding falls due to disturbances. We demonstrate this walking controller on the Cornell Ranger, and find that the resulting gait is comparable to that of a previous (hand-tuned) controller, with regard to energy use, speed regulation, and fall prevention."

A particular use case is a humanoid robot helping a human to carry large and/or heavy objects. To do this, we construct a reduced model which takes into account physical interaction. This is used in a model predictive control framework to generate separate behaviors for being a follower or a leader. The approach is then validated both on simulation and on the HRP-4 humanoid robot."
icra,None,Focused online visual-motor coordination for a dual-arm robot manipulator,"Seongyong Koo,Sven Behnke,","Coordination between visual sensors and robot manipulators is necessary for successful manipulation. This paper proposes a novel visual-motor coordination method that performs online parameter estimation of an RGB-D camera mounted in a robot head without any external markers. Through self-observation of a dual-arm robot manipulator, the method updates parameters to reduce the discrepancy between observed point cloud data and 3D mesh models of the current robot con guration. With the estimated parameters at each time step, visual data is adjusted to the focused workspace of the 14DOF dual-arm robot manipulator. The online and realtime algorithm was developed by using a GPU-based particle filtering method. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art offline registration methods in terms of accuracy and computation time. We also analyzed the dependence of the results on prior parameters to demonstrate the online capability of our method."

By using the concept of Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) first in introduced in [1], the present paper permits operator and robot balance synchronization using the mutual dynamics of the Center of Mass (CoM) and Center of Pressure (CoP). The Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) with a reaction mass [2] is utilized to capture the humanoid behavior which interacts with the human operator under the Equilibrium Point (EP) [3] control assumption. Remarkable similarities between the physical system behavior and simulated results suggest the feasibility of the strategy. Experiments conducted with the MIT HERMES humanoid robot further show the performance of the proposed method."
icra,None,Fast algorithms to test robust static equilibrium for legged robots,"Andrea Del Prete,Steve Tonneau,Nicolas Mansard,","Maintaining equilibrium is of primary importance for legged systems. It is not surprising then that static equilibrium is at the core of most control/planning algorithms for legged robots. Being able to check whether a system is in static equilibrium is thus important, and doing it efficiently is crucial. While this is straightforward for a system in contact with a flat ground only, it is not the case for arbitrary contact geometries. In this paper we propose two new techniques to test static equilibrium and we show that they are computationally faster than all other existing methods. Moreover, we address the issue of robustness to errors in the contact-force tracking, which could lead to slippage or rotation at the contacts. We extend all the discussed techniques to test for robust static equilibrium, that is the ability to maintain equilibrium while avoiding to lose contacts despite bounded force-tracking errors. Accounting for robustness does not affect the computation time of the equilibrium tests, while it qualitatively improves the contact postures generated by our reachability-based multicontact planner."

We use a tailored ray-casting algorithm to associate a point of the surface to each point of the sphere. This allows us to have smooth approximate representations for a large variety of (possibly non-convex) meshes that we can use to write numerically well-behaved constraints in gradient-based optimization. In particular, we address the writing of contact constraints between a robot and objects of its environment. We first detail our algorithm, taking care of speed and robustness, then show several use-cases for posture generations with a humanoid robot or a hand."

The assigned task trajectory is deformable, and the planner may exploit this feature for finding a solution. Our framework consists of two main components: a constrained motion planner and a deformation mechanism. The basic idea is that the constrained motion planner attempts to solve the problem for the original task. If this proves to be too difficult, the deformation mechanism modifies the task using appropriate heuristic functions. Then, the constrained motion planner is invoked again on the deformed task. If needed, this procedure is iterated. The proposed algorithm has been successfully implemented for the NAO humanoid in V-REP."
icra,None,NEOL: Toward Never-Ending Object Learning for robots,"Yuyin Sun,Dieter Fox,","Learning to recognize objects based on names is a crucial capability for personal robots. Recent recognition methods successfully learn to recognize objects in a train-once-then-test setting. Yet, these methods do not apply readily to robotic settings, where a robot might continuously encounter new objects and new names. In this work, we present a framework for Never-Ending Object Learning (NEOL). Our framework automatically learns to organize object names into a semantic hierarchy using crowdsourcing and background knowledge bases. It then uses the hierarchy to improve the consistency and efficiency of annotating objects. It also adapts information from additional image datasets to learn object classifiers from a very small number of training examples. We present experiments to test the performance of the adaptation method and demonstrate the full system in a never-ending object learning experiment."

We use depth information mainly for privacy protection, and then focus on the motion analysis of informative body parts, since most activities are much associated with these particular parts, e.g., head and hands in upper body. Based on the idea, we propose two novel features with intuitive physical meaning, which are Histogram of Located Displacements (HOLD) and Local Depth Motion Maps (L-DMM) based Gabor representation. They can capture discriminative posture and motion cues from skeletal joints and depth data respectively. Combing the advantages of joint and depth features as well as emphasizing the reliable parts can enhance the robustness of classification ability. The experimental results show that our proposed feature representation is very discriminative for the task of daily activity recognition and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods."

Oliveira,Abhinav Valada,Claas Bollen,Wolfram Burgard,,","This paper addresses the problem of human body part segmentation in conventional RGB images, which has several applications in robotics, such as learning from demonstration and human-robot handovers. The proposed solution is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We present a network architecture that assigns each pixel to one of a predefined set of human body part classes, such as head, torso, arms, legs. After initializing weights with a very deep convolutional network for image classification, the network can be trained end-to-end and yields precise class predictions at the original input resolution. Our architecture particularly improves on over-fitting issues in the up-convolutional part of the network. Relying only on RGB rather than RGB-D images also allows us to apply the approach outdoors. The network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL Parts dataset. Moreover, we introduce two new part segmentation datasets, the Freiburg sitting people dataset and the Freiburg people in disaster dataset. We also present results obtained with a ground robot and an unmanned aerial vehicle."
icra,None,Learning convolutional action primitives for fine-grained action recognition,"Colin Lea,René Vidal,Gregory D. Hager,","Fine-grained action recognition is important for many applications of human-robot interaction, automated skill assessment, and surveillance. The goal is to segment and classify all actions occurring in a time series sequence. While recent recognition methods have shown strong performance in robotics applications, they often require hand-crafted features, use large amounts of domain knowledge, or employ overly simplistic representations of how objects change throughout an action. In this paper we present the Latent Convolutional Skip Chain Conditional Random Field (LC-SC-CRF). This time series model learns a set of interpretable and composable action primitives from sensor data. We apply our model to cooking tasks using accelerometer data from the University of Dundee 50 Salads dataset and to robotic surgery training tasks using robot kinematic data from the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). Our performance on 50 Salads and JIGSAWS are 18.0% and 5.3% higher than the state of the art, respectively. This model performs well without requiring hand-crafted features or intricate domain knowledge. The code and features have been made public."
icra,None,Robust speech/non-speech discrimination based on pitch estimation for mobile robots,"François Grondin,François Michaud,","To be used on a mobile robot, speech/non-speech discrimination must be robust to environmental noise and to the position of the interlocutor, without necessarily having to satisfy low-latency requirements. To address these conditions, this paper presents a speech/non-speech discrimination approach based on pitch estimation. Pitch features are robust to noise and reverberation, and can be estimated over a few seconds. Results suggest that our approach is more robust compared to the use of Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients with Gaussian Mixture Models (MFCC-GMM) under high reverberation levels and additive noise (with an accuracy above 98% with a latency of 2.21 sec), which makes it ideal for mobile robot applications. The approach is also validated on a mobile robot equipped with a 8-microphone array, using speech/non-speech discrimination based on pitch estimation as a post-processing module of a localization, tracking and separation system."

We investigate a multi-sensorial approach, making no assumptions about the garments' configuration or properties. We use a robot equipped with RGB-D, tactile, and photometric stereo sensors that interacts with the garment through a combination of different basic actions. By applying machine learning techniques on the autonomously acquired data of different modalities we recognize the manipulated garment's type, fabric pattern, and material.

We present a novel approach that utilizes labeled RGB-D data in the training stage, where depth features are extracted for enhancing the discriminative capability of the original learning system that only relies on RGB images. The highly dissimilar source and target domain data are mapped into a unified feature space through transfer at both feature and classifier levels. In order to alleviate cross-domain discrepancy, we employ a state-of-the-art domain-adaptive dictionary learning algorithm that updates image representations in both domains and the classifier parameters simultaneously. The proposed method is trained on a RGB-D Object dataset and evaluated on the Caltech-256 dataset. Experimental results suggest that our approach can lead to significant performance gain over the state-of-the-art methods."

Traditional recognition algorithms usually require the knowledge of view angle, which is not always available in robotic applications such as active vision. In this paper, we propose a new framework to recognize actions with arbitrary views. A main feature of our algorithm is that view-invariance is learned from synthetic 2D and 3D training data using transfer dictionary learning. This guarantees the availability of training data, and removes the hassle of obtaining real world video in specific viewing angles. The result of the process is a dictionary that can project real world 2D video into a view-invariant sparse representation. This facilitates the training of a view-invariant classifier. Experimental results on the IXMAS and N-UCLA datasets show significant improvements over existing algorithms."

Zaki,Faisal Shafait,Ajmal Mian,","Deep learning based methods have achieved unprecedented success in solving several computer vision problems involving RGB images. However, this level of success is yet to be seen on RGB-D images owing to two major challenges in this domain: training data deficiency and multi-modality input dissimilarity. We present an RGB-D object recognition framework that addresses these two key challenges by effectively embedding depth and point cloud data into the RGB domain. We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on RGB data as a feature extractor for both color and depth channels and propose a rich coarse-to-fine feature representation scheme, coined Hypercube Pyramid, that is able to capture discriminatory information at different levels of detail. Finally, we present a novel fusion scheme to combine the Hypercube Pyramid features with the activations of fully connected neurons to construct a compact representation prior to classification. By employing Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) as non-linear classifiers, we show that the proposed method outperforms ten state-of-the-art algorithms for several tasks in terms of recognition accuracy on the benchmark Washington RGB-D and 2D3D object datasets by a large margin (upto 50% reduction in error rate)."

More specifically, we investigate microstructure transport caused by stochastic collisions between freely swimming cells and rigid microstructure boundaries in a dense bacterial bath. We characterize the motion of asymmetrically shaped microstructures, specifically gears and chevrons, and demonstrate control of these microrobots by altering the motility of swimming cells with high intensity blue light. We demonstrate both rotational and translational motion control using a custom system for tracking and real-time automated exposure of local bath regions using visual feedback. These experiments are supported by a mathematical model and simulations which describe the dynamics of a microstructure propelled by many stochastic cell structure collisions.

In this paper, to improve the consistency of inertial focusing experiments, we apply feedback control to inertial focusing devices. The feedback control was realized by an image processing algorithm for real-time measurement of equilibrium positions using a high-speed vision system. The proposed image processing algorithm and feedback control scheme were verified through experiments."
icra,None,A fully automated robotic system for three-dimensional cell rotation,"Zenan Wang,Chen Feng,Ramadass Muruganandam,Joyce Mathew,,,,,","Injection and extraction of materials (e.g. protein, sperms, DNA, and blastomeres) into and from cells are essential operation for In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In order to perform the injection and extraction without damage to the cell, the cell needs to be at an optimal orientation. In this paper, a fully automated microrobotic system for cell orientation is presented. The proposed system overcomes several inherent problems in manual cell manipulation, including low efficiency, inconsistent output and poor success rate. The system can rotate a single fish embryo to a desired orientation by employing motion control, fluidic flow control, and computer vision. It is evaluated by using 60 Zebrafish embryos. Experimental results show that the system is capable of performing fast embryo orientation at a speed of 13 s/cell with a high success rate of 97.5% and a high in-plane rotation precision of 0.5°."

The system includes three main operations, and they are the operations of catch, load and launch. In the catch operation, the system is capable of capturing a target cell by high-speed vision and high-frequency flow control. The captured cell is pushed into a narrow constriction for the load operation. Different durations of loading time are applied to cells for evaluating cell viscoelasticity. Finally, the cell is launched out from the constriction, and the recovery response of the cell is monitored for cell characterization. Human red blood cells are experimentally tested by the proposed system. The experimental results show that the system successfully perform the evaluation, and the viscoelastic characteristics of the cells are discussed."

The folding conditions are analyzed to develop an optimal strategy for producing desired three-dimensional shapes. We present two different methods for programming magnetization in these microrobots that are variant and invariant to folding. The microrobots can be navigated through user-defined trajectories using rotating magnetic fields, and the morphing in response to temperature changes can be tuned for adaptive behavior. On-demand modulation of the mobility of individual microrobots is demonstrated by morphing their shape using selective near infrared light (NIR) exposure."
icra,None,Closed-loop 3D path following of scaled-up helical microswimmers,"Ali Oulmas,Nicolas Andreff,Stéphane Régnier,","This paper addresses the problem of 3D path following of magnetic helical microswimmers in closed-loop. An error kinematic model in a local frame with sideslip and attack angles is used to express the motion of the helical microswimmer. A new derivation of the chained form with three inputs and five states is used to linearize the kinematic model in order to design a decoupled stable control. In experimentation, the 3D path following is validated using a scaled-up magnetic helical microswimmer with visual servo control by following first a spatial straight line, then a helix trajectory and finally an inclined sinusoidal trajectory. The closed-loop control is also compared with the open-loop control to illustrate the robustness and the accuracy of both controllers to the disturbances."
icra,None,Five-degree-of-freedom magnetic control of micro-robots using rotating permanent magnets,"Patrick Ryan,Eric Diller,","Recent work in magnetically-actuated micro-scale robots for biomedical or microfluidic applications has resulted in electromagnetic actuation systems which can command precise five-degree-of-freedom control of simple magnetic devices at the sub-millimeter scale in remote environments. This paper presents a new type of actuation system which uses an array of large, rotatable, permanent magnets to generate the same level of control over untethered micro-robotic systems with the potential for increased field and gradient strength and minimal heat generation. We show that the system can produce any field or field gradient at the workspace (including a value of zero). In contrast with previous permanent magnet actuation systems, the system proposed here accomplishes this without any hazardous translational motion of the control magnets, resulting in a simple, safe, and inexpensive system. The proof-of-concept prototype system presented, with eight permanent magnets, can create fields and gradients in any direction with strength of 30 mT and 0.83 T·m-1, respectively. The effectiveness of the system is shown through characterization and feedback control of a 250 μm micro-magnet in a path-following task with average accuracy of 39 μm."
icra,None,Development of a 3D-magnetic tweezer system having magnetic pole positioning mechanism,"Daisuke Matsuura,Hitoshi Aoki,Yukio Takeda,","This paper discusses the design and implementation of a three dimensional magnetic tweezer system to achieve measurement of mechanical properties of living cells by touching a magnetically levitated micro probe to specimen cells. The system consists of a three dimensional magnetic tweezer, an inverted optical microscope for 3D probe position measurement, and control/interface software. For reducing assembly error in the magnetic tweezer and accurate adjustment of the gap distance between sextuple magnetic poles that are sharpen-tipped permalloy rods having a driving coil on each, a pole positioning mechanism was implemented in the magnetic tweezer. Finally, two experiments were performed on the fabricated prototype: trajectory tracking in which a magnetic particle of 4.5μm diameter floating in medium was steered to follow target trajectories, and homogeneity evaluation that compared force generation from each magnetic pole."
icra,None,Humanoid walking with compliant soles using a deformation estimator,"Giovanni De Magistris,Adrien Pajon,Sylvain Miossec,Abderrahmane Kheddar,","We study the effect of soft (i.e. compliant) soles in humanoid walking. Adding compliance at the foot sole is important for shock absorption during touchdown and to better cast the ground roughness. But, subsequent deformation needs to be considered in the attitude stabilization. We propose a sole deformation estimator used in the controller design, to ensure that the desired ZMP for stability requirement is fulfilled. We performed two comparison experiments on the HRP-4 humanoid robot with/without the estimator. Experiments showed how the estimator enhances the ZMP stabilization during walking and prevents the robot from falling down."
icra,None,Model predictive control for dynamic footstep adjustment using the divergent component of motion,"Robert J. Griffin,Alexander Leonessa,","This paper presents an extension of previous model predictive control (MPC) schemes to the stabilization of the time-varying divergent component of motion (DCM). To address the control authority limitations caused by fixed footholds, the step positions and rotations are treated as control inputs, allowing the generation and execution of stable walking motions, both at high speeds and in the face of disturbances. Rotation approximations are handled by applying a mixed-integer program, which, when combined with the use of the time-varying DCM to account for the effects of height changes, improve the versatility of MPC. Simulation results of fast walking and step recovery with the ESCHER humanoid demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach."
icra,None,Unified bipedal gait for walking and running by dynamics-based virtual holonomic constraint in PDAC,"Taisuke Kobayashi,Yasuhisa Hasegawa,Kosuke Sekiyama,Tadayoshi Aoyama,,","Conventional humanoids have achieved walking and running by independent controllers, even though a transition between these independent motions should be added to connect them while ensuring stability. In contrast, human selects walking/running at low/high speed in terms of energy efficiency, and transits between them naturally. This fact implies that human gait shares the inherent controller among walking and running despite their quite different appearances. Hence, we propose a “unified bipedal gait,” which includes walking, running, and the transition. The unified bipedal gait has the inherent controller: passive dynamic autonomous control (PDAC) with a damping and spring loaded inverted pendulum (D-SLIP) model. The PDAC constrains the humanoid natural dynamics by a virtual holonomic constraint (VHC) that degenerates the natural manifold of the states for stabilization. Compliance in the D-SLIP is capable to yield the required characteristics of walking/running: low/high compliant legs for walking/running. Thus, a novel VHC is designed to extract the required characteristics of walking/running from the D-SLIP dynamics and form the proper manifold. As a result, we achieved the unified bipedal gait that bifurcates to walking and running via the natural transition. The high energy efficiency was confirmed in this unified bipedal gait at any gait speed."
icra,None,Looking for motor synergies in Darwin-OP biped robot,"Tomás Cunha,Pedro M Vieira,Kevin Costa,Cristina P Santos,","In humans, the system that controls several biomechanical tasks has a modular organization (muscle synergies). While the muscle synergies in human walking were already studied deeply, this phenomenon in robotic system is not so explored and could bring simpler controllers requiring a minor number of parameters. So, the purpose of this work is to acquire and interpret synergies from selected joint signals in order to answer some specific research questions regarding the verification of synergistic control of a biped robot in a walking activity, e.g, the number of synergies, their activation profiles, their mechanical role, their quality to reproduce/control walking motions, etc. The selected robotic system was the Darwin-OP robot when walking both with a model based and a bio-inspired controller. Tests were performed with the simulated and real robot. The results appear to suggest that the extraction of synergies are quite useful for the robotic locomotion, since with only 2 synergies, is possible to reconstruct the signals of the studied joints. The biomechanical role for each determined synergy is described based on the functional transformation between sensorimotor signals and biomechanical output. Besides, the robustness of the determined synergies is verified in the locomotor activation pattern across strides and across speeds when the mechanical requirements do not change to a large extent."
icra,None,Real-time footstep planning using a geometric approach,"Philipp Karkowski,Maren Bennewitz,","To this date, many footstep planning systems rely on external sensors for mapping and traversability analysis or on computationally expensive algorithms that do not allow for real-time calculations. In this paper, we present an approach that analyzes the environment in the vicinity of the robot with an onboard RGBD camera while computing local footstep plans in real time. We achieve this by combining the advantages of grid-based height maps, fast planar region segmentation, and a systematic local footstep search to a local goal point. Using a single CPU core, a full mapping and planning cycle only takes 18 ms on average and thus presents an important step to autonomous humanoid robots in dynamic environments that only rely on their onboard hardware."
icra,None,Bipedal gait recharacterization and walking encoding generalization for stable dynamic walking,"Yan Gu,Bin Yao,C. S. George Lee,","In this paper, we propose to achieve exponentially stable periodic bipedal walking based on recharacterization of bipedal gait and generalization of walking encoding. To conveniently define an asymmetric walking pattern, a gait is characterized here in terms of the left and the right legs instead of the support and the swing legs. Another benefit of this characterization is that the joint positions become well-defined and continuous throughout a walking process even under impulse effects caused by impacts. A more general walking encoding method is then introduced, which not only includes walking pattern encoding but also enables upper-level task planning and control. Walking dynamics is then rewritten with the roles of the left and the right legs differentiated and with the biped's global position included. The desired walking pattern, as well as the desired global motion, is tracked exponentially fast through a controller designed using the output feedback linearization method. Stability of the hybrid dynamical control system is analyzed based on the construction of multiple Lyapunov functions. Finally, a fully actuated compass-gait biped is simulated to show that the proposed framework can realize exponentially stable walking, both symmetric and asymmetric, while satisfactorily tracking the desired walking pattern and the planned global motion."
icra,None,Realizing dynamic and efficient bipedal locomotion on the humanoid robot DURUS,"Jacob Reher,Eric A. Cousineau,Ayonga Hereid,Christian M. Hubicki,,","This paper presents the methodology used to achieve efficient and dynamic walking behaviors on the prototype humanoid robotics platform, DURUS. As a means of providing a hardware platform capable of these behaviors, the design of DURUS combines highly efficient electromechanical components with “control in the loop” design of the leg morphology. Utilizing the final design of DURUS, a formal framework for the generation of dynamic walking gaits which maximizes efficiency by exploiting the full body dynamics of the robot, including the interplay between the passive and active elements, is developed. The gaits generated through this methodology form the basis of the control implementation experimentally realized on DURUS; in particular, the trajectories generated through the formal framework yield a feedforward control input which is modulated by feedback in the form of regulators that compensate for discrepancies between the model and physical system. The end result of the unified approach to control-informed mechanical design, formal gait design and regulator-based feedback control implementation is efficient and dynamic locomotion on the humanoid robot DURUS. In particular, DURUS was able to demonstrate dynamic locomotion at the DRC Finals Endurance Test, walking for just under five hours in a single day, traveling 3.9 km with a mean cost of transport of 1.61-the lowest reported cost of transport achieved on a bipedal humanoid robot."

For humanoid robots, it is very prone to integration errors, due to mechanical complexity, uncertainties and foot/ground contacts. Most of the time, a visual odometry is then used to encompass these problems. In this work we propose a method to compensate for odometry drifting using machine learning on a small size low-cost humanoid without vision. This method is tested on different ground conditions and exhibits a significant improvement in odometry accuracy."

This work presents the design and development of the lower body of the new high performance humanoid WALK-MAN, a robot developed recently to assist in disaster response scenarios. The paper introduces the details of the WALK-MAN lower-body, highlighting the innovative design optimization features considered to maximize the leg performance. Starting from the general lower body specifications the objectives of the design and how they were addressed are introduced, including the selection of the leg kinematics, the arrangement of the actuators and their integration with the leg structure to maximize the range of motion, reduce the leg mass and inertia, and shape the leg mass distribution for better dynamic performance. Physical robustness is ensured with the integration of elastic transmission and impact energy absorbing covers. Experimental walking trials demonstrate the correct operation of the legs while executing a walking gait."
icra,None,Inertial sensor-based humanoid joint state estimation,"Nicholas Rotella,Sean Mason,Stefan Schaal,Ludovic Righetti,","This work presents methods for the determination of a humanoid robot's joint velocities and accelerations directly from link-mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) each containing a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. No information about the global pose of the floating base or its links is required and precise knowledge of the link IMU poses is not necessary due to presented calibration routines. Additionally, a filter is introduced to fuse gyroscope angular velocities with joint position measurements and compensate the computed joint velocities for time-varying gyroscope biases. The resulting joint velocities are subject to less noise and delay than filtered velocities computed from numerical differentiation of joint potentiometer signals, leading to superior performance in joint feedback control as demonstrated in experiments performed on a SARCOS hydraulic humanoid."
icra,None,Gaussian Markov Random Fields for fusion in information form,"Liye Sun,Teresa Vidal-Calleja,Jaime Valls Miro,","2.5D maps are preferable for representing the environment owing to their compactness. When noisy observations from multiple diverse sensors at different resolutions are available, the problem of 2.5D mapping turns to how to compound the information in an effective and efficient manner. This paper proposes a generic probabilistic framework for fusing efficiently multiple sources of sensor data to generate amendable, high-resolution 2.5D maps. The key idea is to exploit the sparse structure of the information matrix. Gaussian Markov Random Fields are employed to learn a prior map, which uses the conditional independence property between spatial location to obtain a representation of the state with a sparse information matrix. This prior map encoded in information form can then be updated with other sources of sensor data in constant time. Later, mean state vector and variances can be also efficiently recovered using sparse matrices techniques. The proposed approach allows accurate estimation of 2.5D maps at arbitrary resolution, while incorporating sensor noise and spatial dependency in a statistically sound way. We apply the proposed framework to pipe wall thickness mapping and fuse data from two diverse sensors that have different resolutions. Experimental results are compared with three other methods, showing that, while greatly reducing computation time, the proposed framework is able to capture in large extend the spatial correlation to generate equivalent results to the computationally expensive optimal fusion method in covariance form with a Gaussian Process prior."
icra,None,Multi-sensor fusion of occupancy grids based on integer arithmetic,"Tiana Rakotovao,Julien Mottin,Diego Puschini,Christian Laugier,","For the last 25 years, occupancy grids have been intensively used as a well-understood framework for many robotic applications, such as path planning or obstacle avoidance. They offer a unifying framework for multiple heterogeneous sensor integration using a probabilistic representation of sensor data. This integration is computed through Bayesian techniques or evidence combination approaches, both requiring high computation workload using real number representation. In critical application domains, it is challenging to fuse data coming out of several sensors in real-time using constrained embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose a revised theoretical formulation of multi-sensor fusion using only integer arithmetic. We apply this novel framework to compute occupancy grid by only using integer numbers to represent probabilities. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, our fusion framework enables implementation on platforms with no floating-point support. Our experiments demonstrate that fusion of real automotive data from a 4-scans LIDAR can be integrated into a microcontroller without a floating-point unit. Our approach opens the perspective for microcontroller or even for hardware block based on ASIC or FPGA to support occupancy grid applications with real-time performance."

Friesen,Vytas SunSpiral,","Tensegrity robots are a class of compliant robots that have many desirable traits when designing mass efficient systems that must interact with uncertain environments. Various promising control approaches have been proposed for tensegrity systems in simulation. Unfortunately, state estimation methods for tensegrity robots have not yet been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a state estimator for tensegrity robots. This state estimator will enable existing and future control algorithms to transfer from simulation to hardware. Our approach is based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and combines inertial measurements, ultra wideband time-of-flight ranging measurements, and actuator state information. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the SUPERball, a tensegrity based planetary exploration robotic prototype. In particular, we conduct tests for evaluating both the robot's success in estimating global position in relation to fixed ranging base stations during rolling maneuvers as well as local behavior due to small-amplitude deformations induced by cable actuation."
icra,None,2D-image to 3D-range registration in urban environments via scene categorization and combination of similarity measurements,"Yipu Zhao,Yuanfang Wang,Yichang Tsai,","Statistical similarity measurements, such as mutual information (MI) and normalized mutual information (NMI), show potential in the registration of 2D-image to 3D-range scans collected in urban environments. However 2D-3D registration with these measurements are of limited usage in urban sensing applications because: 1) it relies on the diversity and dependency between pre-defined pair of 2D-3D attributes, such as the intensity from images and reflectivity from range scans, in the urban sensing environment, and 2) it requires high-end range sensors with strong abilities to capture reflectivity in urban scenarios. In this paper, we propose a robust way of estimating statistical similarity measurements for 2D-3D data that are collected in various urban scenes with both low-cost and high-end range sensors. Rather than estimate the similarity of 2D-3D data on specific pair of 2D-3D attributes, we compute similarity measurements between a set of 2D-3D attribute-pairs that could be dominant in the category of sensed urban scene and combine them into a reliable similarity measurement. By applying the combined similarity measurement to the common framework of statistical 2D-3D registration, we get superior results when compared with state-of-art similarity measurements (MI and NMI) in terms of registration accuracy and robustness to initial condition, as indicated by experiments conducted on two datasets that are collected in various urban scenes, with low-cost and high-end sensors."

It explicitly considers the measurement noise by modeling the surface using random variables. Furthermore, our proposed surface model provides an explicit estimation of the spatial uncertainty. The approach can be implemented on a GPU to achieve a high update performance and enable online updates of the model. The approach was evaluated in simulation and using real sensor data. In our experiments, we confirmed that it accurately estimates surfaces from noisy sensor data and that it provides a corresponding estimate of the uncertainty. We could also show that the approach is able to fuse measurements from sensors with different noise characteristics."

Atkeson,","This paper is about improving joint and actuator velocity estimates on a human-sized hydraulic humanoid robot by adding a network of inexpensive microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes. Due to the lack of joint velocity sensors on the majority of humanoid robots, the joint velocity estimates often become a limiting factor on the controller performance. The distributed gyroscopes serve as indirect sensors of the joint velocities that can be estimated by a Kalman filter. Using this framework, we achieve higher velocity gains at the center of mass level on an Atlas hydraulic humanoid robot, which translates into better control performance."
icra,None,Direct visual-inertial odometry with stereo cameras,"Vladyslav Usenko,Jakob Engel,Jörg Stückler,Daniel Cremers,","We propose a novel direct visual-inertial odometry method for stereo cameras. Camera pose, velocity and IMU biases are simultaneously estimated by minimizing a combined photometric and inertial energy functional. This allows us to exploit the complementary nature of vision and inertial data. At the same time, and in contrast to all existing visual-inertial methods, our approach is fully direct: geometry is estimated in the form of semi-dense depth maps instead of manually designed sparse keypoints. Depth information is obtained both from static stereo - relating the fixed-baseline images of the stereo camera - and temporal stereo - relating images from the same camera, taken at different points in time. We show that our method outperforms not only vision-only or loosely coupled approaches, but also can achieve more accurate results than state-of-the-art keypoint-based methods on different datasets, including rapid motion and significant illumination changes. In addition, our method provides high-fidelity semi-dense, metric reconstructions of the environment, and runs in real-time on a CPU."
icra,None,Micro-hand positioning in consideration of the obstacle avoidance and the grasping part by using the automatic stage,"Kotaro Yamamoto,Masaru Kojima,Mitsuhiro Horade,Kazuto Kamiyama,,,","Recently, manipulation and observation of the cells are actively conducted in order to analyze the biological phenomena. Since the micro hand is usually fixed to the work environment, grasping target point of the cell on the opposite side of the micro hand by using a micro hand is limited by narrow workspace. If we move the micro hand in vertical direction to grasp the target point of the cell on the opposite side of the micro hand, we cannot focus the micro hand and the object in the microscopic field of view at the same time. In order to overcome the limitations of the limited workspace of micro hand, we assist the target point of the cell grasped by translation and rotation of the automatic stage. In this paper, we propose an automatic stage system for support the operation of the micro hand. Our automatic stage system can detect the object in the microscopic field of view by the template matching using Hu moment invariant and determine the grasping convex part of the object. by convex hull. Additionally this system can do 2d path planning considering convex part of the object to want to grasp and obstacles, and lead the micro hand to the object."

A scaling analysis demonstrates that magnetic folding can be particularly favorable at small scales and this analysis is validated through both a dynamic simulation and experimental results. Experimental results are provided by three planar-fabricated, multi-material, fold-up cubes at three different length scales (down to 1.25 mm). The three cubes folded using this method demonstrate behavior consistent with derived scaling properties, but the dynamic simulation model was deemed insufficient to capture specific details of the cubes' behavior."

To transport the drugs, we use therapeutic magnetic microbeads as navigable agents controlled by magnetic gradients. The main difficulty is to control independently each therapeutic agent along a trajectory with the same magnetic gradient fields. This study proposes an optimal control methodology to control a group of different therapeutic agents at desired states. Based on a dynamic model of group of magnetic microbeads, controllability and observability conditions are formulated and simulated. Based on the proposed theoretical analysis a linear quadratic with integral action control (LQI) has been chosen to be applied to the microbeads system. Finally, an experimental investigation is carried out in millimeter-sized fluidic artery vessels to demonstrate the controllability and stability of two magnetic microbeads under different velocity and trajectory constraints with a laminar viscous fluidic environment."
icra,None,Independent control of two millimeter-scale soft-bodied magnetic robotic swimmers,"Jiachen Zhang,Piyush Jain,Eric Diller,","We present a method to independently control two millimeter-scale soft-bodied magnetic swimmers, with nominal dimensions of 1.5 × 4.9 × 0.06 mm. A swimmer's speed depends on its relative angle with the actuation magnetic field. The two swimmers under control have different directions of net magnetic moments, and assume distinct orientations in one global magnetic field. With this fixed heading difference between two swimmers, the global actuation field forms different relative angles with the two swimmers. By manipulating these two relative angles, the two swimmers can exhibit different speeds. Theoretically, any speed ratios can be achieved between the two swimmers. In practice, a relatively accurate speed ratio can be obtained when both swimmers have nonzero speeds and one swimmer is no more than twice as fast as the other. Adding the control over the strength of actuation field, two swimmers can obtain independent speeds within a certain range. Two feedback controllers are proposed to control two such swimmers to arrive at independent global points (positioning) and move along paths (path following). Type I Sequential Controller manipulates two swimmers to move to their respective goals in sequence, while Type II Parallel Controller moves both swimmers simultaneously. Experiments are presented in which two swimmers are controlled to pass a series of points to form the letters “UT”."

Khalil,Ahmet Fatih Tabak,Abdelrahman Hosney,Abdalla Mohamed,,,,","We use electrospinning to fabricate sperm-shaped magnetic microrobots with a range of diameters from 50 μm to 500 μm. The variables of the electrospinning operation (voltage, concentration of the solution, dynamic viscosity, and distance between the syringe needle and collector) to achieve beading effect are determined. This beading effect allows us to fabricate microrobots with similar morphology to that of sperm cells. The bead and the ultra-fine fiber resemble the morphology of the head and tail of the sperm cell, respectively. We incorporate iron oxide nanoparticles to the head of the sperm-shaped microrobot to provide a magnetic dipole moment. This dipole enables directional control under the influence of external magnetic fields. We also apply weak (less than 2 mT) oscillating magnetic fields to exert a magnetic torque on the magnetic head, and generate planar flagellar waves and flagellated swim. The average speed of the sperm-shaped microrobot is calculated to be 0.5 body lengths per second and 1 body lengths per second at frequencies of 5 Hz and 10 Hz, respectively.

In our previous works, a nanorobotic manipulation system was established inside an environmental-SEM (E-SEM) for water-contained samples, including biological organism, based on a real-time high resolution SEM observation. However, the SEM image is limited in two dimensional (2D) and surficial information from the signals of secondly electrons. For nanosurgery applications, such as nanoinjection, it is needed to evaluate the sample in 3D space with its internal information after manipulation. The SEM-CT imaging system is developed for In situ nanomanipulation based on SEM observation. The CT is an effective method to obtain the internal 3D information as a non-destructive manner. The imaging resolution of our SEM-CT system is in less than 400 nm. A Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was used as a target of biological sample. To improve the contrast of SEM-CT imaging of C. elegans, the X-ray was tested by generating using brass and copper materials. Finally, the nanoinjection was demonstrated with SEM-CT imaging system to C. elegans using the nanoinjector which was fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) process."

The algorithm uses a Multi- Armed Bandit model with correlated rewards to leverage prior grasps and 3D object models in a growing dataset that currently includes over 10,000 unique 3D object models and 2.5 million parallel-jaw grasps. Each grasp includes an estimate of the probability of force closure under uncertainty in object and gripper pose and friction. Dex-Net 1.0 uses Multi-View Convolutional Neural Networks (MV-CNNs), a new deep learning method for 3D object classification, to provide a similarity metric between objects, and the Google Cloud Platform to simultaneously run up to 1,500 virtual cores, reducing experiment runtime by up to three orders of magnitude. Experiments suggest that correlated bandit techniques can use a cloud-based network of object models to significantly reduce the number of samples required for robust grasp planning.

Participants were presented with two (front and side) orthogonal views of a robot hand grasping an object and asked how successful the grasp would be on a scale of 1-5; they were eye-tracked while completing this survey. Ground truth of the success of the grasps is known. Our primary observations were that (1) Most of the failed grasp predictions were false positives, and this was exacerbated for grasps that were ranked as human-like. (2) Two visual cues from human-grasp research (object center-line and top) were used, but not contact points. Instead, participants gazed at robot finger, wrist, and arm locations. (3) There was a difference in the visual patterns between the left and right images, indicating that the second image was primarily used to verify the locations of fingers and wrist while the first was used to establish the object's location and shape. Finally, we generate transition matrices to model the temporal aspect of the gaze patterns."
icra,None,Reflex control of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand during object slippage,"Arash Ajoudani,Elif Hocaoglu,Alessandro Altobelli,Matteo Rossi,,,,","In this work, to guarantee the Pisa/IIT SoftHand's grasp robustness against slippage, three reflex control modes, namely Current, Pose and Impedance, are implemented and experimentally evaluated. Towards this objective, ThimbleSense fingertip sensors are designed and integrated into the thumb and middle fingers of the SoftHand for real-time detection and control of the slippage. Current reflex regulates the restoring grasp forces of the hand by modulating the motor's current profile according to an update law. Pose and Impedance reflex modes instead replicate this behaviour by implementing an impedance control scheme. The difference between the two latter is that the stiffness gain in Impedance reflex mode is being varied in addition to the hand pose, as a function of the slippage on the fingertips. Experimental setup also includes a seven degrees-of-freedom robotic arm to realize consistent trajectories (e.g. lifting) among three control modes for the sake of comparison. Different test objects are considered to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed reflex modes in our experimental setup. Results suggest that task-appropriate restoring forces can be achieved using Impedance reflex due to its capability in demonstrating instantaneous and rather smooth reflexive behaviour during slippage. Preliminary experiments on five healthy human subjects provide evidence on the similarity of the control concepts exploited by the humans and the one realized by the Impedance reflex, highlighting its potential in prosthetic applications."

Wang,Jianjun Yuan,,,","We present a novel method for caging grasps in this paper by stretching ropes on the surface of a 3D object. Both topology and shape of a model to be grasped has been considered in our approach. Our algorithm can guarantee generating local minimal rings on every topological branches of a given model with the help of a Reeb graph. Cages and grasps can then be computed from these rings, and physical experimental tests have been conducted to verify the robustness of our approach."
icra,None,A fail-safe object handover controller,"Sina Parastegari,Ehsan Noohi,Bahareh Abbasi,Miloš Žefran,",Humans rely on a multitude of senses to achieve a safe handover. The challenge for a robot-human handover is to both equip the robot with the appropriate sensors as well as devise handover controllers that effectively use them to prevent failures. In this paper we use object acceleration as an indicator of an impending handover failure and propose a handover controller that has re-grasping mechanism to prevent falling of the object in case of an imperfect handover. The work is motivated by our observation that humans primarily rely on vision to prevent handover failure. We also propose a novel acceleration sensing setup that can be integrated into a robot gripper. The handover controller is implemented on Baxter Research robot equipped with the proposed sensor and is shown to be effective in preventing object fall.
icra,None,Lightweight underactuated pneumatic fingers capable of grasping various objects,"Ashlih Dameitry,Hideyuki Tsukagoshi,","This paper presents the design and implementation of a lightweight and powerful fingers actuator capable of grasping various shaped objects. The proposed fingers actuator is designed on the underactuated structure formed by a thumb and an index finger, which are composed of a zigzag tube with one chamber and a soft polyurethane foam with notch. When the inside of the tube is pressurized by pneumatics, each finger joint can be bent simultaneously performing one degree of freedom motion. Due to the compliance of pneumatic and the softness of the structure, it can automatically hold various types of objects. The design parameter of each joint is illustrated in order to base on distributed grasping force evenly against the objects. The developed fingers could not only perform wide range of grasping but also realize two and half times larger force/weight ratio than general fingers actuator with electric servo motor. Lastly, as the application of the proposed fingers, it is mounted on an aerial manipulator for the door opening mission, and its validity is experimentally verified."
icra,None,Grasp detection for assistive robotic manipulation,"Siddarth Jain,Brenna Argall,","In this paper, we present a novel grasp detection algorithm targeted towards assistive robotic manipulation systems. We consider the problem of detecting robotic grasps using only the raw point cloud depth data of a scene containing unknown objects, and apply a geometric approach that categorizes objects into geometric shape primitives based on an analysis of local surface properties. Grasps are detected without a priori models, and the approach can generalize to any number of novel objects that fall within the shape primitive categories. Our approach generates multiple candidate object grasps, which moreover are semantically meaningful and similar to what a human would generate when teleoperating the robot-and thus should be suitable manipulation goals for assistive robotic systems. An evaluation of our algorithm on 30 household objects includes a pilot user study, confirms the robustness of the detected grasps and was conducted in real-world experiments using an assistive robotic arm."
icra,None,On the evolution of fingertip grasping manifolds,"K. Hang,J. A. Haustein,M. Li,A. Billard,C. Smith,D. Kragic,","Efficient and accurate planning of fingertip grasps is essential for dexterous in-hand manipulation. In this work, we present a system for fingertip grasp planning that incrementally learns a heuristic for hand reachability and multi-fingered inverse kinematics. The system consists of an online execution module and an offline optimization module. During execution the system plans and executes fingertip grasps using Canny's grasp quality metric and a learned random forest based hand reachability heuristic. In the offline module, this heuristic is improved based on a grasping manifold that is incrementally learned from the experiences collected during execution. The system is evaluated both in simulation and on a Schunk-SDH dexterous hand mounted on a KUKA-KR5 arm. We show that, as the grasping manifold is adapted to the system's experiences, the heuristic becomes more accurate, which results in an improved performance of the execution module. The improvement is not only observed for experienced objects, but also for previously unknown objects of similar sizes."
icra,None,Wrench resistant multi-finger hand mechanisms,"Joel W. Burdick,Elon Rimon,","The classical definition and analysis of force closure in robotic grasping focuses only on the fingertip bodies and their contacts with the grasped object. However, the kinematic properties of the hand mechanism can have a non-trivial effect on the actual type of force closure which can be realized at a given grasp. This paper takes a new look at this classical problem, and introduces technical results on force closure, or wrench resistance, which incorporate the hand mechanism's kinematics in this important grasp security measure. Based on a decomposition of the finger contact forces into canonical subspaces, the paper introduces a division of the finger contact forces into active and passive forces, as well as a dual division into resistant and internal contact forces. The paper develops new formal definitions of these concepts, and describes their mutual orthogonality relationships. Based on these definitions, the paper introduces new theorems of wrench resistant grasps which factor the hand mechanism's structure into the analysis of a given grasp. Examples illustrate how the hand mechanism's structure affects its ability to maintain secure wrench resistant grasps."
icra,None,Object discovery and grasp detection with a shared convolutional neural network,"Di Guo,Tao Kong,Fuchun Sun,Huaping Liu,","Grasp an object from a stack of objects in real-time is still a challenge in robotics. This requires the robot to have the ability of both fast object discovery and grasp detection: a target object should be picked out from the stack first and then a proper grasp configuration is applied to grasp the object. In this paper, we propose a shared convolutional neural network (CNN) which can simultaneously implement these two tasks in real-time. The processing speed of the model is about 100 frames per second on a GPU which largely satisfies the requirement. Meanwhile, we also establish a labeled RGBD dataset which contains scenes of stacked objects for robotic grasping. At last, we demonstrate the implementation of our shared CNN model on a real robotic platform and show that the robot can accurately discover a target object from the stack and successfully grasp it."
icra,None,Precision grasping based on probabilistic models of unknown objects,"Dong Chen,Vincent Dietrich,Georg von Wichert,","Reliable precision grasping for unknown objects is a prerequisite for robots that work in the field of logistics, manufacturing and household tasks. The nature of this task requires a simultaneous solution of a mixture of sub-problems. These include estimating object properties, finding viable grasps and executing grasps without displacement. We propose to explicitly take perceptual uncertainty into account during grasp execution. The underlying object representation is a probabilistic signed distance field, which includes both signed distances to the surface and spatially interpretable variances. Based on this representation, we propose a two-stage grasp generation method, which is specifically designed for generating precision grasps. In order to evaluate the whole approach, we perform extensive real world grasping experiments on a set of hard-to-grasp objects. Our approach achieves 78% success rate and shows robustness to the placement orientation."
icra,None,Investigation of effects of dynamics on intrinsic wrench sensing in continuum robots,"Rajarshi Roy,Long Wang,Nabil Simaan,","Multi-backbone continuum robots have been demonstrated to possess wrench sensing capabilities by measuring the actuation load on each backbone and then using elaborate statics models. The ability to sense forces of interaction allows these robots to also control their interaction with the environment. In past studies, the force sensing models were subject to quasi-static assumptions. The goal of this paper is threefold: to update the wrench sensing model taking into account dynamic forces, to investigate the effect of these dynamic forces on the wrench sensing abilities of these robots and to present design atlases that help designers with the determination of critical dimensions ensuring bounded effect of dynamics on wrench sensing. The paper presents a simplified dynamics model using a Lagrangian formulation. This dynamics model is then used to update the wrench estimation model for a single-segment continuum robot. Finally, a set of normalized parameters is used to produce design atlases that help designers predict the effect of dynamics on the wrench estimation model. These results will allow improved performance in force sensing and control for multi-backbone continuum robots. Employing the methods presented in the paper, continuum robots, that have previously demonstrated excellent distal dexterity, will be able to control their force interaction with the anatomy better in future - thereby improving safety and the finesse of surgery."
icra,None,RobWorkPhysicsEngine: A new dynamic simulation engine for manipulation actions,"Thomas N. Thulesen,Henrik G. Petersen,","Simulation in robotics is often based on physics engines developed for computer games and animation. These engines are inaccurate due to the applied first order numerical integration and because their ways to resolve redundant contacts lead to contact forces that are distributed in a physically unreasonable way among multiple contacts. In this paper, we present a new physics engine that resolves these flaws by designing and implementing a second order integration method, and by a new way of defining the contact-force resolution problem. We illustrate the improvement over state-of-the-art engines by a number of experiments. The new engine is proven to be particularly suitable for simulating tight fitting assembly operations where multiple contacts occur between the objects involved."
icra,None,A trajectory optimization formulation for assistive robotic devices,"Sourav Rakshit,Srinivas Akella,","We present a trajectory optimization formulation for the design of a sit-to-stand assistive device for humans with motion impairments. We develop a constrained Lagrangian to derive the equations of motion for the trajectory optimization formulation. Such a Lagrangian enables us to impose constraints on joint reaction wrenches in the human, to simulate the motion impairment of human joints due to injury and infirmity. Using trajectory optimization, we compute the optimal sit-to-stand motions of a human as well as the actuation wrenches of the sit-to-stand device. The trajectory of the device as it follows and supports the human, and its actuation wrenches provide necessary inputs for the design of the assistive device. We propose an assistive device capable of following the natural trajectory of the human during sit-to-stand. We show by numerical simulation that the human requires less effort with the device that can follow its trajectory than with an assistive device restricted to only vertical motion to lift up a human. Our formulation provides a systematic approach for the design of such sit-to-stand assistive devices."
icra,None,Extracting feasible robot parameters from dynamic coefficients using nonlinear optimization methods,"Claudio Gaz,Fabrizio Flacco,Alessandro De Luca,","We consider the problem of extracting a complete set of numerical parameters that characterize the robot dynamics, starting from the identified values of dynamic coefficients that linearly parametrize the robot dynamic equations. This information is relevant when realistic dynamic simulations have to be performed using standard packages, or when addressing the efficient numerical implementation of model-based control laws using recursive Newton-Euler algorithms. The formulated problem is highly nonlinear and is solved through the use of global optimization techniques, while imposing also physical bounds on the dynamic parameters. The identification and parameter extraction process is illustrated and experimentally validated on the link dynamics of a KUKA LWR IV+ robot."
icra,None,Aiming and vaulting: Spider inspired leaping for jumping robots,"Hossein Faraji,Ramsey Tachella,Ross L. Hatton,","Jumping spiders are capable of targeted jumps by using their front legs to guide the release of energy from their rear legs. In this paper, we present a simplified model of the jumping spider based on the anatomy of the real spider. The immediate goal of this model is to understand how the geometry of the legs affects the jumping motion, with the further goal of using this geometry in the future development of jumping robots. Through a set of simulations, dynamic analysis, and experiments with a physical realization of our model, we identify several features of the spiders' jumping mechanism, most notably that “vaulting” with the front legs allows the system to generate flatter take-off trajectories than could be achieved by simple aiming of a spring-release mechanism."
icra,None,Fast forward dynamics simulation of robot manipulators with highly frictional gears,"Naoki Wakisaka,Ryo Kikuuwe,Tomomichi Sugihara,","An efficient method to compute the joint friction torques as well as the external contact forces in forward dynamics simulation of a robot manipulator is proposed. The existence of friction inside mechanical gears substantially affects behaviors of the robot, and hence, should be taken into account. The strict form of the equation of motion disables distinguishing the internal friction torques from the external forces, which causes an increase of the degree of indeterminacy and the computation cost. A semi-implicit approach in which the internal friction torques and the external contact forces are alternatively computed is proposed based on an assumption that the net joint actuation torque does not much vary in a short interval. It significantly reduces the computation cost at a comparative accuracy with a completely implicit method."
icra,None,Inverse kinematics and design of a novel 6-DoF handheld robot arm,"Austin Gregg-Smith,Walterio W. Mayol-Cuevas,","We present a novel 6-DoF cable driven manipulator for handheld robotic tasks. Based on a coupled tendon approach, the arm is optimized to maximize movement speed and configuration space while reducing the total mass of the arm. We propose a space carving approach to design optimal link geometry maximizing structural strength and joint limits while minimizing link mass. The design improves on similar non-handheld tendon-driven manipulators and reduces the required number of actuators to one per DoF. As the manipulator has one redundant joint, we present a 5-DoF inverse kinematics solution for the end effector pose. The inverse kinematics is solved by splitting the 6-DoF problem into two coupled 3-DoF problems and merging their results. A method for gracefully degrading the output of the inverse kinematics is described for cases where the desired end effector pose is outside the configuration space. This is useful for settings where the user is in the control loop and can help the robot to get closer to the desired location. The design of the handheld robot is offered as open source. While our results and tools are aimed at handheld robotics, the design and approach is useful to non-handheld applications."
icra,None,Kinematic modeling and singularity treatment of steerable wheeled mobile robots with joint acceleration limits,"Mohamed Sorour,Andrea Cherubini,Robin Passama,Philippe Fraisse,","Non-holonomic omnidirectional mobile robots have higher load carrying capacity than their holonomic counterparts. Once the steer joint configuration is initialized, they can perform arbitrarily complex three-dimensional trajectories in the plane of motion and, as such, are more suitable for industrial contexts. However, their kinematic model presents representational and structural singularities, solutions to which must respect actuator performance limits. Recent research efforts have provided either simple restricting of the velocity space (among which few considered hardware limits) or complex non-restricting (no hardware limits considered) solutions. Most of these efforts are providing solutions at the kinematic control level. Instead, here we propose both a representational singularity free kinematic model, and a simple numeric treatment for the kinematic singularity. We further provide a method to tune the latter, to respect the actuator acceleration limits. Thanks to its steer rate damping behavior, the method can be further extended, to respect joint limits. Another benefit is the treatment of the singularity at the level of the kinematic model, which enhances real time capabilities. The developed method has been tested successfully on the Neobotix-MPO700 mobile robot and shown superior results as compared to the embedded controller."
icra,None,"The second generation prototype of a Duct Climbing Tensegrity robot, DuCTTv2","Jeffrey M. Friesen,Paul Glick,Michael Fanton,Pavlo Manovi,Alexander Xydes,,,","Duct exploration and maintenance is a task well suited for small agile robots, which must be capable of navigating complex and irregular systems of ducts. Previously, we presented a tensegrity robot, DuCTT (Duct Climbing Tetrahedral Tensegrity), which demonstrated the plausibility of such a robot for duct exploration but was never able to successfully demonstrate climbing. Here we present DuCTTv2, redesigned from the ground up to address issues with actuator power, cable routing, compliance and synchronized control present in our first prototype. These improvements allow the prototype to be the first tensegrity robot to demonstrate duct climbing, and does so with an average climb speed of 1.4 cm/s. We also demonstrate initial tests of the prototypes ability to bend and translate its two segments relative to one another, which will allow it to navigate T-junctions and sharp corners commonly found in duct systems. Testing of the prototype is conducted to demonstrate the new faster and more robust control of motion, and analysis of dynamic simulations is presented."
icra,None,Power manipulability analysis of redundantly actuated parallel kinematic manipulators with different types of actuators,"Michael Lorenz,Jan Brinker,Isabel Prause,Burkhard Corves,","Spatial object manipulation is typically accomplished by parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM), whose number of actuators is equal to the required number of degrees of freedom. In order to improve the performance and reliability of PKM, their basic configuration can be extended by redundant actuators. This paper is devoted to the special case of PKM with both linear and rotational actuation, which can be operated simultaneously. Corresponding manipulators face the problem of coexisting translational and rotational joint space parameters inducing inhomogeneous Jacobian matrices. In this context, power manipulability ellipsoids provide a suitable performance evaluation for PKM featuring different types of redundantly applicable actuators. Accordingly, this research intends to analyze the kinetostatic performance of redundantly actuated PKM and to demonstrate their efficiency in contrast to non-redundant drive configurations. The analyses exemplarily are focused on the translational 3-RPC manipulator, since it can be equipped with both revolute and/or prismatic joint actuation."
icra,None,Design of a spherical robot arm with the Spiral Zipper prismatic joint,"Foster Collins,Mark Yim,","A novel prismatic joint called a Spiral Zipper is used to create a 3DOF robot arm in a spherical robot configuration. The Spiral Zipper can be very compact as it has a large extension to compression ratio. An initial prototype has shown a ratio of over 14:1. The Spiral Zipper is very strong in compression, but maybe loose under tension and moments. A tether based system ensures the prismatic joint is always in compression while enabling spherical coordinate positioning with a long reach, high force, low mass design. While having typically an order magnitude higher strength to weight ratio for a given reach compared to standard industrial robot arms, the arm is slower and was not designed for high precision. These characteristics may be applicable for mounting on mobile robots or flying vehicles. This paper introduces the design and testing of several prototypes."
icra,None,"Robot learning with a spatial, temporal, and causal and-or graph","Caiming Xiong,Nishant Shukla,Wenlong Xiong,Song-Chun Zhu,","We propose a stochastic graph-based framework for a robot to understand tasks from human demonstrations and perform them with feedback control. It unifies both knowledge representation and action planning in the same hierarchical data structure, allowing a robot to expand its spatial, temporal, and causal knowledge at varying levels of abstraction. The learning system can watch human demonstrations, generalize learned concepts, and perform tasks in new environments, across different robotic platforms. We show the success of our system by having a robot perform a cloth-folding task after watching few human demonstrations. The robot can accurately reproduce the learned skill, as well as generalize the task to other articles of clothing."
icra,None,Robust single-view instance recognition,"David Held,Sebastian Thrun,Silvio Savarese,","Some robots must repeatedly interact with a fixed set of objects in their environment. To operate correctly, it is helpful for the robot to be able to recognize the object instances that it repeatedly encounters. However, current methods for recognizing object instances require that, during training, many pictures are taken of each object from a large number of viewing angles. This procedure is slow and requires much manual effort before the robot can begin to operate in a new environment. We have developed a novel procedure for training a neural network to recognize a set of objects from just a single training image per object. To obtain robustness to changes in viewpoint, we take advantage of a supplementary dataset in which we observe a separate (non-overlapping) set of objects from multiple viewpoints. After pre-training the network in a novel multi-stage fashion, the network can robustly recognize new object instances given just a single training image of each object. If more images of each object are available, the performance improves. We perform a thorough analysis comparing our novel training procedure to traditional neural network pre-training techniques as well as previous state-of-the-art approaches including keypoint-matching, template-matching, and sparse coding, and we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms these previous approaches. Our method can thus be used to easily teach a robot to recognize a novel set of object instances from unknown viewpoints."
icra,None,Deep metric learning autoencoder for nonlinear temporal alignment of human motion,"Xiaochuan Yin,Qijun Chen,",Temporal alignment is an important preprocessing procedure for human action recognition. The challenge of temporal alignment problem is the temporal scale difference between human actions as well as the variability of each subject. Metric learning is the central problem of temporal alignment. This paper presents a nonlinear time alignment method with deep autoencoder. The spatio-temporal features obtained from the neural network contain the metric information for feature comparison. The effectiveness of our method is verified with k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier on MSR-Action 3D and MSR-Daily Activity 3D datasets. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other metric based techniques.
icra,None,Optimizing for what matters: The top grasp hypothesis,"Daniel Kappler,Stefan Schaal,Jeannette Bohg,","In this paper, we consider the problem of robotic grasping of objects when only partial and noisy sensor data of the environment is available. We are specifically interested in the problem of reliably selecting the best hypothesis from a whole set. This is commonly the case when trying to grasp an object for which we can only observe a partial point cloud from one viewpoint through noisy sensors. There will be many possible ways to successfully grasp this object, and even more which will fail. We propose a supervised learning method that is trained with a ranking loss. This explicitly encourages that the top-ranked training grasp in a hypothesis set is also positively labeled. We show how we adapt the standard ranking loss to work with data that has binary labels and explain the benefits of this formulation. Additionally, we show how we can efficiently optimize this loss with stochastic gradient descent. In quantitative experiments, we show that we can outperform previous models by a large margin."
icra,None,Real-time 3D scene layout from a single image using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Shichao Yang,Daniel Maturana,Sebastian Scherer,","We consider the problem of understanding the 3D layout of indoor corridor scenes from a single image in real time. Identifying obstacles such as walls is essential for robot navigation, but also challenging due to the diversity in structure, appearance and illumination of real-world corridor scenes. Many current single-image methods make Manhattan-world assumptions, and break down in environments that do not meet this mold. They also may require complicated hand-designed features for image segmentation or clear boundaries to form certain building models. In addition, most cannot run in real time. In this paper, we propose to combine machine learning with geometric modelling to build a simplified 3D model from a single image. We first employ a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to provide a dense, but coarse, geometric class labelling of the scene. We then refine this labelling with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Finally, we fit line segments along wall-ground boundaries and “pop up” a 3D model using geometric constraints. We assemble a dataset of 967 labelled corridor images. Our experiments on this dataset and another publicly available dataset show our method outperforms other single image scene understanding methods in pixelwise accuracy while labelling images at over 15Hz."
icra,None,How many bits do I need for matching local binary descriptors?,"Pablo F. Alcantarilla,Björn Stenger,","In this paper we provide novel insights about the performance and design of popular pairwise tests-based local binary descriptors with the aim of answering the question: How many bits are needed for matching local binary descriptors? We use the interpretation of binary descriptors as a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme for approximating Kendall's tau rank distance between image patches. Based on this understanding we compare local binary descriptors in terms of the number of bits that are required to achieve a certain performance in feature-based matching problems. Furthermore, we introduce a calibration method to automatically determine a suitable number of bits required in an image matching scenario. We provide a performance analysis in image matching and structure from motion benchmarks, showing calibration results in visual odometry and object recognition problems. Our results show that excellent performance can be achieved using a small fraction of the total number of bits from the whole descriptor, speeding-up matching and reducing storage requirements."
icra,None,Fusing LIDAR and images for pedestrian detection using convolutional neural networks,"Joel Schlosser,Christopher K. Chow,Zsolt Kira,","In this paper, we explore various aspects of fusing LIDAR and color imagery for pedestrian detection in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have recently become state-of-art for many vision problems. We incorporate LIDAR by up-sampling the point cloud to a dense depth map and then extracting three features representing different aspects of the 3D scene. We then use those features as extra image channels. Specifically, we leverage recent work on HHA [9] (horizontal disparity, height above ground, and angle) representations, adapting the code to work on up-sampled LIDAR rather than Microsoft Kinect depth maps. We show, for the first time, that such a representation is applicable to up-sampled LIDAR data, despite its sparsity. Since CNNs learn a deep hierarchy of feature representations, we then explore the question: At what level of representation should we fuse this additional information with the original RGB image channels? We use the KITTI pedestrian detection dataset for our exploration. We first replicate the finding that region-CNNs (R-CNNs) [8] can outperform the original proposal mechanism using only RGB images, but only if fine-tuning is employed. Then, we show that: 1) using HHA features and RGB images performs better than RGB-only, even without any fine-tuning using large RGB web data, 2) fusing RGB and HHA achieves the strongest results if done late, but, under a parameter or computational budget, is best done at the early to middle layers of the hierarchical representation, which tend to represent midlevel features rather than low (e.g. edges) or high (e.g. object class decision) level features, 3) some of the less successful methods have the most parameters, indicating that increased classification accuracy is not simply a function of increased capacity in the neural network."
icra,None,Alextrac: Affinity learning by exploring temporal reinforcement within association chains,"Alex Bewley,Lionel Ott,Fabio Ramos,Ben Upcroft,","This paper presents a self-supervised approach for learning to associate object detections in a video sequence as often required in tracking-by-detection systems. In this paper we focus on learning an affinity model to estimate the data association cost, which can adapt to different situations by exploiting the sequential nature of video data. We also propose a framework for gathering additional training samples at test time with high variation in visual appearance, naturally inherent in large temporal windows. Reinforcing the model with these difficult samples greatly improves the affinity model compared to standard similarity measures such as cosine similarity. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the resulting affinity model on several multiple object tracking (MOT) benchmark sequences. Using the affinity model alone places this approach in the top 25 state-of-the-art trackers with an average rank of 21.3 across 11 test sequences and an overall multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 17%. This is considerable as our simple approach only uses the appearance of the detected regions in contrast to other techniques with global optimisation or complex motion models."
icra,None,Re-using prior tactile experience by robotic hands to discriminate in-hand objects via texture properties,"Mohsen Kaboli,Rich Walker,Gordon Cheng,","This paper proposes an online tactile transfer learning strategy for discriminating objects through the surface texture properties via a robotic hand and an artificial robotic skin. The proposed method has the ability to autonomously select and exploit the previously learned multiple texture models while discriminating new textures with a very few available training samples or even one. The experimental results show that employing the proposed method and 10 prior texture models, the robotic hand could discriminate 12 objects via their surface textures with 97% and 100% recognition accuracy with only one and ten training samples respectively. Moreover, the experimental outcomes illustrate that our proposed algorithm is robust against of any negative tactile knowledge transfer."
icra,None,An efficient probabilistic surface normal estimator,"Daniel J. Lee,Mark E. Campbell,","An efficient surface normal estimation method is presented. The new algorithm estimates surface normal direction for each cell in a grid based on the occupancy information (both occupied and empty) of the neighboring cells. This grid representation allows user-defined sizes and scaling with the environment, not the number of measurements. Recursive and batch formulations to obtain the posterior estimate are presented, and compared. A computationally efficient implementation is derived which provides consistent and accurate estimates as measurements become available. Both simulation and experimental results are shown, demonstrating comparable estimation performance to that of using Point Cloud Library, but with significantly reduced computation time."
icra,None,Simultaneous dense scene reconstruction and object labeling,"Umar Asif,Mohammed Bennamoun,Ferdous Sohel,","This paper presents an efficient system for simultaneous dense scene reconstruction and object labeling in real-world environments (captured with an RGB-D sensor). The proposed system starts with the generation of object proposals in the scene. It then tracks spatio-temporally consistent object proposals across multiple frames and produces a dense reconstruction of the scene. In parallel, the proposed system uses an efficient inference algorithm, where object class probabilities are computed at an object-level and fused into a voxel-based prediction hypothesis modeled on the voxels of the reconstructed scene. Our extensive experiments using challenging RGB-D object and scene datasets, and live video streams from Microsoft Kinect show that the proposed system achieved competitive 3D scene reconstruction and object labeling results compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
icra,None,Hierarchical graph-based discovery of non-primitive-shaped objects in unstructured environments,"Christian A. Mueller,Andreas Birk,","We present a hierarchical graph-based approach for unknown object discovery in RGB-D point clouds captured with a Kinect-like sensor from unstructured scenes. A two-step approach is proposed which first extracts meaningful regions from an input scene through over-segmentation. Secondly, a procedure is introduced to detect compositions of such regions that can represent primitive-shaped object candidates like boxes or cylinders. Complex-shaped objects are interpreted as a composition of primitive-shaped objects, for instance, a teddy bear can consist of two convex-shaped arms, legs, a convex-shaped head and torso. An ensemble of classifiers is trained to learn patterns from the appearances of such neighboring primitive shapes that constitute complex-shaped objects. Therein the appearance is described by a set of features from the texture and geometry domain. For the experiments, a dataset was prepared which is publicly available, containing a set of scenes which consists of 296 human-annotated object instances in total. Experiments show that the proposed hierarchical approach is capable to extract meaningful regions: an under-segmentation rate of 2.6% has been achieved. Furthermore, objects are segmented with a segmentation rate of 92.9% which reflects the capability of our approach to detect potential object candidates within unstructured scenes."
icra,None,Cluttered scene segmentation using the symmetry constraint,"Aleksandrs Ecins,Cornelia Fermüller,Yiannis Aloimonos,","Although modern object segmentation algorithms can deal with isolated objects in simple scenes, segmenting non-convex objects in cluttered environments remains a challenging task. We introduce a novel approach for segmenting unknown objects in partial 3D pointclouds that utilizes the powerful concept of symmetry. First, 3D bilateral symmetries in the scene are detected efficiently by extracting and matching surface normal edge curves in the pointcloud. Symmetry hypotheses are then used to initialize a segmentation process that finds points of the scene that are consistent with each of the detected symmetries. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 3D pointcloud scans of tabletop scenes. We demonstrate that the use of the symmetry constraint enables our approach to correctly segment objects in challenging configurations and to outperform current state-of-the-art approaches."
icra,None,Part-based room categorization for household service robots,"Peter Uršič,Rok Mandeljc,Aleš Leonardis,Matej Kristan,","A service robot that operates in a previously-unseen home environment should be able to recognize the functionality of the rooms it visits, such as a living room, a bathroom, etc. We present a novel part-based model and an approach for room categorization using data obtained from a visual sensor. Images are represented with sets of unordered parts that are obtained by object-agnostic region proposals, and encoded using state-of-the-art image descriptor extractor - a convolutional neural network (CNN). An approach is proposed that learns category-specific discriminative parts for the part-based model. The proposed approach was compared to the state-of-the-art CNN trained specifically for place recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the holistic CNN by being robust to image degradation, such as occlusions, modifications of image scaling, and aspect changes. In addition, we report non-negligible annotation errors and image duplicates in a popular dataset for place categorization and discuss annotation ambiguities."
icra,None,"When 2.5D is not enough: Simultaneous reconstruction, segmentation and recognition on dense SLAM","Keisuke Tateno,Federico Tombari,Nassir Navab,","While the main trend of 3D object recognition has been to infer object detection from single views of the scene - i.e., 2.5D data - this work explores the direction on performing object recognition on 3D data that is reconstructed from multiple viewpoints, under the conjecture that such data can improve the robustness of an object recognition system. To achieve this goal, we propose a framework whichreal-time segmentation is able (i) to carry out incremental real-time segmentation of a 3D scene while being reconstructed via Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), and (ii) to simultaneously and incrementally carry out 3D object recognition and pose estimation on the reconstructed and segmented 3D representations. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach with respect to traditional single view-based object recognition and pose estimation approaches, as well as its usefulness in robotic perception and augmented reality applications."
icra,None,Environment exploration for object-based visual saliency learning,"Céline Craye,David Filliat,Jean-François Goudou,","Searching for objects in an indoor environment can be drastically improved if a task-specific visual saliency is available. We describe a method to incrementally learn such an object-based visual saliency directly on a robot, using an environment exploration mechanism. We first define saliency based on a geometrical criterion and use this definition to segment salient elements given an attentive but costly and restrictive observation of the environment. These elements are used to train a fast classifier that predicts salient objects given large-scale visual features. In order to get a better and faster learning, we use an exploration strategy based on intrinsic motivation to drive our displacement in order to get relevant observations. Our approach has been tested on a robot in indoor environments as well as on publicly available RGB-D images sequences. We demonstrate that the approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the case of indoor object detection and that the exploration strategy can drastically decrease the time required for learning saliency."
icra,None,"Efficient, dense, object-based segmentation from RGBD video","Mahsa Ghafarianzadeh,Matthew B. Blaschko,Gabe Sibley,","Spatio-temporal cues offer a rich source of information for inferring structural and semantic scene properties. A particularly useful representation in computer vision is a spatio-temporal video segmentation. Together with motion, knowledge of depth can substantially improve superpixel segmentation. In this work we present a novel framework for spatio-temporal segmentation from RGBD video. The method employs both low-level (intensity, color) and high-level (deformable parts model) appearance features. Motion is incorporated through the use of optical flow to construct the temporal connections in the graph Laplacian. Depth cues are incorporated in the similarity metric to provide an informative cue for object boundaries at depth disparities. Naïve application of spectral clustering to dense spatio-temporal graphs leads to a high computational cost that is typically addressed through the use of GPUs or computer clusters. By contrast, we build upon a recently proposed Nyström approximation strategy for spatio-temporal clustering that enables computation on a single core. We further explore structured local connectivity patterns to give high performance at low computational cost. Also we propose a novel context-aware aggregation method that uses a deformable parts model to group the detected parts of the object as a single segment with an accurate boundary. Detailed experiments on the NYU Depth Dataset and TUM RGBD Dataset is performed to compare against previous large-scale graph-based spatio-temporal segmentation techniques which shows the substantial performance advantages of our framework."
icra,None,Understand scene categories by objects: A semantic regularized scene classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Yiyi Liao,Sarath Kodagoda,Yue Wang,Lei Shi,Yong Liu,","Scene classification is a fundamental perception task for environmental understanding in today's robotics. In this paper, we have attempted to exploit the use of popular machine learning technique of deep learning to enhance scene understanding, particularly in robotics applications. As scene images have larger diversity than the iconic object images, it is more challenging for deep learning methods to automatically learn features from scene images with less samples. Inspired by human scene understanding based on object knowledge, we address the problem of scene classification by encouraging deep neural networks to incorporate object-level information. This is implemented with a regularization of semantic segmentation. With only 5 thousand training images, as opposed to 2.5 million images, we show the proposed deep architecture achieves superior scene classification results to the state-of-the-art on a publicly available SUN RGB-D dataset. In addition, performance of semantic segmentation, the regularizer, also reaches a new record with refinement derived from predicted scene labels. Finally, we apply our model trained on SUN RGB-D dataset to a set of images captured in our university using a mobile robot, demonstrating the generalization ability of the proposed algorithm."
icra,None,Detection of pedestrians at far distance,"Rudy Bunel,Franck Davoine,Philippe Xu,","Pedestrian detection is a well-studied problem. Even though many datasets contain challenging case studies, the performances of new methods are often only reported on cases of reasonable difficulty. In particular, the issue of small scale pedestrian detection is seldom considered. In this paper, we focus on the detection of small scale pedestrians, i.e., those that are at far distance from the camera. We show that classical features used for pedestrian detection are not well suited for our case of study. Instead, we propose a convolutional neural network based method to learn the features with an end-to-end approach. Experiments on the Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark showed that we outperformed existing methods by more than 10% in terms of log-average miss rate."
icra,None,Integrated on-line robot-camera calibration and object pose estimation,"Karl Pauwels,Danica Kragic,","We present a novel on-line approach for extrinsic robot-camera calibration, a process often referred to as hand-eye calibration, that uses object pose estimates from a real-time model-based tracking approach. While off-line calibration has seen much progress recently due to the incorporation of bundle adjustment techniques, on-line calibration still remains a largely open problem. Since we update the calibration in each frame, the improvements can be incorporated immediately in the pose estimation itself to facilitate object tracking. Our method does not require the camera to observe the robot or to have markers at certain fixed locations on the robot. To comply with a limited computational budget, it maintains a fixed size configuration set of samples. This set is updated each frame in order to maximize an observability criterion. We show that a set of size 20 is sufficient in real-world scenarios with static and actuated cameras. With this set size, only 100 microseconds are required to update the calibration in each frame, and we typically achieve accurate robot-camera calibration in 10 to 20 seconds. Together, these characteristics enable the incorporation of calibration in normal task execution."

The proposed DOB allows for the nonlinearities of the robot dynamics, whereas the typical DOB designs cannot. Moreover, by virtue of the passivity property, human operator and environmental interactions can be embedded in the control loop. As a DOB, the proposed approach has a disturbance observation property that makes the actual robot behave like a nominal model selected by the user. Performance analysis proposes a gain tuning rule. In experimental validation, actual powered upper-limb robot is used to perform unknown payload carrying applications."
icra,None,Control of constrained robots subject to unilateral contacts and friction cone constraints,"Farhad Aghili,Chun-Yi Su,","The projection-based control of a rather general class of robots subject to linear and quadratic inequality constraints pertinent to unilateral contacts and friction cones is presented. The controller can also take into account other physical constraints levied by actuator saturation limits and/or existence of some unactuated joints, and can minimize actuation effort for redundant systems. Moreover, since the controller is not based on derivation of minimal-order dynamics model, it can easily handle contact switching. Therefore, a single controller can be used for different constraint conditions, which is very appealing for applications such as legged robots or grasping robots. The orthogonal decomposition of the generalized force vector yields the primary and secondary control inputs, which are used for motion control and interaction control, respectively. It is shown that the problem of minimizing actuation effort subject to the constraints due to the friction cones, unilateral contacts, and actuation limitations, can be transcripted into an optimization programming in terms of the secondary control variable. The latter optimization problem has a quadratic cost function accompanied by a set of quadratic and linear inequality constraints plus linear equality constraints that can be solved by barrier methods."
icra,None,A hierarchical approach to minimum-time control of industrial robots,"Saed Al Homsi,Alexander Sherikov,Dimitar Dimitrov,Pierre-Brice Wieber,","A novel approach to minimum-time control is presented. It is stated in terms of a hierarchical optimization problem, which is standard in the field of robotics. This is advantageous as already existing tools can be used to approach its solution. Our formulation is applied to the online generation of trajectories for industrial robots performing pick and place operations in the presence of obstacles. Model predictive control is used in order to achieve reactive system behavior and to obtain accurate local approximations of the collision avoidance constraints (which are nonconvex). Our approach has the capacity to suppress high frequency chattering in the control signal in the presence of noise: a common drawback of aggressive control strategies. Experiment using two SCARA robots that share the same working environment is used to evaluate the presented approach."
icra,None,Cooperative redundant omnidirectional mobile manipulators: Model-free decentralized integral sliding modes and passive velocity fields,"A.-N. Ponce-Hinestroza,J.-A. Castro-Castro,H.-I. Guerrero-Reyes,,,","An omnidirectional mobile manipulator (OMM) provides extended capabilities to a robotic system since it enlarges its workspace at the expense of an omnidirectional mobile base, which is nowadays a reality. When various OMM transport an object, the resultant constrained OMM dynamics is quite complex that demands effective control schemes without neglecting dominant nonlinear effects nor interaction forces. In this paper, it is proposed a decentralized cooperative control for a set of k OMMs (k-OMM) subject to homogeneous holonomic constraints imposed by the object being manipulated. A chatterless integral sliding mode force-position control guarantees exponential tracking whose implementation does not require any knowledge of dynamics. This controller is decentralized in a sense that neither dynamics nor interaction forces of the i-OMM are required for the j-controller, and it is cooperative by correcting collectively the velocity deviation due to the pushing of the other j-OMM. Each omnidirectional base provides object mobility along passive smooth velocity fields to avoid obstacles on the floor, which is synthesized as the secondary task when resolving redundancy, and the force control stabilizes internal forces to ensure object grasp, which are declared together with end-effector position, as the primary task. Simulations are discussed for two 8-DoF Kuka youBot OMM system navigating in a cluttered environment."
icra,None,Robust two-degree-of-freedom iterative learning control for flexibility compensation of industrial robot manipulators,"Cong Wang,Minghui Zheng,Zining Wang,Masayoshi Tomizuka,","Most industrial robots are actuated using geared motors with no direct load side measurement. The flexibility introduced by the gear reducer causes transmission errors and vibrations, which limits the adoption of robot manipulators in many demanding applications. This paper presents a lean and efficient scheme of iterative learning control (ILC) to compensate for the joint flexibility of industrial robot manipulators. A two-degree-of-freedom ILC method is introduced. Compared with the dual-stage ILC that has been previously proposed for servo flexibility compensation, the method is more effective and also enables a leaner implementation. In addition, in order to handle system variation, a robust synthesis method is developed by using H∞ and μ techniques in an innovative way. The proposed method is analyzed using simulation studies as well as tested on an actual industrial robot manipulator."
icra,None,Fault tolerant control for omni-directional mobile platforms with 4 mecanum wheels,"Panagiotis Vlantis,Charalampos P. Bechlioulis,George Karras,George Fourlas,,","This paper addresses the fault tolerant control problem for an omni-directional mobile platform with four mecanum wheels moving on a well-known flat and constrained workspace with static obstacles. As a fault, we consider the case where a wheel cannot be actuated and hence it rotates freely around its drive shaft owing to the friction with the flat surface. Depending on the multitude of the faults, a robust motion control scheme is developed that achieves any desired configuration within the operational workspace, avoids collisions with the obstacles and does not violate the workspace boundaries despite the presence of dynamic model uncertainties. The challenge with respect to the current state of the art in fault tolerant control for such mobile platforms, where only one faulty wheel has been considered (i.e., the platform still retains its full actuation capabilities), lies in completely compensating up to two faulty wheels (i.e., the model becomes underactuated in this way) despite the dynamic model uncertainty and the presence of static obstacles in the workspace. Navigation Functions are innovatively incorporated with adaptive control techniques to deal with the parametric uncertainty in the robot dynamics, extending thus greatly the current state of the art in robust motion planning and collision avoidance by studying second order dynamics with parametric uncertainty. Finally, an extensive experimental study clarifies the proposed method and verifies its efficiency in various faults."
icra,None,Softbot: Software-based lead-through for rigid servo robots,"Yackov Lubarsky,Amit Wolf,Lior Wolf,Curime Batliner,Jake Newsum,","In this paper, we present an interactive control method for rigid robotics. The core of the method is a neural network classifier that maps position and torque readings to a force direction in 3D space. We show that running our method online allows a human to move the robot along a desired path by performing intuitive pushes and pulls on the robot's joints. The setup is sensorless: no additional sensors, other than those already integral to the rigid joint itself, are added to the manipulator or used in the process."
icra,None,Model-free joint torque control strategy for hydraulic robots,"Woongyong Lee,Min Jun Kim,Wan Kyun Chung,","This paper proposes a simple model-free joint torque control strategy for hydraulic robots. The undesirable effect called “natural velocity feedback effect” is discussed by introducing mechanical impedance of the system. The proposed model-free joint torque control consists of internal-loop control and external-loop control (2 degrees of freedom (DOF)). Based on a mechanically represented hydraulic robot joint, the first-order internal-loop control is designed to reduce the mechanical impedance of a hydraulic robot joint in a passive manner. To improve joint torque tracking performance, a simple proportional-integral-derivative external-loop control is applied to the modified system by the internal-loop control. Robustness to external disturbance is demonstrated by transforming the proposed 2DOF control structure to the disturbance observer form. The proposed joint torque control strategy is validated on a 1DOF rotary hydraulic robot joint."
icra,None,Torque evaluation method of spherical motors using six-axis force/torque sensor,"Masaaki Kumagai,","Spherical motors are classified as multi-degrees-of-freedom actuators. Several types of spherical motors are under investigation in the world because they will be useful for robots that currently use combination of 2 or 3 one-degree-of-freedom motors. However, most of the previous works mainly demonstrated how the motors rotate or how they output torque without giving enough specifications. Torque, velocity, efficiency, controllability, and response are important issues to determine how they can be used for robots or practical mechatronic systems. The objective of this paper is to propose a method to measure three-degrees-of-freedom torque of spherical motors while they rotate with arbitrary angular velocity, which can evaluate torque in practical situations and can be used to derive efficiency of the motor. These measurements are important for comparison among the implementations and improvement of the systems. The idea consists of two parts. One is torque measurement using a 6-axis force/torque sensor. It enables off-axis simultaneous measurement of torque. The other is an external 3-degrees-of-freedom rotor driver using wheels for omnidirectional mobile robots, which is installed between the rotor and the sensor. Detailed principles and a set of experimental measurements of our spherical induction motor demonstrating usefulness of the proposed method are described in this paper."
icra,None,Catching the wave: A transparency oriented wave based teleoperation architecture,"Cristian Secchi,Federica Ferraguti,Cesare Fantuzzi,","Wave variables are a very popular approach for dealing with communication delay in bilateral teleoperation because of their effectiveness and of their simplicity. Nevertheless, the inherent dynamics of wave based communication channels is often deleterious for the transparency of the teleoperation system. Recently proposed architectures like TDPN, PSPM and two layers approach allow to achieve a high transparency at the price of a complex architecture, with some parameters to tune empirically. In this paper we propose a novel wave based architecture that blends the high performance that can be achieved by recently proposed architectures with the simplicity of wave based bilateral teleoperation."
icra,None,Sweet pepper pose detection and grasping for automated crop harvesting,"Christopher Lehnert,Inkyu Sa,Christopher McCool,Ben Upcroft,,","This paper presents a method for estimating the 6DOF pose of sweet-pepper (capsicum) crops for autonomous harvesting via a robotic manipulator. The method uses the Kinect Fusion algorithm to robustly fuse RGB-D data from an eye-in-hand camera combined with a colour segmentation and clustering step to extract an accurate representation of the crop. The 6DOF pose of the sweet peppers is then estimated via a nonlinear least squares optimisation by fitting a superellipsoid to the segmented sweet pepper. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a real 6DOF manipulator with a custom gripper. The method is shown to estimate the 6DOF pose successfully enabling the manipulator to grasp sweet peppers for a range of different orientations. The results obtained improve largely on the performance of grasping when compared to a naive approach, which does not estimate the orientation of the crop."
icra,None,Single image based camera calibration and pose estimation of the end-effector of a robot,"R. A. Boby,S. K. Saha,","A new method is proposed for measurement of six dimensional pose of an industrial robot using a single image from a camera which is not pre-calibrated. Additionally during the pose determination, camera internal parameters are also obtained, which makes the method a suitable alternative for calibrating camera using a single image. Results from the two variants of the proposed approach are compared with Zhang's camera calibration algorithm and has been found to be better. Another utility of the proposed algorithm is to measure six dimensional pose of an industrial robot. Robot repeatability was also measured using the proposed camera calibration algorithm. The repeatability results were compared with the measurements using Artificial Reality toolkit ArUco which is a de-facto standard in the pose measurements using camera. The performance of the proposed method is better than that obtained from ArUco. Another area of application is identification of kinematic parameters. Using the circle point analysis method, identification of KUKA KR5 Arc robot was done using the proposed method."
icra,None,Real-time scalable 6DOF pose estimation for textureless objects,"Zhe Cao,Yaser Sheikh,Natasha Kholgade Banerjee,","Real-time recognition of the 6DOF pose of textureless objects is a fundamental and challenging problem in robotics. We present a novel approach to perform real-time estimation of the viewpoint, scale, and translation of an object in RGB and RGB-D image captures. In this work, we use a 3D model to render example poses of a textureless object, and find the nearest match to the input image using a GPU implementation. To achieve invariance to illumination and appearance across an object, we transform images to the Laplacian of Gaussian space. To perform real-time matching, we introduce a novel reshaping of the template set and the image, and we restructure the traditional normalized cross-correlation operation to leverage the GPU for fast matrix-matrix multiplication. We provide further speed up of large-scale template matching by contributing a dimensionality reduction approach using principal component analysis, and a candidate elimination method. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance as shown by qualitative results and quantitative comparisons to pre-existing methods."
icra,None,Reshaping our model of the world over time,"Marius Fehr,Marcin Dymczyk,Simon Lynen,Roland Siegwart,","An accurate estimate of the 3D-structure in the environment is key to robotic applications such as autonomous inspection, obstacle avoidance and manipulation. Recent years have seen substantial algorithmic advances towards creating highly accurate models of small objects as well as large scale architectural structures. Most commonly a rich set of images covering a static scene are used to jointly estimate the pose of the cameras and the observed 3D-structure. For many practical application however the assumption of static scenes and sufficient coverage by images does not hold. In fact for industrial inspection the change in the scene is of most interest and the limited resources on mobile platforms don't allow for extensive data captures. In this paper we investigate the potential of combining multiple independent captures of a place to selectively reconstruct a scene over time. We propose an incremental reconstruction algorithm which identifies and fuses novel data into a joint model of the scene. Being able to identify changing parts of the scene is particularly interesting for mobile applications where bandwidth, storage and processing power are limited. Through detailed experiments, we show the potential of our approach to use multiple mobile devices to reconstruct and update a model of the static part of the environment over time."

Our system is designed to reliably capture 3D information of a scene and objects and to be robust to challenging environment conditions. We also propose a depth-map upsampling method that produces an outliers-free depth map by explicitly handling depth outliers. Our system is suitable for robotic applications in which a robot interacts with the real-world, requiring accurate object detection and pose estimation. We evaluate our depth processing algorithm in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms on several synthetic and real-world datasets."
icra,None,Recognising the clothing categories from free-configuration using Gaussian-Process-based interactive perception,"Li Sun,Simon Rogers,Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa,J. Paul Siebert,","In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process-based interactive perception approach for recognising highly-wrinkled clothes. We have integrated this recognition method within a clothes sorting pipeline for the pre-washing stage of an autonomous laundering process. Our approach differs from reported clothing manipulation approaches by allowing the robot to update its perception confidence via numerous interactions with the garments. The classifiers predominantly reported in clothing perception (e.g. SVM, Random Forest) studies do not provide true classification probabilities, due to their inherent structure. In contrast, probabilistic classifiers (of which the Gaussian Process is a popular example) are able to provide predictive probabilities. In our approach, we employ a multi-class Gaussian Process classification using the Laplace approximation for posterior inference and optimising hyper-parameters via marginal likelihood maximisation. Our experimental results show that our approach is able to recognise unknown garments from highly-occluded and wrinkled configurations and demonstrates a substantial improvement over non-interactive perception approaches."
icra,None,A model-based approach to finding substitute tools in 3D vision data,"Paulo Abelha,Frank Guerin,Markus Schoeler,","A robot can feasibly be given knowledge of a set of tools for manipulation activities (e.g. hammer, knife, spatula). If the robot then operates outside a closed environment it is likely to face situations where the tool it knows is not available, but alternative unknown tools are present. We tackle the problem of finding the best substitute tool based solely on 3D vision data. Our approach has simple hand-coded models of known tools in terms of superquadrics and relationships among them. Our system attempts to fit these models to point clouds of unknown tools, producing a numeric value for how good a fit is. This value can be used to rate candidate substitutes. We explicitly control how closely each part of a tool must match our model, under direction from parameters of a target task. We allow bottom-up information from segmentation to dictate the sizes that should be considered for various parts of the tool. These ideas allow for a flexible matching so that tools may be superficially quite different, but similar in the way that matters. We evaluate our system's ratings relative to other approaches and relative to human performance in the same task. This is an approach to knowledge transfer, via a suitable representation and reasoning engine, and we discuss how this could be extended to transfer in planning."
icra,None,Watch-Bot: Unsupervised learning for reminding humans of forgotten actions,"Chenxia Wu,Jiemi Zhang,Bart Selman,Silvio Savarese,Ashutosh Saxena,","We present a robotic system that watches a human using a Kinect v2 RGB-D sensor, detects what he forgot to do while performing an activity, and if necessary reminds the person using a laser pointer to point out the related object. Our simple setup can be easily deployed on any assistive robot. Our approach is based on a learning algorithm trained in a purely unsupervised setting, which does not require any human annotations. This makes our approach scalable and applicable to variant scenarios. Our model learns the action/object co-occurrence and action temporal relations in the activity, and uses the learned rich relationships to infer the forgotten action and the related object. We show that our approach not only improves the unsupervised action segmentation and action cluster assignment performance, but also effectively detects the forgotten actions on a challenging human activity RGB-D video dataset. In robotic experiments, we show that our robot is able to remind people of forgotten actions successfully."
icra,None,Histogram of distances for local surface description,"Odysseas Kechagias-Stamatis,Nabil Aouf,","3D object recognition is proven superior compared to its 2D counterpart with numerous implementations, making it a current research topic. Local based proposals specifically, although being quite accurate, they limit their performance on the stability of their local reference frame or axis (LRF/A) on which the descriptors are defined. Additionally, extra processing time is demanded to estimate the LRF for each local patch. We propose a 3D descriptor which overrides the necessity of a LRF/A reducing dramatically processing time needed. In addition robustness to high levels of noise and non-uniform subsampling is achieved. Our approach, namely Histogram of Distances is based on multiple L2-norm metrics of local patches providing a simple and fast to compute descriptor suitable for time-critical applications. Evaluation on both high and low quality popular point clouds showed its promising performance."
icra,None,A distributed robotic vision service,"William Chamberlain,Jürgen Leitner,Tom Drummond,Peter Corke,","Robotic vision is limited by line of sight and on-board camera capabilities. Robots can acquire video or images from remote cameras, but processing additional data has a computational burden. This paper applies the Distributed Robotic Vision Service, DRVS, to robot path planning using data outside line-of-sight of the robot. DRVS implements a distributed visual object detection service to distributes the computation to remote camera nodes with processing capabilities. Robots request task-specific object detection from DRVS by specifying a geographic region of interest and object type. The remote camera nodes perform the visual processing and send the high-level object information to the robot. Additionally, DRVS relieves robots of sensor discovery by dynamically distributing object detection requests to remote camera nodes. Tested over two different indoor path planning tasks DRVS showed dramatic reduction in mobile robot compute load and wireless network utilization."

A novel image processing algorithm is proposed for autonomous detection of motor screws, to automate the task of motor disassembly. Instead of having a database of templates for matching, the screws are detected based on their characteristics with respect to its grayscale, depth and HSV values. Furthermore, with frame iterations, the accuracy of the system is increased mean while reducing its runtime. The algorithm is successfully tested and implemented and yields highly accurate results."
icra,None,Visual detection of occluded crop: For automated harvesting,"Christopher McCool,Inkyu Sa,Feras Dayoub,Christopher Lehnert,,,","This paper presents a novel crop detection system applied to the challenging task of field sweet pepper (capsicum) detection. The field-grown sweet pepper crop presents several challenges for robotic systems such as the high degree of occlusion and the fact that the crop can have a similar colour to the background (green on green). To overcome these issues, we propose a two-stage system that performs per-pixel segmentation followed by region detection. The output of the segmentation is used to search for highly probable regions and declares these to be sweet pepper. We propose the novel use of the local binary pattern (LBP) to perform crop segmentation. This feature improves the accuracy of crop segmentation from an AUC of 0.10, for previously proposed features, to 0.56. Using the LBP feature as the basis for our two-stage algorithm, we are able to detect 69.2% of field grown sweet peppers in three sites. This is an impressive result given that the average detection accuracy of people viewing the same colour imagery is 66.8%."
icra,None,Robust stereo visual odometry through a probabilistic combination of points and line segments,"Ruben Gomez-Ojeda,Javier Gonzalez-Jimenez,","Most approaches to stereo visual odometry reconstruct the motion based on the tracking of point features along a sequence of images. However, in low-textured scenes it is often difficult to encounter a large set of point features, or it may happen that they are not well distributed over the image, so that the behavior of these algorithms deteriorates. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to stereo visual odometry based on the combination of both point and line segment that works robustly in a wide variety of scenarios. The camera motion is recovered through non-linear minimization of the projection errors of both point and line segment features. In order to effectively combine both types of features, their associated errors are weighted according to their covariance matrices, computed from the propagation of Gaussian distribution errors in the sensor measurements. The method, of course, is computationally more expensive that using only one type of feature, but still can run in real-time on a standard computer and provides interesting advantages, including a straightforward integration into any probabilistic framework commonly employed in mobile robotics."
icra,None,Augmented dictionary learning for motion prediction,"Yu Fan Chen,Miao Liu,Jonathan P. How,","Developing accurate models and efficient representations of multivariate trajectories is important for understanding the behavior patterns of mobile agents. This work presents a dictionary learning algorithm for developing a part-based trajectory representation, which combines merits of the existing Markovian-based and clustering-based approaches. In particular, this work presents the augmented semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC) algorithm for solving a constrained dictionary learning problem, and shows that the proposed method would converge to a local optimum given a convexity condition. We consider a trajectory modeling application, in which the learned dictionary atoms correspond to local motion patterns. Classical semi-nonnegative sparse coding approaches would add dictionary atoms with opposite signs to reduce the representational error, which can lead to learning noisy dictionary atoms that correspond poorly to local motion patterns. ASNSC addresses this problem and learns a concise set of intuitive motion patterns. ASNSC shows significant improvement over existing trajectory modeling methods in both prediction accuracy and computational time, as revealed by extensive numerical analysis on real datasets."
icra,None,A multistage controller with smooth switching for Autonomous Pallet Picking,"Mohammad M. Aref,Reza Ghabcheloo,Antti Kolu,Jouni Mattila,","This paper addresses the problem of pallet picking by an Articulated-Frame-Steering (AFS) hydraulic machine. We propose a macro-micro visual mobile manipulation architecture, where a smooth switching logic navigates the robot to pick an object. The state space is divided into several regions depending on the accuracy of the vision and robot's degrees of freedom. The control architecture benefits from the following phenomena: at distance, when the location of the object of interest is detected, its orientation may not be reliably estimated; at some closer distances, orientations also become available; and because pallets are wide with small height, yaw angle estimation are more accurate than pitch is. The switching logic is devised to control the corresponding degree of freedom of the mobile manipulator in each region. Moreover, in different regions, we employ different coordinate frames, namely an earth-fixed frame or an object-local frame, which is more natural for the problem in that region. We show that the architecture accomplishes the following: 1) it eliminates the need for replanning as the accuracy of pose estimation improves; and 2) it provides the mobile base with a longer corridor to steer toward the pallet and align its heading. We also incorporate a robust, accurate solution based on fiducial markers for object manipulation in unstructured outdoor environments and unfavorable weather conditions, which relies solely on a monocular camera for pallet detection. The presented experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the method, as the model starts following the target even when the pallet is still 6m away from the vehicle."

Assuming approximately rational behavior, and incorporating environmental constraints and biases, including time-varying ones imposed by traffic lights, we model intent as a policy in a Markov decision process framework. We infer pedestrian state using a Rao-Blackwellized filter, and intent by planning according to a stochastic policy, reflecting individual preferences in aiming at the same goal."
icra,None,Robust homing for autonomous robots,"Igor Bogoslavskyi,Mladen Mazuran,Cyrill Stachniss,","In autonomous exploration tasks, robots usually rely on a SLAM system to build a map of the environment online and then use it for navigation purposes. Although there has been substantial progress in robustly building accurate maps, these systems cannot guarantee the consistency of the resulting environment model. In this paper, we address the problem of robustly guiding a robot back to its starting location after exploring an unknown environment-even if the mapping system fails to produce a consistent map. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, we check if the current map is consistent using a statistical test. If the map is consistent, we navigate the robot back to its starting location using a standard navigation system. In case of an inconsistent map, however, we propose to rewind the trajectory from the current location to the start without relying on a map. We implemented the proposed system in ROS and showcase its effectiveness on an autonomous exploration robot in real underground and office environments."
icra,None,First applications of sound-based control on a mobile robot equipped with two microphones,"Aly Magassouba,Nancy Bertin,François Chaumette,","This paper validates experimentally a novel approach to robot audition, sound-based control, which consists in introducing auditory features directly as inputs of a closed-loop control scheme, that is, without any explicit localization process. The applications we present rely on the implicit bearings of the sound sources computed from the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between two microphones. By linking the motion of the robot to the aural perception of the environment, this approach has the benefit of being more robust to reverberation and noise. Therefore neither complex tracking method such as Kalman filtering nor TDOA enhancement with denoising or dereverberation methods are needed to track the correct TDOA measurements. The experiments conducted on a mobile robot instrumented with a pair of microphones show the validity of our approach. In a reverberating and noisy room, this approach is able to orient the robot to a mobile sound source in real time. A positioning task with respect to two sound sources is also performed while the robot perception is disturbed by altered and spurious TDOA measurements."

Airborne monitoring in agriculture can a substantially impacts on the identification of diseases and produce accurate information on affected areas. The problem can be formulated as a classification task on aerial images with significant opportunities to impact other fields. This paper presents an active learning method through route planning for improvements in the knowledge on visited areas and minimization uncertainties about the classification of diseases in crops. Binary Logistic Regression and Gaussian Process were used for the detection of pathologies and map interpolation, respectively. A Bayesian optimization strategy is also proposed for the planning of an informative trajectory, which resulted in a maximized search for affected areas in an initially unknown environment."

This paper incorporates two fields of study: slip estimation and motion planning. For slip estimation, an experimental result from [9] is used to model the effect of the slip on the vehicle in various soil types. For motion planning, a robust incremental sampling based motion planning algorithm (CC-RRT*) is combined with the LQG-MP algorithm. CC-RRT* yields the optimal and probabilistically feasible trajectory by using a chance constrained approach under the RRT* framework. LQG-MP provides the capability of considering the role of compensator in the motion planning phase and bounds the degree of uncertainty to appropriate size. In simulation, the planner successfully finds the optimal and robust solution. In addition, the planner is compared with an RRT* algorithm with dilated obstacles to show that it avoids being overly conservative."
icra,None,Any-time path-planning: Time-varying wind field + moving obstacles,"Michael Otte,William Silva,Eric Frew,","We consider the problem of real-time path-planning in a spatiotemporally varying wind-field with moving obstacles. We are provided with changing wind and obstacle predictions along a (D + 1)-dimensional space-time lattice. We present an Any-Time algorithm that quickly finds an αβ-suboptimal solution (a path that is not longer than αβ times the optimal time-length), and then improves α and β while planning time remains or until new wind/obstacle predictions trigger a restart. The factor α comes from an α-overestimate of the A*-like cost heuristic. β is proportional to motion modeling error. Any-Time performance is achieved by: (1) improving the connectivity model of the environment from a discrete graph to a continuous cost-field (decreasing β); (2) using the established method of incrementally deflating α. Our method was deployed as the global planner on a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system that uses Doppler radar and atmospheric models for online real-time wind sensing and prediction. We compare its performance vs. other state-of-the-art methods in simulated environments."
icra,None,Active sensing data collection with autonomous mobile robots,"Richard Wang,Manuela Veloso,Srinivasan Seshan,","With the introduction of autonomous robots that help perform various tasks in our environments, we can opportunistically use them for collecting fine-grain sensor measurements about our surroundings. Use of mobile robots for data collection scales much better than static sensors in terms of number of measurement locations and provide more fine-grain accuracy and reliability than alternate human crowd-sourcing efforts. One of the unique features of mobile robots is the ability to control and direct where and when measurements should be collected. In this paper, we present a system to compute paths for the robot to follow that incorporates the robot's limited expected deployment time, expected measurement value at each location, and a history of when each location was last visited."
icra,None,Cluster-based loop closing detection for underwater slam in feature-poor regions,"Pep Lluis Negre,Francisco Bonin-Font,Gabriel Oliver,","This paper reports on a novel technique to visually detect loop closings in feature-poor underwater environments in order to increase the accuracy of vision-based localization systems. The main problem of the classical visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for underwater vehicles is the lack of robust, stable and matchable features in certain aquatic environments. The presence of sandbanks, seagrass or other underwater phenomena cause the visual features to concentrate in regions heavily textured, leaving great image areas completely free of visual information. In this situation, the classical loop closing detection algorithms fail, resulting in no corrections for the SLAM system. Our novel method proposes to reinforce the loop closing detection by clustering visual keypoints present in multiple keyframes and to match features of clusters instead of features of keyframes. This new technique is assessed on the particular application of navigating an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in marine environments colonized with seagrass or with the presence of sandbanks. Experiments conducted in several coastal zones on the Balearic Islands show a high degree of success in the visual registration of overlapping areas."
icra,None,Neural-based underwater surface localization through electrolocation,"Yannick Morel,Vincent Lebastard,Frédéric Boyer,","By manipulation of electric fields, it is possible to detect the presence of foreign objects underwater. The presented work builds upon a previous result, in which was developed a neural network-based methodology allowing to address this detection problem for spherical objects. Hereafter, we show that the approach generalizes to the case of continuous walls. The technique relies on a neural model of the forward map (from scene configuration to electric measures). Exploiting this model, together with collected electric measures, it becomes possible to detect and infer the relative distance and orientation of a planar wall. In addition, we show that relying on a single forward model, only descriptive of the presence of a single wall, it is possible to address the same problem in presence of a combination of walls forming a corner or a corridor. Closing the motion control loop with information obtained using the proposed approach, it becomes possible to regulate position of a system at a fixed distance and orientation from a wall, with applications to the exploration and monitoring of flooded pipelines, or to surface quality monitoring of ships' hulls (in relation to biofouling). Data collected experimentally are used together with analytical models and numerical simulations to illustrate efficacy of the approach."
icra,None,Adaptive underwater sonar surveys in the presence of strong currents,"David P. Williams,Francesco Baralli,Michele Micheli,Simone Vasoli,","We consider the task of conducting underwater surveys with a sonar-equipped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in environments with strong currents. More specifically, this topic is addressed in the context of mine countermeasure operations employing synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) sensors. Two complementary algorithms that allow the AUV to autonomously adapt its survey route based on sophisticated sensor data it collects in situ, while respecting the unique constraints imposed by the problem, are proposed. The algorithms allow the AUV to (i) adapt its survey heading based on the presence of currents to ensure quality data is collected, and (ii) adapt its survey route to reinspect the most suspicious objects at additional aspects. The flexibility to immediately react in situ to the environmental and tactical conditions sensed during the mission allow the most useful data for object recognition purposes to be collected efficiently. By obviating the recovery and redeployment of the AUV, as well as laboratory-based data-processing during the interregnum, the overall mission timeline can be greatly compressed and operational costs can be reduced. Experimental results illustrating the real-time execution of the proposed algorithms on an AUV are shown for a completely autonomous mission conducted in the North Sea."
icra,None,Underwater Vehicles attitude estimation in presence of magnetic disturbances,"Benedetto Allotta,Riccardo Costanzi,Francesco Fanelli,Niccolò Monni,,","An accurate orientation estimation is a primary requirement in autonomous navigation tasks of mobile robots, especially when such operation is involved in the solution of the position estimation problem (e.g. dead reckoning navigation systems). This is the case of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), subject of this paper; for this class of robots, a complete attitude estimation system based on the adaptation of a Nonlinear Complementary Filter (NCF) is proposed. The presented filter fuses the measurements of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) comprising magnetometers. The integration of a single-axis Fibre Optic Gyroscope (FOG) is evaluated to overcome issues due to magnetic disturbances. In addition, a calibration procedure for magnetometers to be exploited within the attitude estimation filter is proposed. The whole system has been experimentally validated and tested on the University of Florence Typhoon AUV; the results prove that the proposed approach allows to obtain a reliable orientation estimate even in the presence of external unpredictable disturbances."
icra,None,Preliminary study of cooperative navigation of underwater vehicles without a DVL utilizing range and range-rate observations,"Zachary J. Harris,Louis L. Whitcomb,","This paper reports a preliminary study of a method for combined underwater communication and navigation of underwater vehicles (cooperative navigation) equipped with an acoustic modem, attitude, and depth sensors, but lacking a Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a surface vehicle equipped with an acoustic modem and GPS. Few previously reported studies have utilized acoustic range rate in addition to acoustic range for the general navigation of underwater vehicles. This paper reports an observation model for range-rate measurements and preliminary anecdotal simulation studies for cooperative navigation of one underwater vehicle client with one surface vehicle server employing both range and range-rate observations to estimate the vehicle states with a delayed-state extended Kalman filter in the absence of DVL velocity observations. The preliminary studies suggest that the addition of range-rate measurements may offer advantages over the case of range-only observations in a limited set of circumstances, such as poor range-observation accuracy. The present study is preliminary, however, and directions for future study are suggested."
icra,None,Online fault detection and model adaptation for Underwater Vehicles in the case of thruster failures,"Georgios Fagogenis,Valerio De Carolis,David M. Lane,","Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are required to carry out a mission with minimum supervision. Often, the AUV's hardware integrity is compromised amidst operation; thus, jeopardising the mission's success. Thruster failures, for example, may affect AUVs locomotion. Following a thruster failure, the plan may require changes to compensate, if possible, for the loss of mobility. In this paper, we present an algorithm that identifies thruster failures in run-time. Moreover, the algorithm corrects the vehicle's dynamical model to incorporate the defective thruster. The algorithm uses a Mixture of Gaussians representation for the vehicle's state. Variational Bayes Approximation has been utilised to yield the filtering equations. As indicated by experimental evaluation, the algorithm detects thruster-failure events correctly; and, in turn, learns an accurate dynamical model of the vehicle at its current state. Experiments were carried out on a real platform in a wave tank at Heriot-Watt University."
icra,None,3D underwater localization scheme using EM wave attenuation with a depth sensor,"Daegil Park,Kyungmin Kwak,Jinhyun Kim,Wan Kyun Chung,","Previously, we proposed a scheme that determines the position of a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) from the signal strengths of commercial radio-frequency sensors and antennas. This scheme provides accurate position information in a structured environment but is limited to two-dimensional (2D) environments because the radiation power of the antenna depends on the elevation angle between the sending and receiving antennas. To overcome this problem, we propose a 3D localization scheme that considers the electromagnetic (EM) wave attenuation over the range of reliable elevation angles. In order to determine the reliable elevation scope, we analyzed the radiation patterns of dipole antennas. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated in distance estimation and 3D localization experiments by varying the distance and elevation angle. Encouraged by these results, we constructed an underwater wireless sensor network in the experimental basin, and performed ROV position tracking with the depth sensor. The scheme achieved reliable localization accuracy at a fast sampling rate, demonstrating the feasibility of exploiting EM wave attenuation in localization."
icra,None,AUV behaviors for collection of bistatic and multistatic acoustic scattering data from seabed targets,"Erin M. Fischell,Henrik Schmidt,","Characterization of seabed targets using networks of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is of great interest for harbor security. The imaging sensors generally used for target localization and classification are expensive for outfitting multiple AUVs and produce data that is difficult to use for real-time onboard classification. An approach to this problem has been developed in which an acoustic source insonifies targets and AUVs with inexpensive hydrophone nose arrays are used to sample the resulting scattered fields. These scattered fields consist of distinctive radiation patterns, where the amplitude sampled by a receiving AUV for a particular target is determined by source frequency, aspect angle between source and target, and bistatic angle between source and receiver. AUV behaviors were developed to control the bistatic angles relative to a localized target between source and receiver vehicles and aspect angle between a target and the source. Two configurations were explored: bistatic, where the source is fixed and receiver moving, and multistatic, where both source and receiver are located on mobile autonomous vehicles. Design considerations for behaviors to sample different combinations of bistatic angle and aspect angle included keeping receiving arrays broadside to a target for uniform-quality data collection and obeying vehicle dynamics constraints. Behaviors for the bistatic configuration were demonstrated in AUV experiments, and behaviors for the multistatic case were demonstrated in simulation, including collaboration between source and receiver vehicles for controlling bistatic versus aspect angle."
icra,None,Anomaly detection in unstructured environments using Bayesian nonparametric scene modeling,"Yogesh Girdhar,Walter Cho,Matthew Campbell,Jesus Pineda,Elizabeth Clarke,,","This paper explores the use of a Bayesian nonparametric topic modeling technique for the purpose of anomaly detection in video data. We present results from two experiments. The first experiment shows that the proposed technique is automatically able characterize the underlying terrain, and detect anomalous flora in image data collected by an underwater robot. The second experiment shows that the same technique can be used on images from a static camera in a dynamic unstructured environment. In the second dataset, consisting of video data from a static seafloor camera capturing images of a busy coral reef, the proposed technique was able to detect all three instances of an underwater vehicle passing in front of the camera, amongst many other observations of fishes, debris, lighting changes due to surface waves, and benthic flora."
icra,None,The efficacy of interaction behavior and internal stiffness control for embodied information gain in haptic perception,"Nantachai Sornkarn,Thrishantha Nanayakkara,","Haptic perception in biological systems not only depends on the environmental conditions, but also on the behavioral state and the internal impedance of the embodiment because proprioceptive sensors are embedded in the muscle and tendons used for actuation. A simple example of such a phenomenon can be found when people are asked to palpate a soft tissue to identify a stiff-inclusion. People tend to perform a variety of palpation strategies depending on their previous knowledge and the desired information. Does this mean that the probing behavioral variables and internal muscle impedance parameters and their interaction with given environmental conditions play a role in the perception information gain during the estimation of soft tissue's properties? In this paper, we use a two-degree of freedom laboratory-made variable stiffness and indentation probe to investigate how the modulation of probing behavioral and internal stiffness variables can affect the accuracy of the depth estimation of stiff inclusions in artificial silicon phantom tissue using information gain metrics based on prior knowledge in form of memory primitives."
icra,None,Haptic simulation of an automotive automatic gearshift: Stability analysis and design of force profiles with hysteresis,"Domenico Chiaradia,Massimiliano Solazzi,Diego Caporali,Massimiliano Russo,,,","This paper presents the development and the experimental validation of a controller for the simulation of the behavior of automotive automatic gearshifts. For this purpose a gearshift simulator was developed based on 2 DOF haptic interface to evaluate users qualitative judgment of automatic gearshifts response. In fact, many car manufacturers use vehicle and primary controls simulators to evaluate the characteristics of a new model before building physical mock-ups or even prototypes. A dedicated control law was designed in order to reproduce different experimentally measured force profiles during forward and backward run of the gearshift handle. The force feedback control law was based on an impedance model with different stiffness values along the path of the gearshift. A state machine selects the characteristics of the force feedback profile according to lever position and velocity. An additional state machine implements the hysteresis behavior of the force profiles by a transition function. The transition algorithm and constraints related to stability are discussed in this paper. The rendered force/position profiles were obtained from experimental data using a real gearshift. Several gearshift response profiles were tested and simulated and experimental results were compared and highlighted good fidelity in force reproduction."
icra,None,Passivity and practical considerations for the SNMF System,"Ryder C. Winck,Wayne J. Book,","Systems comprised of many subsystems can benefit from reducing the number of inputs. Pin array shape displays are one example where this is particularly true. Many pin arrays use a row-column structure, as found on LCD screens, to reduce the number of inputs. However, reducing inputs in this manner makes simultaneous control of the pins challenging. Using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to reduce the rank of the inputs solves this problem, but there has not yet been a method to analyze the stability of the resulting system. Additionally, the application of the SNMF System to pin arrays, particularly those using fluid power, presents many practical challenges. This paper proves that the SNMF rank-one approximation is strictly-output passive, leading to approaches to analyze the stability of the SNMF System. We also address practical challenges by showing that the SNMF System improves performance over the previous approach, line scanning, even in the presence of power limitations and by examining the effects of row and column dynamics and proposing approaches to limit these negative effects."
icra,None,Unsupervised feature learning for classifying dynamic tactile events using sparse coding,"Jean-Philippe Roberge,Samuel Rispal,Tony Wong,Vincent Duchaine,","Robotic operations that involve the displacement of objects generate different kinds of dynamic events. These may simply correspond to normal robot-related motion, or contact(s) with the object(s) during grasping, but they may also be potentially-problematic events like slippage. In this paper, we use sparse data from tactile sensors to detect slippage and discriminate object-gripper slip from object-world slip. The method we propose can also identify vibrations that correspond to other dynamic events automatically, even when those events are not related to slippage. The tactile data can then be classified, allowing the robot to react accordingly. To achieve this goal, we compute the power spectral density (PSD) of the tactile dynamic signal, and we apply transformations to the PSD that were inspired by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) field. The originality of this work comes from using a sparse representation of the transformed data to obtain sparse vectors containing a small set of high-level features. Those sparse vectors are then used as inputs to a simple linear support vector machine (SVM), that acts as a classifier and quickly estimates the event to which they correspond. Our method was tested on data obtained from 244 experiments that were conducted on 32 different everyday-objects. Results show that we can successfully discriminate most of the dynamic events we studied in this work. Moreover, by using this technique, we are able to detect slippage with an accuracy of 92.60% and to differentiate object-gripper slip from object-world slip with a success rate of 89.42%."
icra,None,User's task performance in two-handed complementary-motion teleoperation,"Maëlle Agbalé,Renz Ocampo,Mahdi Tavakoli,","Despite recent advances to improve transparency of teleoperation systems, certain tasks remain difficult and time-consuming when performed via teleoperation. Operators are often required to perform tasks involving multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) requiring great dexterity. To be fully adopted, the speed and ease of teleoperated task performance must be increased. A possibility is to use cooperative manipulation, namely two-handed teleoperation, to allow the two hands of the user to manipulate two master haptic devices in order to control a slave robot with multiple DOFs; the total DOFs of the two masters are equal to the DOFs of the slave. We present the results of a user study that evaluates the performance of a bimanual teleoperation system involving two 3-DOF haptic master interfaces to control a 6-DOF slave manipulator. The two master's motions are complementary. Then, we compare this performance to a single-master/single-slave teleoperation system using 6-DOF master and slave manipulators. In order to compare the users' performance in the two systems, a 6-DOF task experiment is considered. The task performed resembles typical tasks carried out in surgery. The results of our study suggest that DOF decomposition leads to significant improvements regarding task completion time and trajectory tracking for a task which involves following a pattern while maintaining a desired depth."
icra,None,Development and experimental validation of a minimalistic shape-changing haptic navigation device,"Adam J. Spiers,Janet van Der Linden,Maria Oshodi,Aaron M. Dollar,","This paper presents a minimalistic handheld haptic interface designed to provide pedestrian navigation assistance via the intuitive and unobtrusive stimulus of shape-changing. The new device, named the Haptic Taco, explores a novel region of robotic interfaces which we believe to have benefits over other communication methods. In previous work, we demonstrated the use of a 2DOF shape changing interface for navigation without the use of sight. In this paper we seek to explore the potential of minimal 1DOF interfaces, whose simplicity may increase intuitiveness and performance despite conveying less information. The Haptic Taco utilizes the same `variable volume' concept as a previous device, the Haptic Lotus (2010), but with reduced body compliance and higher force exertion capability. Both devices modulate their perceived volume in relation to proximity to a navigational target (a destination or waypoint). As users walk within an environment, they also attempt to minimize the device volume, finding targets via an embodied `steepest descent' method. Experimental comparison of the Lotus and Taco in a target-finding study revealed that the Taco interface increased motion path efficiency by 24% over the Lotus, to 47% average efficiency. This result is highly comparable to the mean motion efficiency of 43.6-48% observed in prior experiments with the 2DOF shape-changing interface, the Animotus. The findings indicate the potential for minimalistic interfaces in this emerging field."
icra,None,A novel haptic device with high-force display capability and wide workspace,"Giuk Lee,Sung-moon Hur,Yonghwan Oh,","This paper presents a novel haptic device, named VirtuaPower, having abilities of 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) position measurement with a high-force display capability and wide workspace. The VirtuaPower is designed as a parallel mechanism with double in-parallel supporting chains. The mechanical design is presented with constraints and space Jacobians. The workspace and force display capability are computed via kinematic analysis. The VirtuaPower has a wide workspace up to 1 m3 (semicylinder, diameter 1.8 m × height 1.0 m). Moreover, the force display capability is enhanced compared to any existing haptic device, i.e., approximately 100 N of linear force and 10 Nm of torque. The force display ability is validated by an experiment with a 6 DOF force/torque sensor. Finally, a simple virtual reality environment is experientially realized with the VirtuaPower to show its utility as a haptic device."
icra,None,A unified representation to interact with simulated deformable objects in virtual environments,"Davide Zerbato,Paolo Fiorini,","Deformations are an essential aspect of our interaction with real bodies, prompting the development of many modelling and simulation methods for virtual environments. Some of the methods address specific classes of interaction, e.g. pushing, grabbing, cutting or needle insertion, whereas hybrid approaches have been proposed to deal with more complex scenarios. However, a general strategy to combine different simulation methods is still not available. This paper presents a unified approach to combine different methods, each optimised for a specific interaction and object type. Our approach is tailored to the needs of simulating haptic Human-Robot Interactions and allows abstracting from the implementation details of different methods for modelling deformable objects. It has been integrated with collision detection and friction models, ported to a graphic processing unit (GPU), and demonstrated with realistic simulations and experiments."
icra,None,Closed-loop shape control of a Haptic Jamming deformable surface,"Andrew A. Stanley,Kenji Hata,Allison M. Okamura,","A Haptic Jamming tactile display, consisting of an array of thin particle jamming cells, can change its shape and mechanical properties simultaneously through a combination of vacuuming individual cells, pressurizing the air chamber beneath the surface, and pinning the nodes between the cells at various heights. In previous particle jamming devices for haptics and soft robotics, shape has typically been commanded open-loop or manipulated directly by a human user. A new algorithm was designed for the three types of actuation inputs for a Haptic Jamming surface, using the depth map provided by an RGB-D sensor as shape feedback for closed-loop control to match a desired surface input. To test the closed-loop control accuracy of the system, a mass-spring model of the Haptic Jamming device generated three unique surface shapes as desired inputs into the controller with a mean height range of 25.1 mm. The average correlation coefficient between the desired input shape and the experimental output generated by the controller on the actual device across four trials for each shape was 0.88, with an average height error of 2.7 mm. When the desired input surface is generated from a 3D model of an object that a Haptic Jamming surface cannot necessarily re-create, the difference between the input and the output increases substantially. However, simulation of a larger array suggests that a Haptic Jamming surface can provide a compelling match for these more complicated shapes."
icra,None,Reduced dynamical equations for barycentric spherical robots,"Matt Burkhardt,Joel W. Burdick,","Barycentric spherical robots (BSRs) rely on a noncollocated center of mass and center of rotation for propulsion. Unique challenges inherent to BSRs include a nontrivial correlation between internal actuation, momentum, and net vehicle motion. A new method is presented for deriving reduced dynamical equations of motion (EOM) for a general class of BSRs which extends and synthesizes prior efforts in geometric mechanics. Our method is an extension of the BKMM approach [1], allowing Lagrangian reduction and reconstruction to be applied to dynamical systems with symmetry-breaking potential energies, such as those encountered by BSRs rolling on a surface. The resulting dynamical equations are of minimal dimension and vehicle motion due to actuation and momenta appear linearly in a simple first-order differential equation. The EOM of a BSR named Moball [2] [3] are derived to illustrate the approach's utility. A simple table summarizes our algorithm's application to popular BSRs in the literature, and the approach is extended to sloped terrains."
icra,None,Development and experimental validation of a reorientation algorithm for a free-floating serial manipulator,"Jean-Alexandre Bettez-Bouchard,Clément Gosselin,","This paper presents a method to reorient a free-floating serial manipulator using internal motion based on a path planning algorithm using a dynamic model of the manipulator and a potential function. Simulations with the proposed algorithm are performed using a nonlinear optimization technique in order to determine the actuator's velocity trajectories that achieve the reorientation. An example trajectory is presented in which a three-link planar robot starts from a pose in which all the links are aligned and ends with the same joint configuration but with the robot having completed a 180 degrees rotation. For this example, the algorithm finds trajectories that allow the robot to complete approximately 94% of the reorientation. To verify the simulation results against a real robot, a prototype of a planar robot with three bodies and two revolute joints is built. The experiments conducted show that the prototype is able to achieve the prescribed reorientation, even though the control of the orientation was implemented in an open-loop mode."
icra,None,Motion planning for a hoop-pendulum type of underactuated systems,"Yang Bai,Mikhail Svinin,Motoji Yamamoto,","This paper deals with motion planning and control for an underactuated system, the hoop-pendulum, a pendulum mounted at the center of a hoop. The dynamic model for this system is derived and the local controllability around the equilibrium point is established. To transfer the system from a initial configuration to a desired final configuration in rest-to-rest mode, two controllers, the feedback and feedforward ones, are constructed. The feedback controller stabilizes the system at the origin and is based on the construction of a suitable Lyapunov function. The feedforward controller is based on the representation of the motion of the pendulum by the second derivative of Beta function. The feasibility and the performance of the proposed controllers are verified under simulations."
icra,None,A*-Connect: Bounded suboptimal bidirectional heuristic search,"Fahad Islam,Venkatraman Narayanan,Maxim Likhachev,","The benefits of bidirectional planning over the unidirectional version are well established for motion planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces. While bidirectional approaches have been employed with great success in the context of sampling-based planners such as in RRT-Connect, they have not enjoyed popularity amongst search-based methods such as A*. The systematic nature of search-based algorithms, which often leads to consistent and high-quality paths, also enforces strict conditions for the connection of forward and backward searches. Admissible heuristics for the connection of forward and backward searches have been developed, but their computational complexity is a deterrent. In this work, we leverage recent advances in search with inadmissible heuristics to develop an algorithm called A*-Connect, much in the spirit of RRT-Connect. A*-Connect uses a fast approximation of the classic front-to-front heuristic from literature to lead the forward and backward searches towards each other, while retaining theoretical guarantees on completeness and bounded suboptimality. We validate A*-Connect on manipulation as well as navigation domains, comparing with popular sampling-based methods as well as state-of-the-art bidirectional search algorithms. Our results indicate that A*-Connect can provide several times speedup over unidirectional search while maintaining high solution quality."
icra,None,Planning motions for a planar robot attached to a stiff tether,"Reza H. Teshnizi,Dylan A. Shell,","There are several practical reasons to endow a mobile robot with a tether, but doing so adds considerable complexity to the problem of moving the robot. The feasibility of a particular motion in such systems depends on topological constraints imposed by the interplay of the robot's tether and its environment. The physical properties of the tether may also rule out configurations that would be possible otherwise. Little work has addressed these latter constraints, despite the considerable interest in motion planning for tethered robots recently. We examine the problem of planning motions of a planar robot connected via a cable of limited length to a fixed point in ℝ2 when the tether has a constraint on its curvature, which adds appreciably to the realism of the cable model over existing work. We incorporate Dubins's theory of curves with work on planning with topological constraints to concisely represent the configuration space manifold, leading to an atlas of the manifold consisting of locally continuous charts that represent the cable's curvature limits conveniently. Any configuration of the tether and the robot is described in our representation with two elements: (1) a discrete structure that characterizes the cable's position and (2) an element within a single continuous chart. We provide an algorithm that explores the necessary parts of this atlas on-the-fly to locate paths efficiently."
icra,None,RRT-based nonholonomic motion planning using any-angle path biasing,"Luigi Palmieri,Sven Koenig,Kai O. Arras,","RRT and RRT* have become popular planning techniques, in particular for high-dimensional systems such as wheeled robots with complex nonholonomic constraints. Their planning times, however, can scale poorly for such robots, which has motivated researchers to study hierarchical techniques that grow the RRT trees in more focused ways. Along this line, we introduce Theta*-RRT that hierarchically combines (discrete) any-angle search with (continuous) RRT motion planning for nonholonomic wheeled robots. Theta*-RRT is a variant of RRT that generates a trajectory by expanding a tree of geodesics toward sampled states whose distribution summarizes geometric information of the any-angle path. We show experimentally, for both a differential drive system and a high-dimensional truck-and-trailer system, that Theta*-RRT finds shorter trajectories significantly faster than four baseline planners (RRT, A*-RRT, RRT*, A*-RRT*) without loss of smoothness, while A*-RRT* and RRT* (and thus also Informed RRT*) fail to generate a first trajectory sufficiently fast in environments with complex nonholonomic constraints. We also prove that Theta*-RRT retains the probabilistic completeness of RRT for all small-time controllable systems that use an analytical steer function."
icra,None,Random Inspection Tree Algorithm in visual inspection with a realistic sensing model and differential constraints,"Přemysl Kafka,Jan Faigl,Petr Váňa,","In this paper, we consider existing asymptotically optimal inspection planning algorithm in coverage path planning with realistic visibility constraints of standard cameras. Although the existing approach is able to provide an optimal solution with omnidirectional sensing and limited sensing range, it is prohibitively computationally expensive for problems with only few objects to be covered and limited field of view. Based on the analysis of the utilized sampling-based strategy, we propose a heuristic approach to decrease computational requirements in problems with restricted viewing frustum, which is a more realistic model of a digital camera. In addition, we also consider a minimal distance and angle under which the object to be covered is captured by the forward looking camera to make a snapshot of the object with the required details."
icra,None,The Stochastic Traveling Salesman Problem and Orienteering for kinodynamic vehicles,"Aviv Adler,Sertac Karaman,","In the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the objective is to find the shortest path that visits a set of target locations. This problem is embedded and essential in many planning problems that arise in robotics, particularly in the domains of exploration, monitoring, surveillance, and reconnaissance. In this paper we consider the Stochastic TSP for Dynamical Systems, where a vehicle with complex dynamics is tasked with visiting n random target locations. By borrowing techniques from the applied probability literature, which were used to study the related stochastic Orienteering problem (where the vehicle has to visit as many of the n points as possible with a path of fixed length), we simplify and extend the existing results for both the TSP and the stochastic Orienteering problems to cases where the target points can be picked up only when the vehicle is in a certain configuration (i.e. it is not enough simply to be on the target point). Specifically, we show that there is a special parameter γ of the dynamics of the vehicle, which governs the length of the TSP tour. The length of the shortest path will then be Θ(n(γ-1)/γ) with very high probability. For stochastic Orienteering, if the path must have length at most λ, the vehicle can pick up Θ(λn1/γ) with very high probability. We also provide simple and efficient path planning algorithms which achieve these bounds, and are therefore within a constant factor of the length of the optimal path with very high probability."
icra,None,Human-robot collaborative high-level control with application to rescue robotics,"Philipp Schillinger,Stefan Kohlbrecher,Oskar von Stryk,","Motivated by the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), the application of operator assisted (semi-)autonomous robots with highly complex locomotion and manipulation abilities is considered for solving complex tasks in potentially unknown and unstructured environments. Because of the limited a priori knowledge about the state of the environment and tasks needed to achieve a complex mission, a sufficiently complete a priori design of high level robot behaviors is not possible. Most of the situational knowledge required for such behavior design is gathered only during runtime and needs to be interpreted by a human operator. However, current behavior control approaches only allow for very limited adaptation at runtime and no flexible operator interaction. In this paper an approach for definition and execution of complex robot behaviors based on hierarchical state machines is presented, allowing to flexibly change the structure of behaviors on the fly during runtime through assistance of a remote operator. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated not only in an example scenario, but also by application in two robot competitions."

The tensioning residual values of the 58 studs are monitored for procedure evaluation. It is time-consuming for human operators to place the measurement meters into working positions. In order to reduce labor intensity and eliminate radiation exposure time, we develop a robot-assisted automatic measurement system to achieve meter placement and real-time data monitoring. The Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based distributed control scheme realizes high-speed data acquisition and coordinated control of the 58 node robots.

icra,None,Verification of gait control based on reaction null-space for ground-gripping robot in microgravity,"Yudai Yuguchi,Kenji Nagaoka,Kazuya Yoshida,","The surface of a minor body in space features a harsh terrain and microgravity. To explore such surfaces in detail, a robot with an appropriate moving mechanism is required. To this end, we proposed a robot that moves by gripping the surface like a rock climber. We focus on the robot's gait, where the motion of the idling arm generates the reaction force that acts on the gripper of the supporting arm. The reaction force needs to be controlled to maintain a grip without slipping. Therefore, we formulate a simultaneous control law that combines the tip position control of the idling arm with reactionless control by utilizing the reaction null-space. Moreover, the validity of the control law was confirmed by an experiment involving an air floating system under microgravity. Furthermore, a planar simulation clarified that the robot can move continuously on an irregular terrain."
icra,None,Measurement of stress distributions of a wheel with grousers traveling on loose soil,"Shoya Higa,Kazumasa Sawada,Kenji Nagaoka,Keiji Nagatani,Kazuya Yoshida,","A wheeled mobile robot traveling on loose soil has wheels with grousers (i.e., lugs) on their surface to improve its mobility performance. Although previous studies have analysis and modeling of the mobility performance of a wheel with grousers, most of them did not cover the stress distribution of the wheels. In this study, we measured the three-dimensional forces acting on the grouser and three locations of the wheel surface, respectively. The stress distributions generated beneath the wheel with grousers at every angle of the wheel rotation were represented based on the three-dimensional force data. The stress distributions showed that the shear stress hardly affects the wheel surface between each grouser."
icra,None,Task frame estimation during model-based teleoperation for satellite servicing,"Xiao Li,Peter Kazanzides,","Model-based teleoperation is suitable for systems with large communication delay because the operator interacts with a model of the task while the remote robot uses sensor-based control to replicate that interaction on the physical system. When the model geometry is accurately known, it is only necessary to register it to the remote physical system. If registration errors can be detected during the task, it is possible to update the local task frame (as in model mediated teleoperation) or the remote task frame. This paper proposes the latter approach for the case of telerobotic satellite servicing where the remote (on-orbit) robot cuts the tape that secures the patch of insulation covering the satellite access panel. This task can be modeled as sliding a tool along a planar surface (or one that is locally planar). The remote task frame is used by a hybrid position/force controller to maintain contact with the planar surface. Registration errors, however, can affect the orientation of the cutting tool and cause cutting failures. Therefore, the registration is updated during the task by using position measurements under the effect of hybrid control. The contributions of this paper are in the application of this method to teleoperation, where it must handle user-specified motions, and in the experimental verification during cutting, where compliance of the environment must be estimated and taken into account."
icra,None,Design of four-arm four-crawler disaster response robot OCTOPUS,"Mitsuhiro Kamezaki,Hiroyuki Ishii,Tatsuzo Ishida,Masatoshi Seki,,,,,,,,,","We developed a four-arm four-crawler advanced disaster response robot called OCTOPUS. Disaster response robots are expected to be capable of both mobility, e.g., entering narrow spaces over very rough unstable ground, and workability, e.g., conducting complex debris-demolition work. However, conventional disaster response robots are specialized in either mobility or workability. Moreover, strategies to independently enhance the capability of crawlers for mobility and arms for workability will increase the robot size and weight. To balance environmental applicability with the mobility and workability, OCTOPUS is equipped with a mutual complementary strategy between its arms and crawlers. The four arms conduct complex tasks while ensuring stabilization when climbing steps. The four crawlers translate rough terrain while avoiding toppling over when conducting demolition work. OCTOPUS is hydraulic driven and teleoperated by two operators. To evaluate the performance of OCTOPUS, we conducted preliminary experiments involving climbing high steps and removing attached objects by using the four arms. The results showed that OCTOPUS completed the two tasks by adequately coordinating its four arms and four crawlers and improvement in operability needs."
icra,None,Motion control of a compliant wheel-leg robot for rough terrain crossing,"Arthur Bouton,Christophe Grand,Faïz Benamar,","In this paper, we propose the use of compliant elements in the actuation of a wheel-legged robot in order to improve its locomotion properties on unknown and irregular terrains. Detection of the obstacles is achieved by a synergistic use of the structural compliances. The robot's capabilities to surmount steep obstacles is thus improved thanks to the inertia of the chassis and flexibility in postural control. In the proposed robot's kinematics, the four wheels are attached to the main body through vertical series elastic actuators (SEA) and with a passive horizontal compliant mechanism subject to a specific wheel speed control. The overall control relies on postural servoing and a local reactive loop which adapts the vertical forces applied by the SEA on each wheel according to the detected obstacle and the stability margin. The resulting system is evaluated with physical simulations for two case studies: a canonical steep obstacle on one wheel at a time and multiple random rough terrains."
icra,None,Autonomous repositioning and localization of an in situ fabricator,"Timothy Sandy,Markus Giftthaler,Kathrin Dörfler,Matthias Kohler,,","Despite the prevalent use of robotic technologies in industrial manufacturing, their use on building construction sites is still very limited. This is mainly due to the unstructured nature of construction sites and the fact that the structures built must be larger than the machines which build them. This paper addresses these difficulties by presenting a repositioning and localization system which, using purely on-board sensing, allows a mobile robot to maintain a high degree of end-effector positioning accuracy while moving among numerous building positions during a building task. We introduce a newly developed machine, called the In situ Fabricator (IF), whose goal is to bring digital fabrication to the construction site. The capabilities of the repositioning and localization system is demonstrated through the construction of a vertical stack of bricks, in which the IF repositions itself after placing each brick. With this experiment, we demonstrate that the IF can build with sub-centimeter accuracy over long building sequences."
icra,None,Low dimensional human preference tracking for motion optimization,"Stephen G. McGill,Seung-Joon Yi,Daniel D. Lee,","Motion planning for high degree of freedom (DOF) robots is not an easy task, and often requires optimization in a high dimensional space. Still, a generic motion planner using a single cost function for optimization may not be optimal over a number of different tasks with various task specific constraints. In this paper, we present a motion planning system that utilizes both easy to communicate human preferences and dimensionality reduction to handle these issues. Joint trajectories with human preference costs are projected into the null space of the task space, which helps make the resulting optimization simpler and more reliable. In addition, we apply the dimensionality reduction for the optimization, which significantly lowers the computational load. The suggested controller has been successfully used in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Finals to handle a number of manipulation tasks."
icra,None,Laban head-motions convey robot state: A call for robot body language,"Heather Knight,Reid Simmons,","Functional robots are an increasing presence in shared human-machine environments. Humans efficiently parse motion expressions, gaining an immediate impression of an agent's current action and state. Past work has shown that motion can effectively reveal a robot's current task objective to bystanders and collaborators, however, the layering of expression on pre-existing robot task motions has yet to be explored. Rather than showing us what the robot is doing, these layered motion characteristics leverage the how of the task motions to convey additional robot attitudes, e.g., confidence, adherence to deadline or flexibility of attention. To lay the foundations for this objective, we adapt the Laban Efforts, a system from dance and acting training in use for over 50 years. We operationalize features representing the four Laban Efforts (Time, Space, Weight, and Flow) to the movements of a 2-DOF Nao head and a 4-DOF Keepon robot during simple dance and look-for-someone behaviors. Using online survey, we collect 1028 motion ratings for 72 robot motion videos depicting contrasting Effort motion examples. We achieve statistically significant legibility results for all four Effort implementations. Even without human degrees of freedom, we find that robot motion patterns can convey complex expressions to people."
icra,None,Learning socially normative robot navigation behaviors with Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning,"Billy Okal,Kai O. Arras,","Mobile robots that navigate in populated environments require the capacity to move efficiently, safely and in human-friendly ways. In this paper, we address this task using a learning approach that enables a mobile robot to acquire navigation behaviors from demonstrations of socially normative human behavior. In the past, such approaches have been typically used to learn only simple behaviors under relatively controlled conditions using rigid representations or with methods that scale poorly to large domains. We thus develop a flexible graph-based representation able to capture relevant task structure and extend Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning to use sampled trajectories from this representation. In experiments with a real robot and a large-scale pedestrian simulator, we are able to show that the approach enables a robot to learn complex navigation behaviors of varying degrees of social normativeness using the same set of simple features."
icra,None,Autonomous indoor robot navigation using a sketch interface for drawing maps and routes,"Federico Boniardi,Abhinav Valada,Wolfram Burgard,Gian Diego Tipaldi,","Hand-Drawn sketches are natural means by which abstract descriptions of environments can be provided. They represent weak prior information about the scene, thereby enabling a robot to perform autonomous navigation and exploration when a full metrical description of the environment is not available beforehand. In this paper, we present an extensive evaluation of our navigation system that uses a sketch interface to allow the operator of a robot to draw a rough map of an indoor environment as well as a desired trajectory for the robot to follow. We employ a theoretical framework for sketch interpretation, in which associations between the sketch and the real world are modeled as local deformations of a suitable metric manifold. We investigate the effectiveness of our system and present empirical results from a set of experiments in real-world scenarios, focusing both on the navigation capabilities and the usability of the interface."

icra,None,Enhancing human-robot interaction by interpreting uncertain information in navigational commands based on experience and environment,"M. A. Viraj J. Muthugala,A. G. Buddhika P. Jayasekara,","Assistive robots can support activities of elderly people to uplift the living standard. The assistive robots should possess the ability to interact with the human peers in a human friendly manner because those systems are intended to be used by non-experts. Humans prefer to use voice instructions that include uncertain information and lexical symbols. Hence, the ability to understand uncertain information is mandatory for developing natural interaction capabilities in robots. This paper proposes a method to understand uncertain information such as “close”, “near” and “far” in navigational user commands based on the current environment and the experience of the robot. A robot experience model (REM) has been introduced to understand the lexical representations in user commands and to adapt the perception of the robot on uncertain information in heterogeneous domestic environments. The user commands are not bounded by a strict grammar model and this enables the users to operate the robot in a more natural way. The proposed method has been implemented on the assistive robot platform. The experiments have been carried out in an artificially created domestic environment and the results have been analyzed to identify the behaviors of the proposed concept."

Gao,Li-Shiuan Peh,","Laser distance sensors such as LIDAR are useful for many outdoor robotic vehicles, but their high cost and complexity precludes their use in low-cost applications, while other low-cost depth sensing technologies are not suitable for outdoor use. We present a low-cost, smartphone-based planar laser distance sensor design for outdoor use with 6 cm accuracy at 5 meters, 30 Hz scan rate, and 0.1 degree resolution over the field of view. The cost of the hardware additions to the off-the-shelf smartphone used in our prototype is under $50."
icra,None,Non-linear model-free control of flapping wing flying robot using iPID,"Aneesh N. Chand,Michihiro Kawanishi,Tatsuo Narikiyo,","Due to ill-defined and poorly understood dynamics of flapping wing flying robots, acquiring high-fidelity aero dynamical and control models for such aerial robots are challenging and often infeasible. In this work, we propose using a non-linear, model-free approach that eliminates errors arising from the mis-modeling or under-modeling of flapping dynamics. These procedures require no prior knowledge or model of any of the dynamical aspects of the flying robot and assume zero statistical knowledge about noise affecting sensor measurements. Intelligent PID (iPID) controllers are used to provide an abstracted treatment of all unknowns and uncertainties in the robot by encapsulating them together into a single term. The problem then devolves into the estimation of this term by either direct or indirect means which is more practical than obtaining high-fidelity models. For indirect estimation, numerical differentiation is required and we propose using a Haar-wavelet differentiator that is capable of smoothing and differentiating signals irrespective of the multivariate noise corrupting the signal. The direct estimation method uses an algebraic and non-asymptotic method. Pitch control and altitude control experiments are successfully performed on a real, bird-like flapping wing flying robot using all different approaches; results obtained reveal that indirect estimation using the Haar-wavelet differentiator provides slightly better performance."
icra,None,Application of an approximate model predictive control scheme on an unmanned aerial vehicle,"Matthias Hofer,Michael Muehlebach,Raffaello D'Andrea,",An approximate model predictive control approach is applied on an unmanned aerial vehicle with limited computational resources. A novel method using a continuous time parametrization of the state and input trajectory is used to derive a compact description of the optimal control problem. Different first order methods for the online optimization are discussed in terms of memory requirements and execution time. The generalized fast dual gradient method is implemented on the aerial vehicle. The approximate model predictive control algorithm runs on an embedded platform with a STM32 Cortex M4 processor. Simulation studies show that the model predictive controller outperforms a linear quadratic regulator in aggressive maneuvers. The model predictive control approach is evaluated in practice and shown to yield satisfactory flight behavior.
icra,None,Trajectory generation for quadrotor based systems using numerical optimal control,"Mathieu Geisert,Nicolas Mansard,","The recent work on quadrotor have focused on more and more challenging tasks with increasingly complex systems. Systems are often augmented with slung loads, inverted pendulums or arms, and accomplish complex tasks such as going through a window, grasping, throwing and catching. Usually, controllers are designed to accomplish a specific task on a specific system using analytic solutions, so each application needs long preparations. On the other hand, the direct multiple shooting approach is able to solve complex problems without any analytic development, by using off-the-shelf optimization solver. In this paper, we show that this approach is able to solve a wide range of problems relevant to quadrotor systems, from on-line trajectory generation for quadrotors to going through a window for a quadrotor-and-pendulum system, through manipulation tasks for a aerial manipulator."
icra,None,From tracking to robust maneuver regulation: An easy-to-design approach for VTOL aerial robots,"Sara Spedicato,Antonio Franchi,Giuseppe Notarstefano,","In this paper we present a maneuver regulation scheme for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) micro aerial vehicles (MAV). Differently from standard trajectory tracking, maneuver regulation has an intrinsic robustness due to the fact that the vehicle is not required to chase a virtual target, but just to stay on a (properly designed) desired path with a given velocity profile. In this paper we show how a robust maneuver regulation controller can be easily designed by converting an existing tracking scheme. The resulting maneuvering controller has three main appealing features, namely it: (i) inherits the robustness properties of the tracking controller, (ii) gains the appealing features of maneuver regulation, and (iii) does not need any additional tuning with respect to the tracking controller. We prove the correctness of the proposed scheme and show its effectiveness in experiments on a nano-quadrotor. In particular, we show on a nontrivial maneuver how external disturbances acting on the quadrotor cause instabilities in the standard tracking, while marginally affect the maneuver regulation scheme."
icra,None,Adaptive Super Twisting Controller for a quadrotor UAV,"Sujit Rajappa,Carlo Masone,Heinrich H. Bülthoff,Paolo Stegagno,","In this paper we present a robust quadrotor controller for tracking a reference trajectory in presence of uncertainties and disturbances. A Super Twisting controller is implemented using the recently proposed gain adaptation law [1], [2], which has the advantage of not requiring the knowledge of the upper bound of the lumped uncertainties. The controller design is based on the regular form of the quadrotor dynamics, without separation in two nested control loops for position and attitude. The controller is further extended by a feedforward dynamic inversion control that reduces the effort of the sliding mode controller. The higher order quadrotor dynamic model and proposed controller are validated using a SimMechanics physical simulation with initial error, parameter uncertainties, noisy measurements and external perturbations."
icra,None,Sensors model based data fusion using complementary filters for attitude estimation and stabilization,"A. El Hadri,L. Benziane,A. Seba,A. Benallegue,","This paper proposes simple and efficient algorithms for implementation of attitude estimation and control based on data fusion using complementary filters taking into account sensors dynamics. First of all, we propose a passive form of the filter by fusing the measured inertial vectors and the gyro measurements in order to reconstruct real inertial vectors which can be used with any algebraic algorithm (TRIAD, QUEST, etc.) that leads to globally asymptotic attitude estimation. Thereafter, the same principle of data fusion is used to address the problem of attitude stabilization. Then, instead of using direct raw measurements in control law we propose a new solution that leads to accurate estimation of inertial vectors by using complementary filters based on sensors dynamics. The stability analysis of the error dynamics based on Lyapunov method proved that almost all trajectories converge asymptotically to the desired equilibrium point. Simulation results show the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed solutions."
icra,None,"Obstacle detection, tracking and avoidance for a teleoperated UAV","Marcin Odelga,Paolo Stegagno,Heinrich H. Bülthoff,","In this paper, we present a collision-free indoor navigation algorithm for teleoperated multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Assuming an obstacle rich environment, the algorithm keeps track of detected obstacles in the local surroundings of the robot. The detection part of the algorithm is based on measurements from an RGB-D camera and a Bin-Occupancy filter capable of tracking an unspecified number of targets. We use the estimate of the robot's velocity to update the obstacles state when they leave the direct field of view of the sensor. The avoidance part of the algorithm is based on the Model Predictive Control approach. By predicting the possible future obstacles states, it filters the operator commands to prevent collisions. The method is validated on a platform equipped with its own computational unit, which makes it self-sufficient in terms of external CPUs."
icra,None,Prop-hanging control of a thrust vector vehicle with hybrid Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion method,"Yang Jiali,Zhu Jihong,","The prop-hanging control of the fixed-wing aircraft can enable the vehicle to improve the cruise performance and hover ability. The prop-hanging control of the thrust vector vehicle would be a challenging problem, for the reason that it is a system with properties of inherent instability, coupling, non-linearity and non-minimum phase characteristics. To deal with these complex problems, a hybrid Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) method is proposed in this paper. Inspired by NDI, Incremental NDI and angular acceleration feedback control methods, the hybrid NDI method includes three parts: feedforward control, proportional control and logical integral control, which can enable the system to have a rapid response in the transient phase and a satisfactory performance in the steady state. A numerical simulation is conducted to test the performance and the robustness of the proposed control method, and a Hardware-in-the-loop simulation is also conducted to check the practicability and effectiveness in the actual application. Simulation results show that the proposed control method can effectively improve system robustness and is practical."

Wind tunnel measurements are used to get an understanding of the control allocation and to model the static forces and moments acting on the system. Based on the derived model, a novel controller that operates in SO(3) and handles the dynamics of the vehicle at any attitude configuration, including the rotorcraft and fixed-wing regimes as well as their transitions, is presented. This unified controller allows the autonomous transition of the system without discontinuities of switching, as well as its overall high performance flight control. The capabilities and flying qualities of the platform and the controller are demonstrated and evaluated by means of extensive experimental studies."
icra,None,On-line coaching of robots through visual and physical interaction: Analysis of effectiveness of human-robot interaction strategies,"Andrej Gams,Aleš Ude,","Continuous and on-line adaptation of robotic trajectories is one of the key properties of robotic control policies that make robots useful in unstructured environments, where the conditions of the external world are not predefined or stationary. Modification of robotic trajectories through human intervention, in order to make them more suitable to the user, is often termed as robotic coaching. In the manner of a tutor, the user shows to the robot which part of the motion to change and how. Predefined gestures acquired with visual systems and direct physical interaction are two possibilities to realize robotic coaching. In this paper we study what are the desired user features and which of the three tested coaching methods is deemed most favorable by a group of 7 subjects. The three methods we explore all build on on-line coaching of dynamic motion primitives, but are based on different feedback signals, i. e., visual or force feedback, and different low-level robot control approaches, i. e., a stiff or a compliant robot. The experiment required coaching of a KUKA LWR-4 robot arm while wiping a flat surface, so that it followed two simple patterns. The survey presented in this paper aims at providing the designers of human-robot coaching interfaces with answers on the feasibility, advantages and drawbacks of the three methods for on-line coaching analyzed in this paper: 1. visual feedback, 2. force feedback with a stiff robot, and 3. position feedback with a compliant robot."
icra,None,An ISO10218-compliant adaptive damping controller for safe physical human-robot interaction,"Benjamin Navarro,Andrea Cherubini,Aïcha Fonte,Robin Passama,,,","In human-robot interaction, the robot must behave safely, especially when an operator is present in its workspace. Even higher safety levels must be attained when physical contact occurs between the two. To this end, standards such as the ISO10218 define the requirements for a robot to be considered safe for interaction with human operators in an industrial environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive damping controller that fulfills the ISO10218 requirements by limiting the tool velocity, power and contact force online (and only when needed). The controller is experimentally validated on a hand-arm robotic system, in a mock-up collaborative application. For the hand, safe interaction is enhanced by using tactile sensing, both to regulate grasp forces and to provide an intuitive interface for the operator."
icra,None,Manipulator performance constraints in Cartesian admittance control for human-robot cooperation,"Fotios Dimeas,Vassilis C. Moulianitis,Charalampos Papakonstantinou,,","This paper addresses the problem of providing feedback to the operator about the manipulator's performance during human-robot physical interaction. A method is proposed that implements virtual constraints in Cartesian admittance control in order to prevent the operator from guiding the manipulator to low-performance configurations. The constraints are forces expressed in the Cartesian frame, which restrict the translation of the end-effector when the operator guides the robot below a certain performance threshold. These forces are calculated online by numerically approximating the gradient of the performance index with respect to the Cartesian frame attached to the end-effector. An experimental evaluation is conducted involving human-robot interaction with a 7-DOF LWR serial manipulator under Cartesian admittance control, using the kinematic manipulability index of the manipulator as the performance measure for singularity avoidance."
icra,None,Impedance-based Gaussian Processes for predicting human behavior during physical interaction,"José Ramón Medina,Satoshi Endo,Sandra Hirche,","For seamless physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), estimating human intention is essential. Most system identification approaches to pHRI model the human as a black box without prior assumptions about the underlying behavioral structure. However, integrating a priori knowledge about behavioral characteristics of the human provides superior prediction performance. In this work we present a novel method for human behavior prediction during physical interaction that incorporates an empirically supported human motor control model. The arm dynamics of the human are modeled as a mechanical impedance that follows a latent desired trajectory. We adopt a Bayesian perspective setting Gaussian Process (GP) priors on impedance parameters and the desired trajectory, which allows regression about human behavior from observed trajectories and interaction forces. The proposed impedance-based GP model is validated in simulation and in an experiment with human participants to demonstrate its prediction performance and generalization capability."

User can move by pedaling and easily realize free locomotion although they have handicaps. When they use the cycling wheelchair in outdoors, it is necessary to solve the problem of upward slope and downward slope. In this study, we develop a new cycling wheelchair as the system realizing enough aid without motor assist in the way of the safety. We attach CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) and servo brake on this cycling wheelchair and propose their control methods. By controlling CVT, we can maintain the state of pedaling easily, climb up the slope easily and increase the speed. Also, we realize gravity compensation by controlling servo brake, we can pedal at down slope like a horizontal road. We performed experiment and illustrate the validity of the proposed method."

In this paper, we present two essential considerations for design and control of robots physically interacting with humans: energetic passivity and mechanical impedance. Characterization of passive, dissipative, and active behavior of the human neuromuscular system is essential to ensure and control coupled stability in physical human-robot interaction. In addition, characterization of human mechanical impedance at the interaction port provides detailed quantitative information to describe interactive dynamics. The importance of these characterizations is demonstrated by simple examples and the authors' previous research on the human ankle. Implications for quantitative guidelines for robot design and control are discussed."

We develop an energy monitoring control system that observes energy flows among the different subsystems involved in pHRC, shaping them to improve human safety according to selected metrics. Port-Hamiltonian formalisms are used to model each sub-system and their interconnection. An energy-based compliance controller that enhances safety by adapting the robot behavior is proposed and validated through extensive simulations."
icra,None,Design and development of a hybrid Magneto-Rheological clutch for safe robotic applications,"Masoud Moghani,Mehrdad R. Kermani,","In this paper, we present a new concept for generating magnetic field in Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches intended for safe robotic applications. The main rationale behind this concept is to divide the magnetic field generation into two parts using an electromagnetic coil and a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet generates a bias magnetic field density at the optimum working point of the MR clutch while the energized coil can add or negate the magnetic field to a desired value. The results will show clear advantages of this concept in reducing the total weight of the MR clutch, improving the torque-to-mass ratio, and reducing electrical power consumption. The proposed concept is validated using computer model of an MR clutch and Finite Element Method (FEM) is hired to compare the characteristics of the proposed MR clutch with those from conventional coil based clutch. Experimental results will be provided to further validate the advantages of the proposed new concept."
icra,None,Angled sensor configuration capable of measuring tri-axial forces for pHRI,"Christian Reeks,Marc G. Carmichael,Dikai Liu,Kenneth J. Waldron,","This paper presents a new configuration for single axis tactile sensor arrays molded in rubber to enable tri-axial force measurement. The configuration requires the sensing axis of each sensor in the array to be rotated out of alignment with respect to external forces. This angled sensor array measures shear forces along axes in a way that is different to a planar sensor array. Three sensors using the angled configuration (22.5°, 45° and 67.5°) and a fourth sensor using the planar configuration (0°) have been fabricated for experimental comparison. Artificial neural networks were trained to interpret the external force applied along each axis (X, Y and Z) from raw pressure sensor values. The results show that the angled sensor configuration is capable of measuring tri-axial external forces with a root mean squared error of 1.79N, less error in comparison to the equivalent sensor utilizing the planar configuration (4.52N). The sensors are then implemented to control a robotic arm. Preliminary findings show angled sensor arrays to be a viable alternative to planar sensor arrays for shear force measurement; this has wide applications in physical Human Robot Interaction (pHRI)."

It is important to ensure that humans and robots do not harm each other. This paper is concerned with functional issues to ensure safe and efficient interactions among human workers and the next generation intelligent industrial co-robots. The robot motion planning and control problem in a human involved environment is posed as a constrained optimal control problem. A modularized parallel controller structure is proposed to solve the problem online, which includes a baseline controller that ensures efficiency, and a safety controller that addresses real time safety by making a safe set invariant. Capsules are used to represent the complicated geometry of humans and robots. The design considerations of each module are discussed. Simulation studies which reproduce realistic scenarios are performed on a planar robot arm and a 6 DoF robot arm. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the method."
icra,None,Multi-constrained joint transportation tasks by teams of autonomous mobile robots using a dynamical systems approach,"Toni Machado,Tiago Malheiro,Sérgio Monteiro,Wolfram Erlhagen,,","We present a distributed leader-helper architecture for teams of two autonomous mobile robots that jointly transport large payloads while avoiding collisions with obstacles (either static or dynamic). The leader navigates to the goal destination and the helper is responsible for maintaining an appropriate distance (which is a function of the object's length) to the leader. Both robots share the responsibility of ensuring that the transported object does not collide with obstructions. No path needs to be given a priori to the robots nor to the payload. The team is able to perform its transportation task in unknown environments that can have corridors, corners and may change the layout online. The payload can be of different dimensions. The team is able to cope with abrupt/strong perturbations that challenge the team behavior during the execution of the task. These characteristics make this approach suitable to be deployed in warehouses or office-like environments. The motion of each robot is controlled by a time series asymptotically stable states, which is formalized using the attractor dynamics approach to behavior based robotics. The advantages are: (i) the overt behavior is smooth and stable; (ii) because the behavior is generated as a time sequence of attractor states, for the control variables, it contributes to the overall asymptotically stability of the system that makes it robust against perturbations. We present results of experiments in simulated environments and with real robots in real environments."
icra,None,Recurrent Neural Networks for driver activity anticipation via sensory-fusion architecture,"Ashesh Jain,Avi Singh,Hema S Koppula,Shane Soh,Ashutosh Saxena,","Anticipating the future actions of a human is a widely studied problem in robotics that requires spatio-temporal reasoning. In this work we propose a deep learning approach for anticipation in sensory-rich robotics applications. We introduce a sensory-fusion architecture which jointly learns to anticipate and fuse information from multiple sensory streams. Our architecture consists of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to capture long temporal dependencies. We train our architecture in a sequence-to-sequence prediction manner, and it explicitly learns to predict the future given only a partial temporal context. We further introduce a novel loss layer for anticipation which prevents over-fitting and encourages early anticipation. We use our architecture to anticipate driving maneuvers several seconds before they happen on a natural driving data set of 1180 miles. The context for maneuver anticipation comes from multiple sensors installed on the vehicle. Our approach shows significant improvement over the state-of-the-art in maneuver anticipation by increasing the precision from 77.4% to 90.5% and recall from 71.2% to 87.4%."
icra,None,Unsupervised trajectory compression,"Padraig Corcoran,Peter Mooney,Guoquan Huang,","We present a method for compressing trajectories in an unsupervised manner. Given a set of trajectories sampled from a space we construct a basis for compression whose elements correspond to paths in the space which are topologically distinct. This is achieved by computing a canonical representative for each element in a generating set for the first homology group and decomposing these representatives into a set of distinct paths. Trajectory compression is subsequently accomplished through representation in terms of this basis. Robustness with respect to outliers is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist in the super-level sets of the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) above a threshold. Robustness with respect to small scale topological artifacts is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist for a sufficient range in the super-level sets. We demonstrate this approach to trajectory compression in the context of a large set of crowd-sourced GPS trajectories captured in the city of Chicago. On this set, the compression method achieves a mean geometrical accuracy of 108 meters with a compression ratio of over 12."
icra,None,Improving dependability of industrial transport robots using model-based techniques,"Clemens Mühlbacher,Stephan Gspandl,Michael Reip,Gerald Steinbauer,","When autonomous robots are deployed in an industrial setting they are expected to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Therefore, dependability of the robots is crucial. In this paper we present an approach following the model-driven engineering idea that supports dependability in different stages of the live cycle of robots. In particular we present how model-based testing and diagnosis can be used for this goal and how suitable models for these approaches can be obtained. The proposed approach was evaluated in a real industrial use-case showing superior performance compared to the hand-coded solutions used before."
icra,None,Dynamic routing of energy-aware vehicles with Temporal Logic Constraints,"Derya Aksaray,Cristian-Ioan Vasile,Calin Belta,","This paper addresses a persistent vehicle routing problem, where a team of vehicles is required to achieve a task repetitively. The task is given as a Time-Window Temporal Logic (TWTL) formula defined over the environment. The fuel consumption of each vehicle is explicitly captured as a stochastic model. As vehicles leave the mission area for refueling, the number of vehicles may not always be sufficient to achieve the task. We propose a decoupled and efficient control policy to achieve the task or its minimal relaxation. We quantify the temporal relaxation of a TWTL formula and present an algorithm to minimize it. The proposed policy has two layers: 1) each vehicle decides when to refuel based on its remaining fuel, 2) a central authority plans the joint trajectories of the available vehicles to achieve a minimally relaxed task. We demonstrate the proposed approach via simulations and experiments involving a team of quadrotors that conduct persistent surveillance."
icra,None,A new multi-agent approach for lane detection and tracking,"M. Revilloud,D. Gruyer,MC. Rahal,","This paper proposes an unconventional approach for multi-lane detection and tracking based on a reactive multi-agent system. Most of the algorithms use camera information with a two-step process to detect road marking (1) extraction of road marking features, (2) lane estimation and tracking, performed by studying the extracted point distribution. However, our proposed method is based on a confidence map instead of lane marking features, and a multi-agent model instead of geometric fitting. This approach takes better account of the specific features of road markings, and more precisely, parts defined by clothoids. The method has been tested on a real-world dataset of images in real condition and evaluated with a sequence of more than 2500 synthetic images provided by the SiVIC platform. First results are very promising, with more than 98% for ego lane detection and 97% for multi-lane detection with 4% of false alarm. Furthermore, this approach gives us new opportunities to improve lane detection which would be difficult to implement in a more conventional approach."
icra,None,Optimal navigation policy for an autonomous agent operating in adversarial environments,"Emmanuel Boidot,Aude Marzuoli,Eric Feron,","We consider an autonomous vehicle navigation problem, whereby a traveler aims at traversing an environment in which an adversary tries to set an ambush. Optimal strategies are computed as random path distributions, a realization of which is the path chosen by the traveler. Theoretical optimal policies are derived under assumptions from the Minimal Cut-Maximal Flow literature. Numerical approaches to compute such optimal strategies are proposed. These numerical approaches, which borrow from randomized path planning techniques, can be implemented for high-dimensional configuration spaces. The methodology developed allows for the application of ambush games on complex environments for realistic applications regarding vehicle routing in adversarial settings."
icra,None,Observability analysis and optimal sensor placement in stereo radar odometry,"Andreu Corominas-Murtra,Joan Vallvé,Joan Solà,Ismael Flores,,","Localization is the key perceptual process closing the loop of autonomous navigation, allowing self-driving vehicles to operate in a deliberate way. To ensure robust localization, autonomous vehicles have to implement redundant estimation processes, ideally independent in terms of the underlying physics behind sensing principles. This paper presents a stereo radar odometry system, which can be used as such a redundant system, complementary to other odometry estimation processes, providing robustness for long-term operability. The presented work is novel with respect to previously published methods in that it contains: (i) a detailed formulation of the Doppler error and its associated uncertainty; (ii) an observability analysis that gives the minimal conditions to infer a 2D twist from radar readings; and (iii) a numerical analysis for optimal vehicle sensor placement. Experimental results are also detailed that validate the theoretical insights."
icra,None,"Traffic awareness driver assistance based on stereovision, eye-tracking, and head-up display","Tobias Langner,Daniel Seifert,Bennet Fischer,Daniel Goehring,,,","This paper presents a system which constantly monitors the level of attention of a driver in traffic. The vehicle is instrumented and can identify the state of traffic-lights, as well as obstacles on the road. If the driver is inattentive and fails to recognize a threat, the assistance system produces a warning. Therefore, the system helps the driver to focus on crucial traffic situations. Our system consists of three components: computer vision detection of traffic-lights and other traffic participants, an eye tracking device used also for head localization, and finally, a human machine interface consisting of a head-up display and an acoustic module used to provide warnings to the driver. The orientation of the driver's head is detected using fiducial markers visible in video frames. We describe how the system was integrated using an autonomous car as experimental ADAS platform."
icra,None,Exploiting fully convolutional neural networks for fast road detection,"Caio César Teodoro Mendes,Vincent Frémont,Denis Fernando Wolf,","Road detection is a crucial task in autonomous navigation systems. It is responsible for delimiting the road area and hence the free and valid space for maneuvers. In this paper, we consider the visual road detection problem where, given an image, the objective is to classify every of its pixels into road or non-road. We address this task by proposing a convolutional neural network architecture. We are especially interested in a model that takes advantage of a large contextual window while maintaining a fast inference. We achieve this by using a Network-in-Network (NiN) architecture and by converting the model into a fully convolutional network after training. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effects of different contextual window sizes (the amount of contextual information) and also to evaluate the NiN aspect of the proposed architecture. Finally, we evaluated our approach using the KITTI road detection benchmark achieving results in line with other state-of-the-art methods while maintaining real-time inference. The benchmark results also reveal that the inference time of our approach is unique at this level of accuracy, being two orders of magnitude faster than other methods with similar performance."
icra,None,Multi-scale object candidates for generic object tracking in street scenes,"Aljoša Ošep,Alexander Hermans,Francis Engelmann,Dirk Klostermann,,,","Most vision based systems for object tracking in urban environments focus on a limited number of important object categories such as cars or pedestrians, for which powerful detectors are available. However, practical driving scenarios contain many additional objects of interest, for which suitable detectors either do not yet exist or would be cumbersome to obtain. In this paper we propose a more general tracking approach which does not follow the often used tracking-by-detection principle. Instead, we investigate how far we can get by tracking unknown, generic objects in challenging street scenes. As such, we do not restrict ourselves to only tracking the most common categories, but are able to handle a large variety of static and moving objects. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI dataset and show competitive results for the annotated classes, even though we are not restricted to them."
icra,None,High-performance and tunable stereo reconstruction,"Sudeep Pillai,Srikumar Ramalingam,John J. Leonard,","Traditional stereo algorithms have focused their efforts on reconstruction quality and have largely avoided prioritizing for run time performance. Robots, on the other hand, require quick maneuverability and effective computation to observe its immediate environment and perform tasks within it. In this work, we propose a high-performance and tunable stereo disparity estimation method, with a peak frame-rate of 120Hz (VGA resolution, on a single CPU-thread), that can potentially enable robots to quickly reconstruct their immediate surroundings and maneuver at high-speeds. Our key contribution is a disparity estimation algorithm that iteratively approximates the scene depth via a piece-wise planar mesh from stereo imagery, with a fast depth validation step for semi-dense reconstruction. The mesh is initially seeded with sparsely matched keypoints, and is recursively tessellated and refined as needed (via a resampling stage), to provide the desired stereo disparity accuracy. The inherent simplicity and speed of our approach, with the ability to tune it to a desired reconstruction quality and runtime performance makes it a compelling solution for applications in high-speed vehicles."
icra,None,Generation and real-time implementation of high-speed controlled maneuvers using an autonomous 19-gram quadrotor,"Ying Chen,Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia,","We present a new experimental method for the generation and real-time implementation of high-speed aerobatic maneuvers, including multiple flips, on a 19-gram autonomous quadrotor. A key element in the proposed approach is the design and experimental tuning of a gain scheduling control strategy in which two linear time-invariant (LTI) controllers are alternatingly activated and deactivated to switch between a normal flight mode and an aerobatic mode, enabling the flyer to perform consecutive multiple flips in a robustly stable manner. The implementation of the controllers is done using on-board power, sensors and computing capabilities, so that the quadrotor remains fully autonomous during flight. Notably, the attainment of autonomy, using real-time control, is made possible by the development of a new method for speed planning based on cubic functions, the geometric generalization of the notion of multi-flip and the empirical identification of the flyer's dynamics, required for trajectory generation and controller synthesis. Compelling experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach. In particular, we present maneuvers that include consecutive single, double, and triple flips about the flyer's roll principal axis and a non-principal axis. To the best of our knowledge, to this date, the flyer used in this research is the smallest controlled quadrotor to have autonomously accomplished three consecutive flips while remaining stable."
icra,None,A novel hyperacute gimbal eye to implement precise hovering and target tracking on a quadrotor,"Augustin Manecy,Julien Diperi,Marc Boyron,Nicolas Marchand,,","This paper presents a new minimalist bio-inspired artificial eye of only 24 pixels, able to locate accurately a target placed in its small field of view (±10°). The eye is mounted on a very light custom-made gimbal system which makes the eye able to track faithfully a moving target. We have shown, that our gimbal eye can be embedded on a small quadrotor to achieve accurate hovering with respect to a target placed onto the ground. Our aiborne eye was enhanced with a bio-inspired reflex in charge of locking efficiently the robot's gaze onto a target and compensate for the robot's rotations and disturbances. The use of very few pixels allowed to implement a visual processing algorithm at a refresh rate of 400 Hz. This high refresh rate coupled to a very fast control of the eye's orientation allowed the robot to track a target moving at a speed up to 200° · s-1."

Developing a biologically inspired bat robot would yield insight into how bats control their body attitude and position through the complex interaction of nonlinear forces (e.g., aerodynamic) and their intricate musculoskeletal mechanism. The current work introduces a biologically inspired soft robot called Bat Bot (B2). The overall system is a flapping machine with 5 Degrees of Actuation (DoA). This work reports on some of the preliminary untethered flights of B2. B2 has a nontrivial morphology and it has been designed after examining several biological bats. Key DoAs, which contribute significantly to bat flight, are picked and incorporated in B2's flight mechanism design. These DoAs are: 1) forelimb flapping motion, 2) forelimb mediolateral motion (folding and unfolding) and 3) hindlimb dorsoventral motion (upward and downward movement)."
icra,None,Development of a 3.2g untethered flapping-wing platform for flight energetics and control experiments,"Michelle H. Rosen,Geoffroy le Pivain,Ranjana Sahai,Noah T. Jafferis,,","This paper presents a biologically inspired, 3.2g untethered vehicle capable of both active (flapping) and passive (gliding) flight. We discuss the overall vehicle design, as well as its validation with thrust data from benchtop testing, simulation, and flight test results. The vehicle has one pair of flapping wings for thrust generation, making it a good analogue for insects of the same scale. Flight energetics and control can be thoroughly explored through the array of simulation and testing that have been implemented. Integrated electronics provide wireless communication, sensing, and basic open-loop flight control, making flight test iteration fast and providing additional dynamics data. All of the testing setups and the physical vehicle working together have created a robust development environment for future iterations on the vehicle. The successful flight of the vehicle, including the data collection from onboard sensors and an external motion capture arena, show that this platform is ideal to study flight energetics and control schemes at an insect scale."
icra,None,Non-linear resonance modeling and system design improvements for underactuated flapping-wing vehicles,"Noah T. Jafferis,Moritz A. Graule,Robert J. Wood,","Insect-scale flying robots are currently unable to carry the power source and sensor suite required for autonomous operation. To overcome this challenge, we developed and experimentally verified a non-linear damping model of actuation-limited flapping-wing vehicles with passively rotating wing hinges. In agreement with studies on the wing dynamics of honey bees, we found that the optimal angle of the passive wing hinge in mid-stroke is about 70 ° rather than 45-50 ° as previously assumed. We further identified a narrow actuation force window in which the occurrence of a sharp resonance can be used to achieve both higher lift and efficiency. The findings from our model informed design changes to the Harvard Dual-Actuator Robobee, which resulted in a 130% increase in mean lift from ~140mg to 320mg (with a vehicle mass increase of only 5 - 8%), along with a corresponding expected payload increase of 330 - 470% (30 - 40mg to 170mg). The power consumption only increased by ~55%, making the new prototype 50% more efficient at lift production. Our model provides a greater understanding of the dynamics of this complex system, and the resulting lift and efficiency improvements are expected to bring insect-scale flying robots closer to autonomy."
icra,None,Thrust loss saving design of overlapping rotor arrangement on small multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles,"Hikaru Otsuka,Keiji Nagatani,","Small multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are suitable for surveillance or inspection operations, such as disaster site observations or building inspections, as they can hover. Therefore, engineers and associations plan to use them for civilian applications. However, the payload capacity of current UAVs is too small to carry heavy sensors or batteries. Thus, improving payload capacity by increasing the number of rotors has been considered to achieve an increase in the thrust for a limited body size. Although, most rotor arrangements cause rotor flow interaction, which degrade the total thrust. To design a rotor arrangement on small multirotor UAVs, it is necessary to first evaluate the thrust from an aerodynamic perspective. In this study, we evaluated the effect of rotor flow interactions on thrust for three two-rotor configurations. The investigation showed that the thrust of rotors in wake flow is degraded. Thus, we proposed a new octorotor UAV configuration based on the results of our evaluation of the rotor flow interaction and verified the thrust improvement compared to a coaxial octorotor UAV configuration. This investigation demonstrated a thrust improvement of 24% over the total thrust of the coaxial octorotor UAV."
icra,None,Versatile aerial grasping using self-sealing suction,"Chad C. Kessens,Justin Thomas,Jaydev P. Desai,Vijay Kumar,","This paper addresses the challenge of versatile aerial grasping utilizing suction while considering the limitations of an on-board vacuum pump. It builds upon our patented self-sealing suction cup technology, which allows the exertion of local pulling contact forces for grasping a wide range of objects. The novel self-sealing nature of the cups enables the gripper to be versatile, employing just one, several, or all of the cups for the grasp in a passively actuated manner. We begin by describing the design of the system and its components. Because aerial applications are typically sensitive to weight constraints, we used a micro-pump vacuum generator, which introduced new challenges for our system. To investigate and overcome those challenges, we tested the relationship between the cup's design and its leakage, activation force, and maximum holding force. In addition, we tested the performance of the individual gripper components, the aerial vehicle's ability to transfer force to the cups, the system's ability to grip inclined surfaces, and finally the vehicle's ability to grasp a multitude of objects using various numbers of cups. This included the grasping of one object, followed by the grasping of a second object while still holding the first object."
icra,None,Local histogram matching for efficient optical flow computation applied to velocity estimation on pocket drones,"Kimberly McGuire,Guido de Croon,Christophe de Wagter,Bart Remes,,,","Autonomous flight of pocket drones is challenging due to the severe limitations on on-board energy, sensing, and processing power. However, tiny drones have great potential as their small size allows maneuvering through narrow spaces while their small weight provides significant safety advantages. This paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for determining optical flow, which can be run on an STM32F4 microprocessor (168 MHz) of a 4 gram stereo-camera. The optical flow algorithm is based on edge histograms. We propose a matching scheme to determine local optical flow. Moreover, the method allows for sub-pixel flow determination based on time horizon adaptation. We demonstrate velocity measurements in flight and use it within a velocity control-loop on a pocket drone."

Based on a static force and torque analysis for generic actuator configurations, we derive an eight-rotor configuration that maximizes the vehicle's agility in any direction. The proposed vehicle design possesses full force and torque authority in all three dimensions. A control strategy that allows for exploiting the vehicle's decoupled translational and rotational dynamics is introduced. A prototype of the proposed vehicle design is built using reversible motor-propeller actuators and capable of flying at any orientation. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the novel design and the capabilities of the vehicle."
icra,None,Dynamic underactuated flying-walking (DUCK) robot,"Christopher J. Pratt,Kam K. Leang,","This paper describes the development of a flying and walking robot, called the dynamic underactuated flying-walking (DUCK) robot. The DUCK robot combines a high-mobility flying platform, such as a quadcopter (quadrotor helicopter), with passive-dynamic legs to create a versatile system that can fly and walk. One of the advantages of passive-dynamic legs for walking is that additional actuators are not needed for terrestrial locomotion. Herein, a mathematical model is presented and simulations are used to help design a prototype robot. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of combining an aerial platform with passive-dynamic legs to create an effective flying and walking robot. In particular, two modes of walking are demonstrated: (1) passive walking down inclined surfaces for low-energy terrestrial locomotion, and (2) active (powered) walking by leveraging the capabilities of the flying platform, where thrust from the quadcopter's rotors enables the DUCK robot to take steps and walk on flat surfaces or up inclined surfaces."
icra,None,A controllable flying vehicle with a single moving part,"Weixuan Zhang,Mark W. Mueller,Raffaello D'Andrea,","This paper presents the “monospinner”: a mechanically simple flying vehicle with only one moving part. The vehicle is shown to be controllable in three translational degrees of freedom and two rotational degrees of freedom. The vehicle has a single scalar control input, the thrust magnitude, and is controlled by a cascaded control strategy with an inner attitude controller and an outer position controller. The vehicle design is chosen based on two robustness metrics: the ability to maintain hover under perturbations and the probability of input saturation based on a stochastic model. The resulting mechanical and control designs are experimentally demonstrated, where it is also shown that the vehicle is sufficiently robust to achieve hover after being thrown into the air."
icra,None,Anomalous yaw torque generation from passively pitching wings,"Nick Gravish,Robert J. Wood,","Small, lightweight micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) must rely on a limited number of actuators for flight stability and control. A method for six-degree of freedom control in a dual-actuator MAV has been previously proposed which employs stroke amplitude, bias, and split-cycle timing modulation. This control scheme is the basis of actuation for stable, controlled flapping wing flight of the Harvard Robobee. The role of passive wing pitching dynamics are currently unexplored in their effects on yaw-dynamics during free flight. Here we demonstrate in simulation and experiment the critical role wing pitching dynamics play in yaw control of a dual-actuated MAV using the split-cycle control scheme. We find that yaw-authority sensitively depends on the functional form of the wing hinge joint and that pitching dynamics of wing hinges with linear stiffness may compromise yaw control. To solve this we present a design method for laminate based non-linear hinges and demonstrate that non-linear hinge stiffness improves yaw torque generation during split-cycle actuation."
icra,None,SUAV:Q - a hybrid approach to solar-powered flight,"Ruben D'Sa,Devon Jenson,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","Selecting an aerial platform for an application typically requires compromise. A choice must be made between the flight time and long-range capabilities of a fixed-wing aircraft or the maneuverability and stationary characteristics of a multi-rotor platform. Recent developments of small-scale solar-powered UAVs have leveraged the advances in solar cell, energy storage, and propulsion system technology to reach extended flight times capable of all-day and multi-day flight. This paper presents the concept of a small-scale hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle capable of augmenting the maneuverability of a quad-rotor with the energy collection and supply of a solar-powered fixed-wing aircraft. An investigation into the aircraft design, transforming mechanism, and energy management of the multi-state system is presented. A proof-of-concept prototype has been constructed to demonstrate the airframe operating in a quad-rotor configuration. Power electronics capable of simultaneous battery charging and power loading from a solar array have been validated. Additional work in optimization of the propulsion system and airframe needs to be completed to maximize the performance of the hybrid system."
icra,None,3D gaze cursor: Continuous calibration and end-point grasp control of robotic actuators,"Pablo M. Tostado,William W. Abbott,A. Aldo Faisal,","Eye movements are closely related to motor actions, and hence can be used to infer motor intentions. Additionally, eye movements are in some cases the only means of communication and interaction with the environment for paralysed and impaired patients with severe motor deficiencies. Despite this, eye-tracking technology still has a very limited use as a human-robot control interface and its applicability is highly restricted to 2D simple tasks that operate on screen based interfaces and do not suffice for natural physical interaction with the environment. We propose that decoding the gaze position in 3D space rather than in 2D results into a much richer “spatial cursor” signal that allows users to perform everyday tasks such as grasping and moving objects via gaze-based robotic teleoperation. Eye tracking in 3D calibration is usually slow - we demonstrate here that by using a full 3D trajectory for system calibration generated by a robotic arm rather than a simple grid of discrete points, gaze calibration in the 3 dimensions can be successfully achieved in short time and with high accuracy. We perform the non-linear regression from eye-image to 3D-end point using Gaussian Process regressors, which allows us to handle uncertainty in end-point estimates gracefully. Our telerobotic system uses a multi-joint robot arm with a gripper and is integrated with our in-house “GT3D” binocular eye tracker. This prototype system has been evaluated and assessed in a test environment with 7 users, yielding gaze-estimation errors of less than 1cm in the horizontal, vertical and depth dimensions, and less than 2cm in the overall 3D Euclidean space. Users reported intuitive, low-cognitive load, control of the system right from their first trial and were straightaway able to simply look at an object and command through a wink to “grasp this” object with the robot gripper."
icra,None,SRAC: Self-Reflective Risk-Aware Artificial Cognitive models for robot response to human activities,"Hao Zhang,Christopher Reardon,Fei Han,Lynne E. Parker,","In human-robot teaming, interpretation of human actions, recognition of new situations, and appropriate decision making are crucial abilities for cooperative robots (“co-robots”) to interact intelligently with humans. Given an observation, it is important that human activities are interpreted the same way by co-robots as human peers so that robot actions can be appropriate to the activity at hand. A novel interpretability indicator is introduced to address this issue. When a robot encounters a new scenario, the pretrained activity recognition model, no matter how accurate in a known situation, may not produce the correct information necessary to act appropriately and safely in new situations. To effectively and safely interact with people, we introduce a new generalizability indicator that allows a co-robot to self-reflect and reason about when an observation falls outside the co-robot's learned model. Based on topic modeling and the two novel indicators, we propose a new Self-reflective Risk-aware Artificial Cognitive (SRAC) model, which allows a robot to make better decisions by incorporating robot action risks and identifying new situations. Experiments both using real-world datasets and on physical robots suggest that our SRAC model significantly outperforms the traditional methodology and enables better decision making in response to human behaviors."
icra,None,Markerless perspective taking for humanoid robots in unconstrained environments,"Tobias Fischer,Yiannis Demiris,","Perspective taking enables humans to imagine the world from another viewpoint. This allows reasoning about the state of other agents, which in turn is used to more accurately predict their behavior. In this paper, we equip an iCub humanoid robot with the ability to perform visuospatial perspective taking (PT) using a single depth camera mounted above the robot. Our approach has the distinct benefit that the robot can be used in unconstrained environments, as opposed to previous works which employ marker-based motion capture systems. Prior to and during the PT, the iCub learns the environment, recognizes objects within the environment, and estimates the gaze of surrounding humans. We propose a new head pose estimation algorithm which shows a performance boost by normalizing the depth data to be aligned with the human head. Inspired by psychological studies, we employ two separate mechanisms for the two different types of PT. We implement line of sight tracing to determine whether an object is visible to the humans (level 1 PT). For more complex PT tasks (level 2 PT), the acquired point cloud is mentally rotated, which allows algorithms to reason as if the input data was acquired from an egocentric perspective. We show that this can be used to better judge where object are in relation to the humans. The multifaceted improvements to the PT pipeline advance the state of the art, and move PT in robots to markerless, unconstrained environments."
icra,None,Novel planning-based algorithms for human motion prediction,"Dizan Vasquez,","Human motion prediction from visual tracking is a challenging problem with a wide array of applications such as robotics, video surveillance and situation understanding. Recently, planning-based methods -which assume that people move by planning over a cost function- have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives. Nevertheless, state of the art planning based algorithms have shortcomings regarding their computational complexity and ability to predict for arbitrary time intervals. This paper addresses these shortcomings by leveraging alternative planning techniques (Fast Marching Method) and formulating efficient algorithms for goal estimation and full spatiotemporal prediction with lower complexity than comparable approaches. In preliminary experiments, the proposed method significantly outperforms the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art approach while reducing the computation time by a factor of 30 using a parallel version of our algorithm."

In such cases, it is useful to have a good predictive model of the object's motion to factor in when optimizing the robot's own behaviour. In this paper we consider motion models cast in the Predictive Linear Gaussian (PLG) model, and propose two learning approaches for this framework: one based on the method of moments and the other on a least-squares criteria. We evaluate the approaches on several synthetic datasets, and deploy the system on a wheelchair robot, to improve its ability to follow a walking companion."
icra,None,Interpreting multimodal referring expressions in real time,"David Whitney,Miles Eldon,John Oberlin,Stefanie Tellex,","Humans communicate about objects using language, gesture, and context, fusing information from multiple modalities over time. Robots need to interpret this communication in order to collaborate with humans on shared tasks. Processing communicative input incrementally has the potential to increase the speed and accuracy of a robot's reaction. It also enables the robot to incorporate the relative timing of words and gestures into the understanding process. To address this problem, we define a multimodal Bayes filter for interpreting a person's referential expressions to objects. Our approach outputs a distribution over the referent object at 14Hz, updating dynamically as it receives new observations of the person's spoken words and gestures. We collected a new dataset of people referring to one of four objects in a tabletop setting and demonstrate that our approach is able to infer the correct object with 90% accuracy. Additionally, we augment and improve our filter in a simulated home kitchen domain by learning contextual knowledge in an unsupervised manner from existing written text, increasing our maximum accuracy to 96%, even with an increase in the number of objects from four to seventy."

Cubimorph contributes toward the vision of programmable matter where interactive devices reconfigure in any shape that can be made out of a chain of cubes in order to fit a myriad of functionalities, e.g. a mobile phone shifting into a console when a user launches a game.

icra,None,Learning assistive strategies from a few user-robot interactions: Model-based reinforcement learning approach,"Masashi Hamaya,Takamitsu Matsubara,Tomoyuki Noda,Tatsuya Teramae,,","Designing an assistive strategy for exoskeletons is a key ingredient in movement assistance and rehabilitation. While several approaches have been explored, most studies are based on mechanical models of the human user, i.e., rigid-body dynamics or Center of Mass (CoM)-Zero Moment Point (ZMP) inverted pendulum moECenter of Massdel, or only focus on periodic movements with using oscillator models. On the other hand, the interactions between the user and the robot are often not considered explicitly because of its difficulty in modeling. In this paper, we propose to learn the assistive strategies directly from interactions between the user and the robot. We formulate the learning problem of assistive strategies as a policy search problem. To alleviate heavy burdens to the user for data acquisition, we exploit a data-efficient model-based reinforcement learning framework. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, an experimental platform composed of a real subject, an electromyography (EMG)-measurement system, and a simulated robot arm is developed. Then, a learning experiment with the assistive control task of the robot arm is conducted. As a result, proper assistive strategies that can achieve the robot control task and reduce EMG signals of the user are acquired only by 30 seconds interactions."

This model, which is informed by computer vision, human-robot interaction, and cognitive psychology, simulates how low-level and high-level features of the scene might draw a user's attention. It then selects the most appropriate robot behavior that maximizes the likelihood that a user will understand the correct object reference while minimizing the cost of the behavior. We present a general computational framework for this model, then describe a specific implementation in a human-robot collaboration. Finally, we analyze the model's performance in two human evaluations-one video-based (75 participants) and one in person (20 participants)-and demonstrate that the system predicts the correct behaviors to perform successful object references."
icra,None,An architectural approach to safety of component-based robotic systems,"Min Yang Jung,Peter Kazanzides,","Medical and surgical robot systems are examples of safety-critical systems due to the potential hazards that can lead to severe injury or the loss of human life. Furthermore, robot safety is becoming increasingly important in other domains as robots begin to share their workspace with humans. At the same time, the complexity of robot hardware and software has been increasing to endow them with capabilities for safe human-robot collaboration and other demanding tasks. While component-based frameworks have been widely adopted in robotics to manage the increasing scale and complexity of these systems, it is still challenging for both academic researchers and industrial developers to develop robot systems with safety in a reusable and structured manner. To address these issues, we reformulate safety as a visible, reusable, and verifiable property, rather than an embedded, hard-to-reuse, and hard-to-test property that is tightly coupled with the system. Specifically, we present a state-based model and a safety-oriented software architecture that allow us to reuse the design of safety features across different systems and different applications without relying on a particular component model. To demonstrate and evaluate the proposed methods, we built SAFECASS, an open source software framework that enables reuse of experience and knowledge on safety, and applied it to two medical robot systems, one of which is presented in this paper."
icra,None,Investigating spatial guidance for a cooperative handheld robot,"Austin Gregg-Smith,Walterio W. Mayol-Cuevas,","In this paper we address the question of how to provide feedback information to guide users of a handheld robotic device when performing a spatial exploration task. We consider various feedback methods for communicating a five degree of freedom target pose to a user including a stereoscopic VR display, a monocular see-through AR display and a 2D screen as well as robot arm gesturing. The spatial exploration task with the handheld robot arm was compared against a baseline of a passive handheld wand. We compared the performance of each of the methods with 21 volunteers using a repeated measures ANOVA experimental design, and recorded users' opinions via a NASA Task Load Index Survey. The robot assisted reaching feedback methods significantly outperform manual reaching with the wand for all three visual feedback methods. However, there is little difference between each of the three visual feedback methods when using the robot. The completion time of the task varies with changing difficulty when using the wand but remains stable when assisted by the robot. These results convey useful information for the design of cooperative handheld robots."
icra,None,Hierarchical action learning by instruction through interactive grounding of body parts and proto-actions,"Maxime Petit,Yiannis Demiris,","Learning by instruction allows humans programming a robot to achieve a task using spoken language, without the requirement of being able to do the task themselves, which can be problematic for users with motor impairments. We provide a developmental framework to program the humanoid robot iCub without any hand-coded a-priori knowledge about any motor skills. Inspired by child development theories, the system involves hierarchical learning, starting with the human verbally labelling robot body parts. The robot can then focus its attention on a precise body part during robot motor babbling, and link the on-the-fly spoken descriptions of proto-actions to angle values of a specific joint. The direct grounding of proto-actions is possible through the use of a linear model which calculates the effects on the joint of the proto-action and the body part used, allowing a generalisation of the proto-action if the joint has never been used before. Eventually, transferring the grounding is allowed via learning by instructions where humans can combine the newly acquired proto-actions to build primitives and more complex actions by scaffolding them. The framework has been validated using a humanoid robot iCub, which is able to learn without any prior knowledge: 1) the name of its fingers and the corresponding joint number, 2) how to fold and unfold them and 3) how to close or open its hand and how to show numbers with its fingers."
icra,None,RoboBench: Towards sustainable robotics system benchmarking,"Jonathan Weisz,Yipeng Huang,Florian Lier,Simha Sethumadhavan,,","We present RoboBench, a novel platform for sharing robot full-system simulations for benchmarking. The creation of this platform and benchmark suite is motivated by a need for reproducible research. A challenge in creating a full-system benchmarks are incompatibilities in software created by different groups and the difficulty of reproducing software environments. We solve this problem by using software containers, an emerging virtualization technology. RoboBench enables sharing robot software in a runnable state, capturing the software behavior of robots carrying out missions. These simulations make clear the performance impact and resource usage of programs and algorithms relative to other software involved in the mission. These containers are integrated with the CITK platform for reproducible research, which automates generation and publishing of the containers. We present an overview of the system, a description of our prototype set of benchmark missions, along with a validation study comparing the computational load profile of a mission performed on a real and simulated robot. Additionally, we present preliminary results of an overall analysis of the benchmarks in the RoboBench suite, showing where computational work is expended in robotics common robotics tasks. RoboBench is extensible, and is the first step toward a robust, quantitative approach to engineering computationally-efficient robots."
icra,None,Learning to remove multipath distortions in Time-of-Flight range images for a robotic arm setup,"Kilho Son,Ming-Yu Liu,Yuichi Taguchi,","Range images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras are corrupted with multipath distortions due to interaction between modulated light signals and scenes. The interaction is often complicated, which makes a model-based solution elusive. We propose a learning-based approach for removing the multipath distortions for a ToF camera in a robotic arm setup. Our approach is based on deep learning. We use the robotic arm to automatically collect a large amount of ToF range images containing various multipath distortions. The training images are automatically labeled by leveraging a high precision structured light sensor available only in the training time. In the test time, we apply the learned model to remove the multipath distortions. This allows our robotic arm setup to enjoy the speed and compact form of the ToF camera without compromising with its range measurement errors. We conduct extensive experimental validations and compare the proposed method to several baseline algorithms. The experiment results show that our method achieves 55% error reduction in range estimation and largely outperforms the baseline algorithms."
icra,None,Exemplar-based prediction of global object shape from local shape similarity,"Jeannette Bohg,Daniel Kappler,Stefan Schaal,","We propose a novel method that enables a robot to identify a graspable object part of an unknown object given only noisy and partial information that is obtained from an RGB-D camera. Our method combines the benefits of local with the advantages of global methods. It learns a classifier that takes a local shape representation as input and outputs the probability that a grasp applied at this location will be successful. Given a query data point that is classified in this way, we can retrieve all the locally similar training data points and use them to predict latent global object shape. This information may help to further prune positively labeled grasp hypotheses based on, e.g. relation to the predicted average global shape or suitability for a specific task. This prediction can also guide scene exploration to prune object shape hypotheses. To learn the function that maps local shape to grasp stability we use a Random Forest Classifier. We show that our method reaches the same classification performance as the current state-of-the-art on this dataset which uses a Convolutional Neural Network. Additionally, we exploit the natural ability of the Random Forest to cluster similar data. For a positively predicted query data point, we retrieve all the locally similar training data points that are associated with the same leaf nodes of the Random Forest. The main insight from this work is that local object shape that affords a grasp is also a good predictor of global object shape. We empirically support this claim with quantitative experiments. Additionally, we demonstrate the predictive capability of the method on some real data examples."
icra,None,Supersizing self-supervision: Learning to grasp from 50K tries and 700 robot hours,"Lerrel Pinto,Abhinav Gupta,","Current model free learning-based robot grasping approaches exploit human-labeled datasets for training the models. However, there are two problems with such a methodology: (a) since each object can be grasped in multiple ways, manually labeling grasp locations is not a trivial task; (b) human labeling is biased by semantics. While there have been attempts to train robots using trial-and-error experiments, the amount of data used in such experiments remains substantially low and hence makes the learner prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we take the leap of increasing the available training data to 40 times more than prior work, leading to a dataset size of 50K data points collected over 700 hours of robot grasping attempts. This allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of predicting grasp locations without severe overfitting. In our formulation, we recast the regression problem to an 18-way binary classification over image patches. We also present a multi-stage learning approach where a CNN trained in one stage is used to collect hard negatives in subsequent stages. Our experiments clearly show the benefit of using large-scale datasets (and multi-stage training) for the task of grasping. We also compare to several baselines and show state-of-the-art performance on generalization to unseen objects for grasping."
icra,None,Wavelets-based 6 DOF visual servoing,"Mouloud Ourak,Brahim Tamadazte,Olivier Lehmann,Nicolas Andreff,","This paper presents the development of a new visual servoing control law using global information image. It consists in the use of the wavelet spatial coefficients as the visual signal to design visual controller. More precisely, we introduce the concept of multiple resolution interaction matrix that links the time-variation of wavelet coefficients to the robot spatial velocity and the associated task function controller. The proposed controller was successfully validated using a 6 degrees-of-freedom 3PPSR parallel kinematic manipulator in an eye-to-hand configuration. Experimental results show the accuracy, efficiency and show good behavior of such features."
icra,None,Towards Ultrasound-based visual servoing using shearlet coefficients,"Lesley-Ann Duflot,Alexandre Krupa,Brahim Tamadazte,Nicolas Andreff,","This paper deals with the development of a new 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vision-based controller for robot-assisted medical applications. The main objective is to use visual information extracted from Ultrasounds (US) images to control an US probe held by a robot. Instead of the conventional use of visual features e.g., geometric features (points, lines, moments, etc.) in the visual control law design, the described method uses the shearlet coefficients. More precisely, the time-variation of the coarsest level of shearlet decomposition coefficients are linked to the US probe (respectively to the robot) spatial velocity and then related to the task-function control law. The proposed control law was experimentally tested and validated using a realistic abdominal phantom. The obtained results demonstrated promising performances in terms of accuracy, repeatability, robustness and convergence behavior."
icra,None,Visual servoing of a medical ultrasound probe for needle insertion,"Kim Mathiassen,Kyrre Glette,Ole Jakob Elle,","Percutaneous needle insertion guided by ultrasound imaging is routinely performed in hospitals today. Automating these procedures could increase placement accuracy and lower time usage of health care personnel to perform these procedures. An important step in the automation is the estimation of the needle orientation and position in the ultrasound image. One approach to estimate the needle orientation and position is to have the needle aligned with the image plane of the ultrasound probe. Aligning the needle with the plane is difficult, even with accurate measurements and calibration of both needle and probe. In this paper we propose a visual servoing method to move the ultrasound probe, using a robot to align the image plane of the probe with the needle. The method segments the needle and updates a set of visual features based on a model of the needle. A state machine is used to keep track of the alignment process, and different visual features are used to control the probe in the different states. Both simulation using simple synthetic images and experiments in a water tank are conducted to validate the proposed method. The simulation shows that the proposed method manages to align the probe plane with the needle. The alignment process is slower in the actual robot experiment, but still aligns the probe plane with the needle. The method is shown to work under simplified conditions, and is a step towards a method that could be applied in a clinical setting."
icra,None,ViTa: Visual task specification interface for manipulation with uncalibrated visual servoing,"Mona Gridseth,Oscar Ramirez,Camilo Perez Quintero,Martin Jagersand,","We present a human robot interface (HRI) for semi-autonomous human-in-the-loop control, that aims to tackle some of the challenges for robotics in unstructured environments. Our HRI lets the user specify desired object alignments in an image editor as geometric overlays on images. The HRI is based on the technique of visual task specification [1], which provides a well studied theoretical framework. Tasks are completed using uncalibrated image-based visual servoing (UVS). Our interface is shown to be effective for a versatile set of tasks that span both coarse and fine manipulation. We complete tasks such as inserting a marker in its cap, inserting a small cube in a shape sorter, grasping a circular lid, following a line, grasping a screw, cutting along a line, picking and placing a box and grasping a cylinder using a Barrett WAM arm and hand."
icra,None,Confidence-driven control of an ultrasound probe: Target-specific acoustic window optimization,"Pierre Chatelain,Alexandre Krupa,Nassir Navab,","We propose a control framework to optimize the quality of robotic ultrasound imaging while tracking an anatomical target. We use a multitask approach to control the in-plane motion of a convex probe mounted on the end-effector of a robotic arm, based not only on the position of the target in the image, but also on features extracted from an ultrasound confidence map. The resulting control law therefore guarantees a good image quality, while keeping the target aligned with the central ultrasound scan-line. Potential applications of the proposed approach are, for example, teleoperated ultrasound examination, motion compensation for ultrasound-guided interventions, or automatic ultrasound acquisition. We demonstrate our approach with experiments on an ultrasound examination training phantom in motion."
icra,None,Discriminative learning based visual servoing across object instances,"Harit Pandya,K. Madhava Krishna,C. V. Jawahar,","Classical visual servoing approaches use visual features based on geometry of the object such as points, lines, region, etc. to attain the desired camera pose. However, geometrical features are not suited for visual servoing across different object instances due to large variations in appearance and shape. In this paper, we present a new framework for visual servoing across object instances. Our approach is based on a discriminative learning framework where the desired pose is estimated using previously seen examples. Specifically, we learn a binary classifier that separates the desired pose from all other poses for that object category. The classification error is then used to control the end-effector so that the desired pose is attained. We present controllers for linear, kernel and exemplar Support Vector Machine (SVM) and empirically discuss their performance in the visual servoing context. To address large intra-category variation in appearance, we propose a modified version of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features for visual servoing. We show effective servoing across diverse instances over 3 object categories with zero terminal velocity and acceptable camera pose error at termination."
icra,None,A sparse snapshot-based navigation strategy for UAS guidance in natural environments,"Aymeric Denuelle,Mandyam V. Srinivasan,","This paper presents a novel visual navigation strategy applied to real-time guidance and control of autonomous rotorcraft in outdoor environments. The proposed approach acquires a sequence of snapshots during an initial exploratory journey and computes the rotorcraft's 3D position and velocity relative to the locations of these memorised snaphots during its long-range homing return. This mapless algorithm provides an efficient strategy that enables route learning and drift-free navigation in unknown and unstructured 3D environments, based on a simple and sparse visual route description. The performance of our approach is evaluated in closed-loop flight experiments onboard a small-size rotorcraft. Dynamic path optimisation is observed when navigating back and forth between two locations of interest."

Valavanis,","This paper proposes a real-time system for pose estimation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using parallel image processing of a known marker. The system exploits the capabilities of a high-performance CPU/GPU embedded system in order to provide on-board high-frequency pose estimation, eliminating the need for transmitting the video stream off-board, and enabling autonomous takeoff and landing. The system is evaluated extensively with lab and field tests on board a small quadrotor. The results show that the proposed system is able to provide precise pose estimation with a framerate of at least 30 fps and an image resolution of 640×480 pixels. The use of the GPU for image filtering and marker detection provides an upper bound on the required computation time regardless of the complexity of the image thereby allowing for robust marker detection even in cluttered environments."
icra,None,Multi-robot visual support system by adaptive ROI selection based on gestalt perception,"Shouta Samejima,Kosuke Sekiyama,","This paper deals with a visual assistance system for a remote control of a working robot. While an operator controls the working robot, an another autonomous monitoring robot evaluates a suitable viewpoint to capture the working situation, and dynamically moves to the optimal viewpoint for monitoring. The monitoring robot detects a gestalt of the scene, where a latent and expected interactive objects are included in the region of interest (ROI). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is a probabilistic topic model, is employed to judge the degree of risk around the working robot. Such a situated ROI is transmitted to the operator in real time. Experimental results shows that the proposed system can enhance the remote control mission by reducing the occurrence of error significantly."
icra,None,An information gain formulation for active volumetric 3D reconstruction,"Stefan Isler,Reza Sabzevari,Jeffrey Delmerico,Davide Scaramuzza,","We consider the problem of next-best view selection for volumetric reconstruction of an object by a mobile robot equipped with a camera. Based on a probabilistic volumetric map that is built in real time, the robot can quantify the expected information gain from a set of discrete candidate views. We propose and evaluate several formulations to quantify this information gain for the volumetric reconstruction task, including visibility likelihood and the likelihood of seeing new parts of the object. These metrics are combined with the cost of robot movement in utility functions. The next best view is selected by optimizing these functions, aiming to maximize the likelihood of discovering new parts of the object. We evaluate the functions with simulated and real world experiments within a modular software system that is adaptable to other robotic platforms and reconstruction problems. We release our implementation open source."
icra,None,Design of a highly biomimetic anthropomorphic robotic hand towards artificial limb regeneration,"Zhe Xu,Emanuel Todorov,","A wide range of research areas, from telemanipulation in robotics to limb regeneration in tissue engineering, could benefit from an anthropomorphic robotic hand that mimics the salient features of the human hand. The challenges of designing such a robotic hand are mainly resulted from our limited understanding of the human hand from engineering point of view and our ability to replicate the important biomechanical features with conventional mechanical design. We believe that the biomechanics of human hand is an essential component of the hand dexterity and can be replicated with highly biomimetic design. To this end, we reinterpret the important biomechanical advantages of the human hand from roboticist's perspective and design a biomimetic robotic hand that closely mimics its human counterpart with artificial joint capsules, crocheted ligaments and tendons, laser-cut extensor hood, and elastic pulley mechanisms. We experimentally identify the workspaces of the fingertips and successfully demonstrate that our proofof- concept design can be teleoperated to grasp and manipulate daily objects with a variety of natural hand postures based on hand taxonomy."
icra,None,Experimental implementation of underactuated potential energy shaping on a powered ankle-foot orthosis,"Ge Lv,Hanqi Zhu,Toby Elery,Luwei Li,Robert D. Gregg,","Traditional control methodologies of rehabilitation orthoses/exoskeletons aim at replicating normal kinematics and thus fall into the category of kinematic control. This control paradigm depends on pre-defined reference trajectories, which can be difficult to adjust between different locomotor tasks and human subjects. An alternative control category, kinetic control, enforces kinetic goals (e.g., torques or energy) instead of kinematic trajectories, which could provide a flexible learning environment for the user while freeing up therapists to make corrections. We propose that the theory of underactuated potential energy shaping, which falls into the category of kinetic control, could be used to generate virtual body-weight support for stroke gait rehabilitation. After deriving the nonlinear control law and simulating it on a human-like biped model, we implemented this controller on a powered ankle-foot orthosis that was designed specifically for testing torque control strategies. Experimental results with an able-bodied human subject demonstrate the feasibility of the control approach for both positive and negative virtual body-weight augmentation."
icra,None,IMU-based iterative control for hip extension assistance with a soft exosuit,"Ye Ding,Ignacio Galiana,Christopher Siviy,Fausto A. Panizzolo,,","In this paper we describe an IMU-based iterative controller for hip extension assistance where the onset timing of assistance is based on an estimate of the maximum hip flexion angle. The controller was implemented on a mono-articular soft exosuit coupled to a lab-based multi-joint actuation platform that enables rapid reconfiguration of different sensors and control strategy implementation. The controller design is motivated by a model of the suit-human interface and utilizes an iterative control methodology that includes gait detection and step-by-step actuator position profile generation to control the onset timing, peak timing, and peak magnitude of the delivered force. This controller was evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.5 m/s while carrying a load of 23 kg. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across subjects. Specifically, for a given profile, the average delivered force started concurrently with the timing of the maximum hip flexion angle and reached its peak timing 22.7 ± 0.63% later in the gait cycle (desired 23%) with a peak magnitude of 198.2 ± 1.6 N (desired 200 N), equivalent to an average peak torque of 30.5 ± 4.7 Nm. This control approach was used to assess the metabolic effect of four different assistive profiles. Metabolic reductions ranging from 5.7% to 8.5% were found when comparing the powered conditions with the unpowered condition. This work enables studies to assess the biomechanical and physiological responses to different assistive profiles to determine the optimal hip extension assistance during walking."
icra,None,Controlling negative and positive power at the ankle with a soft exosuit,"Sangjun Lee,Simona Crea,Philippe Malcolm,Ignacio Galiana,Alan Asbeck,,","The soft exosuit is a new approach for applying assistive forces over the wearer's body through load paths configured by the textile architecture. In this paper, we present a body-worn lower-extremity soft exosuit and a new control approach that can independently control the level of assistance that is provided during negative- and positive-power periods at the ankle. The exosuit was designed to create load paths assisting ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion, and the actuation system transmits forces from the motors to the suit via Bowden cables. A load cell and two gyro sensors per leg are used to measure real-time data, and the controller performs position control of the cable on a step-by-step basis with respect to the power delivered to the wearer's ankle by controlling two force parameters, the pretension and the active force. Human subjects testing results demonstrate that the controller is capable of modulating the amount of power delivered to the ankle joint. Also, significant reductions in metabolic rate (11%-15%) were observed, which indicates the potential of the proposed control approach to provide benefit to the wearer during walking."
icra,None,SoftHand Pro-D: Matching dynamic content of natural user commands with hand embodiment for enhanced prosthesis control,"Cristina Piazza,Cosimo Della Santina,Manuel Catalano,Giorgio Grioli,,,","State of the art of hand prosthetics is divided between simple and reliable gripper-like systems and sophisticate hi-tech poly-articular hands which tend to be complex both in their design and for the patient to operate. In this paper, we introduce the idea of decoding different movement intentions of the patient using the dynamic frequency content of the control signals in a natural way. We move a step further showing how this idea can be embedded in the mechanics of an underactuated soft hand by using only passive damping components. In particular we devise a method to design the hand hardware to obtain a given desired motion. This method, that we call of the dynamic synergies, builds on the theory of linear descriptor systems, and is based on the division of the hand movement in a slow and a fast components. We use this method to evolve the design of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand in a prototype prosthesis which, while still having 19 degrees of freedom and just one motor, can move along two different synergistic directions of motion (and combinations of the two), to perform either a pinch or a power grasp. Preliminary experimental results are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed design."

The real-time detection of an object slippage during grasping plays a fundamental role in performing a stable grasp. Aim of this paper is to propose and test (i) a system for object slippage detection during grasping, (ii) a control strategy for grasping force regulation and slippage prevention and (iii) a finger coordination method for replicating on the prosthesis system a human-like behaviour. The approach has been validated on a real prosthetic hand, i.e. the IH2 Azzurra (developed by Prensilia), on which tips force sensing resistors have been placed. The preliminary experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of the methods for slipping detection and for force/slippage control and have shown that the prosthetic hand is able to perform a stable pinch grasp of different objects guaranteeing finger coordination."
icra,None,Active Impedance Control of a lower limb exoskeleton to assist sit-to-stand movement,"Weiguang Huo,Samer Mohammed,Yacine Amirat,Kyoungchul Kong,","As an important movement of the daily living activities, sit-to-stand (STS) movement is usually a difficult task facing elderly and dependent people. To provide appropriate power assistance for the sit-to-stand movement, a novel intention-based Active Impedance Control (AIC) strategy applied on a lower limb exoskeleton is proposed in this paper. The AIC is able to adapt the mechanical impedance of the human-exoskeleton system towards a desired one using the exoskeleton's power assistance. In the AIC structure, a human joint torque observer is designed to estimate the human joint torques using joint angles information instead of electromyography (EMG) or force/torque sensors; a time-varying desired impedance model is proposed according the wearer's lower limb motion ability. Simulations were implemented to illustrate the characteristics and performances of the proposed approach. Experiments with a healthy subject were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments show satisfactory results in terms of appropriate power assist based on the wearer's motion intention."

The glove utilizes soft fabric-regulated pneumatic actuators that are low-profile and require lower pressure than previously developed actuators. They are able to support fingers and thumb motions during hand closure. Upon pressurization, the actuators are able to generate sufficient force to assist in hand closing and grasping during different manipulation tasks. In this work, experiments were conducted to evaluate the performances of the actuators as well as the glove in terms of its kinetic and kinematic assistance on a healthy participant. Additionally, surface electromyography and radio-frequency identification techniques were adopted to detect user intent to activate or deactivate the glove. Lastly, we present preliminary results of a healthy participant performing different manipulation tasks with the soft robotic glove controlled by surface electromyography and radio-frequency identification techniques."
icra,None,An energy-efficient torque controller based on passive dynamics of human locomotion for a robotic transtibial prosthesis,"Kebin Yuan,Qining Wang,Long Wang,","During early and middle stance of level-ground walking, the ankle joint usually rotates passively due to the locomotion of human body. Based on this passive dynamics of human locomotion, we develop an energy-efficient torque controller with hierarchical structure for a robotic prosthesis. The low-level controller generates motor current from the human locomotion and controls the motor current/torque according to the high-level command. The high-level controller consists of a forward estimator and a feedback compensator. The forward estimator estimates the motor torque according to the desired ankle torque based on the prosthesis model that represents the transmission gain between the motor torque and the ankle torque. The feedback compensator compensates for the model and low-level control errors based on the torque measurements. Step response and frequency response show that the low-level controller could reach the desired value within 0.3 seconds and had a bandwidth of 4.2 Hz. Experiments of constant and linear torque tracking achieve small RMS tracking errors, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed high-level controller."
icra,None,Investigation of a cognitive strain on hand grasping induced by sensory feedback for myoelectric hand,"Hiroshi Yamada,Yusuke Yamanoi,Ko Wakita,Ryu Kato,","The purpose of this study is to investigate how sensory feedback affects the cognitive strain of grasping using a prosthesis and to develop an efficient method for decreasing the cognitive strain of grasping. We divided a grasping action into two phases, an “approaching phase” and a “grasping phase”, and assumed that the tactile feedback affect for the cognitive strain induced by grasping phase and the deep sensory feedback affect for cognitive strain induced by approaching phase. Using dual-task method, we compared the effect of sensory feedback method using strength-changed simulator or using spatially changed stimulators. As a result, we concluded that the sensory feedback can decrease the cognitive strain of grasping action, and the sensory feedback from one strength-changed stimulator is better than the one from spatially changed stimulators to decrease a cognitive strain caused by grasping action."
icra,None,A versatile and efficient pattern generator for generalized legged locomotion,"Justin Carpentier,Steve Tonneau,Maximilien Naveau,Olivier Stasse,,","This paper presents a generic and efficient approach to generate dynamically consistent motions for under-actuated systems like humanoid or quadruped robots. The main contribution is a walking pattern generator, able to compute a stable trajectory of the center of mass of the robot along with the angular momentum, for any given configuration of contacts (e.g. on uneven, sloppy or slippery terrain, or with closed-gripper). Unlike existing methods, our solver is fast enough to be applied as a model-predictive controller. We then integrate this pattern generator in a complete framework: an acyclic contact planner is first used to automatically compute the contact sequence from a 3D model of the environment and a desired final posture; a stable walking pattern is then computed by the proposed solver; a dynamically-stable whole-body trajectory is finally obtained using a second-order hierarchical inverse kinematics. The implementation of the whole pipeline is fast enough to plan a step while the previous one is executed. The interest of the method is demonstrated by real experiments on the HRP-2 robot, by performing long-step walking and climbing a staircase with handrail support."
icra,None,3-DOF passive dynamic walking of compass-like biped robot with semicircular feet generated on slippery downhill,"Fumihiko Asano,Toshiaki Saka,Yuji Harata,","The authors demonstrated that a stable passive compass gait can be generated on a slippery downhill, and showed that the 2-DOF constraint conditions for the contact point are not always necessary for it. The generated walking gait while sliding on the slope becomes 3-DOF increased by addition of the positional coordinate of the contact point. This paper then investigates the effects of semicircular feet on the 3-DOF passive compass gait. First, we develop the equations of a 4-DOF passive compass-like biped robot with semicircular feet that slides on a slippery downhill. Second, we derive the term of the sliding friction force and discuss the complexity and relationship with holonomic constraint condition. Third, we perform numerical simulations to observe the typical 3-DOF passive walking motion and change in the gait properties according to the foot radius."
icra,None,Model-based bounding on a quadruped robot,"Chun-Kai Huang,Chung-Li Chen,Chia-Jui Hu,Pei-Chun Lin,","We report on the development of a robot's dynamic bounding locomotion based on a sagittal plane model that fits the robot's natural dynamics. The proposed model, referred to as the Two-rolling-leg (TRL) model, is a low degree-of-freedom planar rigid-body model with two rolling and compliant legs. The numerical fixed point analyses of the model suggest that with the adequate touchdown conditions of the model, passive dynamic and periodic behaviors of bounding is achievable. The passive dynamic behaviors of the model then serve as a guidance to initiate bounding on a quadruped. The experimental results show that though several un-modeled factors cause the behavioral discrepancy between the TRL model and the robot, the robot can still initiate its dynamic bounding behaviors by mapping the corresponding leg trajectories of the model on the empirical robot using a simple pre-set position control strategy without any state feedback. This work confirms that the complex gait behavior of the robot can be initiated by adopting the simple reduced-order model as the control target for behavioral guidance."
icra,None,Robot locomotion on hard and soft ground: Measuring stability and ground properties in-situ,"Will Bosworth,Jonas Whitney,Sangbae Kim,Neville Hogan,","Dynamic behavior of legged robots is strongly affected by ground impedance. Empirical observation of robot hardware is needed because ground impedance and foot-ground interaction is challenging to predict in simulation. This paper presents experimental data of the MIT Super Mini Cheetah robot hopping on hard and soft ground. We show that controllers tuned for each surface perform better for each specific surface type, assessing performance using measurements of 1.) stability of the robot in response to self-disturbances applied by the robot onto itself and 2.) the peak accelerations of the robot that occur during ground impact, which should be minimized to reduce mechanical stress. To aid in controller selection on different ground types, we show that the robot can measure ground stiffness and friction in-situ by measuring its own interaction with the ground. To motivate future work in variable-terrain control and in-situ ground measurement, we show preliminary results of running gaits that transition between hard and soft ground."

In this paper, we generate a pronking gait on a quadruped robot using a controller, which takes into account the effects of ground deformation. The controller, initially developed for monopods, is modified appropriately to operate for quadrupeds. The robot uses a reaction wheel to retain a desired body pitch. The dynamic models of leg motor drivetrains and of the reaction wheel are incorporated and their importance in the design of legged robots is highlighted. Simulation results show good performance in reaching commanded apex heights and forward velocities when traversing various deformable terrains, demonstrating that the developed controller is quite promising."

Legged robots such as hexapod robots produce rich acoustic information for each gait cycle which includes the foot fall sounds and feet pushing on the terrain (support phase), as well as the sounds produced when the feet travel through the air (stride phase). Interpreting this information to perceive the terrain it is traversing makes available another valuable sensing modality which can feed in to higher level systems to facilitate robust and efficient navigation through unknown terrain.We present an online realtime terrain classification system for legged robots that utilise features from the acoustic signals produced during locomotion. A 32-dimensional feature vector extracted from acoustic data recorded using an on-board microphone was fed in to a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM was trained on 7 different terrain types and the results of the experimental evaluations are presented. The system was implemented using the Robotic Operating System (ROS) for real-time terrain classification. A classification time-resolution of 1 s was achieved by capturing acoustic signals of two steps, and the results show a true positive rate (sensitivity) of up to 92.9%. We also present a noise subtraction technique which removes servo noise and improves the sensitivity up to 95.1%."
icra,None,Road following with blind crawling robot,"Martin Stejskal,Jakub Mrva,Jan Faigl,","In this paper, we consider road following to autonomously navigate a mobile robot through an environment while keeping the robot on the specified road. Contrary to existing approaches based on a forward looking camera, we consider the problem for a technically blind walking robot without any exteroceptive sensors. The only feedback considered is an estimation of tactile information that is determined from the robot servo drives. The proposed control law is based on an on-line classification of the previously learned terrains which is utilized to identify a situation when a robot starts to crawl off the desired road terrain. The controller steers the robot to keep its body and all its legs on the road while crawling forward with a constant velocity. The experimental results support feasibility of the proposed minimalistic approach and allows the robot to autonomously navigate in an outdoor environment and follow urban park pathways and avoid off-road parts."
icra,None,Towards a multi-legged mobile manipulator,"Bilal Ur Rehman,Michele Focchi,Jinoh Lee,Houman Dallali,Darwin G. Caldwell,,","A common disadvantage of multi-legged robots is that they often lack the manipulation capability. To overcome this limitation, an arm can be added to the body of the multi-legged robot, to perform manipulation tasks and provide assistance for locomotion. First, we proposed an attachment configuration of the arm for a multi-legged robot that provide a uniform workspace in front, below and above the base robot trunk. Second, an integrated control framework promises to keep the mobility and the balance of the mobile platform and provides precise manipulation capability of the arm incorporating a payload estimation scheme. Finally, we verify an integrated control framework with experimental results of a static and walking mobile platform while moving the arm."
icra,None,Beyond layers: A 3D-aware toolpath algorithm for fused filament fabrication,"Samuel Lensgraf,Ramgopal R. Mettu,","Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is gaining traction for rapid prototyping and custom fabrication. Existing toolpath generation methods for FFF printers take as input a three-dimensional model of the target object and construct a layered toolpath that will fabricate the object in 2D slices of a chosen thickness. While this approach is computationally straightforward, it can produce toolpaths that can contain significant, yet unnecessary, extrusionless travel. In this paper we propose a novel 3D toolpath generation paradigm that leverages local feature independence in the target object. In contrast to existing FFF slicing methods which print an object layer by layer, our algorithm provides a means to print local features of an object without being constrained to a single layer. The key benefit of our approach is a tremendous reduction in “extrusionless travel,” in which the printer must move between features without performing any extrusion. We show on a benchmark of 409 objects that our method can yield substantial savings in extrusionless travel, 34% on average, that can directly translate to a reduction in total manufacturing time."
icra,None,Robust control of automated manufacturing systems with assembly operations using petri nets,"Nan Du,Hesuan Hu,Yang Liu,","Automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) with complex topologies have become increasingly active in the area of research. However, a prerequisite is indispensable for numerous researchers to investigate AMSs. That is resources are presumptively and arbitrarily assumed never to fail; nevertheless, this does not completely match the reality. In this paper, we consider deadlock and blocking problems in AMSs with unreliable resources and assembly operations. Our objective is to develop a robust supervisory control policy that allocates resources so that parts requiring the failed resource do not block the production of parts not necessarily requiring the failed resource in case any unreliable resource fails unexpectedly. Conventional methods are based on structure-oriented and monolithic specifications. On the contrary, our supervisory policy looks ahead to anticipate whether currently-available resources are enough in their quantity to assist a concerned token to reach its desired destination without knowing the global information. Our strategy is achieved in a local and dynamic manner. It can effectively respond to resource failures."
icra,None,Tying knot precisely,"Weifu Wang,Devin Balkcom,","Simply pulling on the ends of string is sufficient to tighten simple knots such as the overhand knot, but many knots used for decoration or binding need to be tightened at particular locations along the string. For example, a shoelace knot should have equally-sized bows, as should a decorative cloverleaf knot. Knots tied in sounding lines (historically used to measure depth in the ocean) must be placed at precise distances apart. Precise control of tying also allows tangling to be avoided in complex knots. This paper explores an approach to tying knots precisely, so that friction locks occur at specified locations along the string. First, the knot is laid out on a fixture using an arm and a specialized gripper; then, the fixture contracts as string is pulled to tighten the knot. This is the first work we know of in robotic manipulation focused on precise knot tightening (rather than loose arrangement), and presents tying of a fairly complex decorative knot, the Ruyi knot, as a proof of concept. The fixtures are each specific to particular knots, but are designed automatically using the algorithm presented."
icra,None,Grasping and folding knots,"Weifu Wang,Devin Balkcom,","String stretched tightly along a sequence of fixed grasp points takes the shape of a polygonal arc. In this work, we investigate how many points are necessary and sufficient to grasp and tie arbitrary knots while maintaining tension, so that the string remains polygonal. This approach allows reasoning that is entirely geometric, which does not rely on potentially inaccurate dynamic models of the string or detailed knowledge of physical characteristics of the string. Algorithms are proposed to determine the contact locations, and generate the motions needed to tie arbitrary knots. This work shows that a number of grasp points that is linear in the number of crossings in a knot diagram is sufficient to immobilize string in a polygonal shape with the topology of an arbitrary knot, or to fold or unfold the knot from a straight configuration."
icra,None,Robotic folding of 2D and 3D structures from a ribbon,"Liyu Wang,Mark M. Plecnik,Ronald S. Fearing,","Automatic folding has drawn increasing attention in robotics research in the past ten years. The focus has been on folding two-dimensional (2D) sheets into three-dimensional (3D) structures, but little work has been done on how structures may be formed by folding ribbons. Here we propose the concept of robotic ribbon folding including a general workflow from shape design to ribbon folding and shape retention. We also propose a method to realize robotic ribbon folding on the macroscopic scale. The method consists of minimally engineered ribbons with patterned flexures, a folding robot, and a folding scheme that relates the orientation of flexures, the type of folds and the type of structural elements. By using this method we demonstrate robotic ribbon folding into 2D static structures such as triangles and squares, 3D static structures, and planar kinematic linkages such as a simple non-crossing four-bar mechanism. Burn-in result shows a four-bar mechanism with all bars' length of 5 cm could move for over 660 cycles."
icra,None,An automated system for investigating sperm orientation in fluid flow,"Zhuoran Zhang,Jun Liu,Jim Meriano,Changhai Ru,Shaorong Xie,,,","Mammalian sperms reorient against fluid flow in the female reproductive tract, known as rheotaxis. Compared to chemotaxis that provides short-distance guidance, rheotaxis provides long-distance guidance for a sperm to find the egg cell. However, only a low number of sperms are capable of rheotaxis and their tail behavior during reorientation is not yet known. We have developed an automated system to manipulate human sperm orientation in fluid flow and quantitatively reveal sperm behavior changes during rheotaxis. The system automatically detects multiple sperms, selects the sperm for analysis, controls fluid flow, and quantifies sperm tail behavior. Sperm head angle is used as feedback to control fluid flow and select reorienting sperms. High accuracy of head angle tracking and automated sperm selection enables the capturing of dynamic sperm turning behavior in a large sample size. Algorithms are developed to track sperm tail skeletons and quantify tail beating amplitude and asymmetry, based on which the first quantitative analysis of sperm tail behavior in rheotaxis is obtained. Experimental results reveal, for the first time, that the sperms that are capable of reorienting against fluid flow beat their tails more asymmetrically than those sperms that are unable to reorient against fluid flow while no significant difference was found in their tail beating amplitudes."
icra,None,Distributed supervisor synthesis for automated manufacturing systems with flexible routes and assembly operations using Petri nets,"Chen Chen,Yan Yang,Hesuan Hu,","Automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) are developing rapidly with increasingly sophisticated operations and complex topologies. In this paper, we propose a new kind of AMS structure, namely, AESMs, with processes expressed by flexible routes and embedded by marked graph blocks. Flexible routes and assembly operations are combined organically in this model, making it structurally complex and applicably adaptable. Deadlock resolution in AMSs is a fundamental and prerequisite issue. Conventional approach is based on monolithic methodologies by means of siphons, i.e., a special structural object closely related to deadlocks. Analysis shows that siphon-based mechanism is of limited applicability to control AESMs. On the contrary, we utilize a distributed approach in accordance with the philosophy of model predictive control techniques, which can create a trajectory dynamically leading the entire system to its desired destination. In our strategy, whether or not concerned tokens can reach critical places or critical place unities determines the feasibility of each step's execution. Control strategy is applied to processes locally such that they can concurrently proceed at the same pace. Global goals become attainable through the local observation, control, and execution upon local processes without knowing external and extra information."
icra,None,Simultaneous model identification and task satisfaction in the presence of temporal logic constraints,"Sandeep P. Chinchali,Scott C. Livingston,Marco Pavone,Joel W. Burdick,","Recent proliferation of cyber-physical systems, ranging from autonomous cars to nuclear hazard inspection robots, has exposed several challenging research problems on automated fault detection and recovery. This paper considers how recently developed formal synthesis and model verification techniques may be used to automatically generate information-seeking trajectories for anomaly detection. In particular, we consider the problem of how a robot could select its actions so as to maximally disambiguate between different model hypotheses that govern the environment it operates in or its interaction with other agents whose prime motivation is a priori unknown. The identification problem is posed as selection of the most likely model from a set of candidates, where each candidate is an adversarial Markov decision process (MDP) together with a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula that constrains robot-environment interaction. An adversarial MDP is an MDP in which transitions depend on both a (controlled) robot action and an (uncontrolled) adversary action. States are labeled, thus allowing interpretation of satisfaction of LTL formulae, which have a special form admitting satisfaction decisions in bounded time. An example where a robotic car must discern whether neighboring vehicles are following its trajectory for a surveillance operation is used to demonstrate our approach."
icra,None,Optimal temporal logic planning in probabilistic semantic maps,"Jie Fu,Nikolay Atanasov,Ufuk Topcu,George J. Pappas,",This paper considers robot motion planning under temporal logic constraints in probabilistic maps obtained by semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The uncertainty in a map distribution presents a great challenge for obtaining correctness guarantees with respect to the linear temporal logic (LTL) specification. We show that the problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem in which both the semantic map and the logic formula evaluation are stochastic. Our first contribution is to reduce the stochastic control problem for a subclass of LTL to a deterministic shortest path problem by introducing a confidence parameter δ. A robot trajectory obtained from the deterministic problem is guaranteed to have minimum cost and to satisfy the logic specification in the true environment with probability δ. Our second contribution is to design an admissible heuristic function that guides the planning in the deterministic problem towards satisfying the temporal logic specification. This allows us to obtain an optimal and very efficient solution using the A* algorithm. The performance and correctness of our approach are demonstrated in a simulated semantic environment using a differential-drive robot.
icra,None,Unilateral walking surface stiffness perturbations evoke brain responses: Toward bilaterally informed robot-assisted gait rehabilitation,"Jeffrey Skidmore,Panagiotis Artemiadis,","Gait impairment due to neurological disorders has become an important problem of the 21st century. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability with approximately 90% of stroke survivors having some functional disability, with mobility being a major impairment. Despite the growing interest in using robotic devices for rehabilitation of sensorimotor function, their widespread use remains somewhat limited, as results so far in gait rehabilitation do not generally show improved outcomes over traditional treadmill-based therapy. This work focuses on understanding the mechanisms of inter-leg coordination, and based on that, proposing novel methods for gait rehabilitation. Using a novel robotic device, the Variable Stiffness Treadmill (VST), we apply walking surface stiffness perturbations to one leg, and analyze the response of the human nervous system in both low- (muscle) and high- (brain) levels, focusing on the mechanisms involved in the response of the other (unperturbed) leg. We show that the unperturbed leg uniquely responds to unilateral stiffness perturbations, while we provide solid evidence that the brain is involved in this observed inter-leg coordination. From a clinical prospective, the results of this study can be disruptive since they suggest that supraspinal neural activity can be evoked by altering the stiffness of the walking surface. Moreover, our methods provide a safe and targeted way to provide gait rehabilitation in hemiparesis since direct manipulation of the paretic side is not required. The present work provides for the first time evidence that specific robotic intervention in gait rehabilitation can have direct and predictable effects on the brain, opening a new avenue of research on targeted robot-assisted gait rehabilitation."
icra,None,Redundant kinematics and workspace centering control of AssistOn-Gait overground gait and balance trainer,"Hammad Munawar,Mustafa Yalcin,Volkan Patoglu,","We present the redundant kinematics and workspace centering control of AssistOn-Gait, an overground gait and balance trainer designed to deliver pelvis-hip exercises to correct compensatory movements arising from abnormal gait patterns. AssistOn-Gait consists of an impedance controlled pelvis-hip exoskeleton module, supported by a motion controlled holonomic mobile platform. The exoskeleton module possesses 7 active degrees of freedom to independently control the rotation of the each hip in the sagittal plane along with the pelvic tilt, pelvic rotation and the horizontal, vertical and lateral displacements of the pelvis. The holonomic mobile base can track the movements of patients on flat surfaces, allowing patients to walk naturally, start/stop motion, vary their speed, sidestep to maintain balance and turn to change their walking direction. The kinematics of AssistOn-Gait is redundant, as the exoskeleton module spans all the degrees of freedom covered by the mobile platform. The device features dual layer actuation, since the exoskeleton module is designed for force control with good transparency, while the mobile base is designed for motion control to carry the weight of the patient and the exoskeleton. The kinematically redundant dual layer actuation enables the mobile base of the system to be controlled using workspace centering control strategy without the need for any additional sensors, since the patient movements are readily measured by the exoskeleton module. The workspace centering controller ensures that the workspace limits of the exoskeleton module are not reached, decoupling the dynamics of the mobile base from the exoskeleton dynamics. Consequently, AssistOn-Gait possesses virtually unlimited workspace, while featuring the same output impedance and force rendering performance as its exoskeleton module"

This apparatus assists only the ankle joints of the equipped person according to the posture of him/her while not only walking, but also getting up, sitting, and standing. By using this apparatus, the dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the ankle joint of the equipped person can increase while walking. This apparatus can improve of the equipped person's gait."
icra,None,Estimation of tremor parameters and extraction tremor from recorded signals for tremor suppression,"Shengxin Wang,Yongsheng Gao,Feiyun Xiao,Xizhe Zang,Yanhe Zhu,,","Pathological tremor is defined as a roughly sinusoidal movement and usually occurs in the upper limb impacting individuals activities of daily livings. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is proposed as a potential alternative for cancelling the pathological tremor. However, the feasibility and accuracy of FES depends on the estimation of amplitude and frequency of tremor signals measured by sensors. In this study, a novel algorithm incorporating a sliding fast Fourier transform (SFFT), an interpolation procedure and a limitation module of frequency range is developed to estimate tremor frequency and separate the tremor components from raw data. Based on the artificial signals and the actual tremor signals, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the developed algorithm could quickly adapt to the unknown dominant frequency and extract the tremor components with high accuracy. Therefore, this method could be employed in the tremor suppression by FES without affecting the voluntary movement."
icra,None,Efficacy of coordinating shoulder and elbow motion in a myoelectric transhumeral prosthesis in reaching tasks,"Nasser A. Alshammary,Daniel A Bennett,Michael Goldfarb,","This paper presents a control approach for myoelectric transhumeral prostheses that coordinates the movement of the elbow joint with the movement of the (intact) shoulder. The method combines input from a pair of surface electromyograms (EMG) inputs with information from an inertia measurement unit (IMU) to provide coordinated control of the joints, as described in the paper. In order to assess the efficacy of the control method, experiments were conducted on six healthy subjects using a virtual environment, comparing their ability to perform various pick-and-place tasks, specifically requiring that they pick a virtual ball from a given location and place it in a virtual box, which changed location randomly. The time required to complete a series of pick-and-place tasks using the coordinated control approach was compared to the time required to complete the tasks using a conventional sequential control approach. For these experiments, the average task completion time across all sessions and subjects was 12.8 s using the conventional sequential control approach, versus 8.7 s using the coordinated control approach (i.e., subjects performed the task 32% faster with the proposed approach), indicating that the proposed approach provides improved performance relative to the conventional approach."
icra,None,On the feasibility of wearable exotendon networks for whole-hand movement patterns in stroke patients,"Sangwoo Park,Lauri Bishop,Tara Post,Yuchen Xiao,Joel Stein,,","Fully wearable hand rehabilitation and assistive devices could extend training and improve quality of life for patients affected by hand impairments. However, such devices must deliver meaningful manipulation capabilities in a small and lightweight package. In this context, this paper investigates the capability of single-actuator devices to assist whole-hand movement patterns through a network of exotendons. Our prototypes combine a single linear actuator (mounted on a forearm splint) with a network of exotendons (routed on the surface of a soft glove). We investigated two possible tendon network configurations: one that produces full finger extension (overcoming flexor spasticity), and one that combines proximal flexion with distal extension at each finger. In experiments with stroke survivors, we measured the force levels needed to overcome various levels of spasticity and open the hand for grasping using the first of these configurations, and qualitatively demonstrated the ability to execute fingertip grasps using the second. Our results support the feasibility of developing future wearable devices able to assist a range of manipulation tasks."

Belda-Lois,,,,,,,","Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a disorder of posture and movement due to an imperfection or lesion in the immature brain. CP is often associated to sensory deficits, cognition impairments, communication and motor disabilities, behaviour issues, seizure disorder, pain and secondary musculoskeletal problems. New strategies are needed to help to promote, maintain, and rehabilitate the functional capacity, and thereby diminish the dedication and assistance required and the economical demands that this condition represents for the patient, the caregivers and the whole society. This paper describes the conceptualization and development of the integrated CPWalker robotic platform to support novel therapies for CP rehabilitation. This platform (Smart Walker + exoskeleton) is controlled by a multimodal interface to establish the interaction of CP children with robot-based therapies. The objective of these therapies is to improve the physical skills of children with CP and similar disorders. CPWalker concept will promote the earlier incorporation of CP patients to the rehabilitation therapy and increase the level of intensity and frequency of the exercises according to the task, which will enable the maintenance of therapeutic methods in daily basis, with the intention to lead to significant improvements in the treatment outcome."

Unlike the previously developed Exo-Glove, a fabric-based tendon-driven wearable robotic hand, Exo-Glove Poly was developed using silicone to allow for sanitization between users in multiple-user environments such as hospitals. Exo-Glove Poly was developed to use two motors, one for the thumb and the other for the index/middle finger, and an under-actuation mechanism to grasp various objects. In order to realize Exo-Glove Poly, design features and fabrication processes were developed to permit adjustment to different hand sizes, to protect users from injury, to enable ventilation, and to embed Teflon tubes for the wire paths. The mechanical properties of Exo-Glove Poly were verified with a healthy subject through a wrap grasp experiment using a mat-type pressure sensor and an under-actuation performance experiment with a specialized test set-up. Finally, performance of the Exo-Glove Poly for grasping various shapes of object was verified, including objects needing under-actuation."

The control system of MOPASS allows generation of individual gait patterns. The adjustment of the gait patterns to the patient is done over a graphical user interface by simple manipulation of the gait pattern curves displayed on the screen.

The finger posture control method where the vibration center angles of the active joint and the passive one are controlled independently of each other, is proposed. First we introduce the analytical model of two-joint two-link system which has the active joint driven by an actuator and the passive joint with a viscoelastic element. Based on the model, we theoretically reveal Variable Vibration Center Effect (VVCE) of the viscoelastic joint with respect to the input frequency of the active joint. We then discuss how to control the finger link posture by utilizing the effect. We show the finger mechanism design for grasping an object and for expanding the working space.

On the other hand, intentional introduction of a delay in a feedback control law may be beneficial in achieving good performance without relying on accurately tuned estimates for derivatives of measured signals. In this context, a proper design of retarded control laws represents an important challenge, and this paper gives a step forward to obtain better control laws for underactuated mechanical systems under the presence of time delays in measurements. Particularly, a Proportional-Retarded (PR) control law is designed for stabilization of an underactuated rotational inverted pendulum, known as the Furuta pendulum. Experiments over a laboratory platform as well as a comparison with a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) are performed to show the advantages of the proposed scheme."
icra,None,Step climbing cooperation primitives for legged robots with a reversible connection,"Carlos S. Casarez,Ronald S. Fearing,","Cooperation primitives for climbing steps were developed for a system of two 10 cm long VelociRoACH hexapedal legged robots with a removable connection. When performed sequentially, the set of primitives allow the team of two robots to climb a step on the order of their body length. These primitives use a tether between the robots actuated by a winch on one of the robots to form and release connections, run synchronously while connected, and provide a tether assist force while running. For a step with a coefficient of friction of 1 and a height of 6.5 cm, quasi-static analysis correctly predicts that the two connected robots can raise the front robot over the top of the step, while a single robot can only pitch upward against the step. The winch module designed to perform the cooperative climbing experiments meets the system goals of providing controllable forces greater than each robot's body weight while driving a removable connection between the robots. Experiments demonstrate that the robot system can perform each cooperation primitive individually with a reliability of at least 50% using simple strategies of maintaining a constant bounding frequency with the drive motors of each robot and a set tether tension with the winch."

Here, we present preliminary results demonstrating that low voltage (<;200 V) electroadhesives can be adapted onto a small off-the-shelf legged robot's feet for dynamic turning. It was shown that by changing the voltage, friction can be modulated to obtain different turning radii. A turning radius of 4 cm (half the robot's body width) was achieved by applying 120 V. However, it was also shown that the current electroadhesive designs are susceptible to scratches and wrinkles that reduce their performance after multiple runs."

Recent research has addressed significant challenges that exist in developing reliable, energy efficient, light weight micro actuation mechanisms, mostly focused on a single jump. However, there has been limited exploration of planning strategies to enable multi-hop navigation requiring turning and obstacle avoidance. This work introduces the concept of differential jump, generated by asymmetrical thrust from multiple thrusters, as a viable mode for navigation in micro-robots to enable turning during a jump. We present a simplified differential jump model, derive state propagation equations and adapt a sampling based motion planner to compute trajectories for such a system among obstacles in simulation. We further present an early prototype of a micro-robot (≈ 70mm cube) capable of navigation on a planar surface among obstacles using the differential jump mechanism presented."

This paper proposes the concept of virtual connecting manipulation as a generalized motion planning framework for nongrasping manipulation systems. As a preliminary result, we had previously realized a flower-stick juggling task called “propeller motion” using an actual experimental system. In this paper, we apply the virtual connecting manipulation concept to a flower-stick juggling task and analyze the generated motion from the view point of analytical methodology. We conduct a stability analysis of the generated cyclic motion of the flower stick by using a Poincaré map, and the analytical results show that the generated cyclic motion is asymptotically stable."

This system is suitable for situations such as disaster areas in which it is difficult to set up a conveyor line manually. We analyze the reachability of a group of mobile conveyor belts and propose an algorithm to check the reachability of a given destination, as well as a method to generate a configuration to guide conveyor belts to connect themselves to reach the destination. Our experimental results show that our algorithms, together with a heuristic that biases the search towards the destination, can quickly generate configurations of conveyor belts for problems that require less than 20 conveyor belts."

Development of an automated diagnosis methodology is necessary for the maintenance of superannuated social infrastructures. The hammering test, which is an efficient inspection method, has attracted considerable attention in the context of automated inspection using robots. In this study, to apply the hammering test to robotic inspection, in which material conditions of infrastructures must be diagnosed in detail, an estimation method of the defect conditions is proposed, and an integration technique of plural classifiers for improving the inspection accuracy is introduced. Furthermore, an inspection system that can decrease the influence of the mechanical running-noise is implemented. Our experimental results using concrete test pieces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method; the accuracy of the defect detection and defect condition estimation was validated."

The use case revolves around grasping and manipulation of deformable objects. These kinds of tasks are difficult to tune to a satisfactory extent by expert users, and therefore optimization by simulation is a good alternative to achieve satisfactory solutions. In order to apply the optimization, a dynamic simulation framework has been used to model the performance of a given solution for the task. The solutions are parameterized in terms of the robot motion and the gripper configuration, and after each simulation various objective scores are determined and combined. This enables the use of various optimization strategies. Based on visual inspection of the most robust solution found, it is determined that 50 out of 50 simulations, with different meat properties, produce satisfactory manipulations."
icra,None,3D printing of variable stiffness hyper-redundant robotic arm,"Yang Yang,Yonghua Chen,Yingtian Li,Michael Zhiqiang Chen,","Shape memory polymer (SMP) is a type of functional materials that changes Young's modulus when heated above glass transition temperature (Tg). In this work, this property of SMP has been explored for the design and fabrication of a modular omni-directional joint with variable stiffness. When cascading a number of such joints, a variable stiffness hyper-redundant robotic arm can be built. The basic design of the variable stiffness joint is based on a ball joint where the ball is made of two materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and SMP, and the socket is made of only ABS material. When heated, the ball joint shows different resistive torques below and above the SMP's glass transition temperature Tg. Moreover, shape recovery property of SMP material above Tg guarantees the design with high repeatability. Both the ball and the socket are made by a 3D printing process fused deposition modeling (FDM). The FDM fabrication of SMP is made possible by a novel process control method in the FDM process. The ball joint's variable stiffness is tested by a number of experiments. Experimental results indicate distinct changes in resistive torques at different test temperatures. Using the proposed modular omni-directional ball joints, a variable stiffness hyper-redundant robotic arm is built."

This new printing capability enables complex hydraulically actuated robots and robotic components to be automatically built, with no assembly required. The technique is showcased by printing linear bellows actuators, gear pumps, soft grippers and a hexapod robot, using a commercially-available 3D printer. We detail the steps required to modify the printer and describe the design constraints imposed by this new fabrication approach."
icra,None,High-performance robotic contour tracking based on the dynamic compensation concept,"Shouren Huang,Niklas Bergström,Yuji Yamakawa,Taku Senoo,,","This paper focuses on high-performance robotic contour tracking under the uncertainties that commonly exist in actual robotic applications. These uncertainties can be attributed to the robot itself (such as modeling errors or mechanical defects like backlash) or to environmental issues (such as calibration errors or misalignment of the workpiece). We propose a non-model-based dynamic compensation approach based on the coarse-to-fine philosophy, which enables contour tracking with both high speed and good accuracy. This is achieved by adopting a methodology in which a main robot performs fast but coarse motion, while an add-on module conducts accurate compensation for the overall uncertainties using a high-speed camera and high-speed compensation actuator. An algorithm called pre-compensated proportionalderivative sliding mode control (pre-compensated PD-SMC) is proposed to control the compensation actuator. The effectiveness of the proposed contour tracking approach and control algorithm are experimentally verified using two typical planar-contour shapes: a random smooth-curvature and rectangle."

This is important to match the corners of the parts as well as to compensate for uncertain material characteristics and variations in the length of the parts. In this method, the feed speed for the two parts is controlled independently, based on measurements of the endpoints of the parts while keeping an equal sewing force in both parts. Different strategies for correcting errors are presented and experiments are shown to evaluate the different strategies. Possibilities for using the methods to match reference points during the sewing are discussed."
icra,None,High accurate robotic drilling with external sensor and compliance model-based compensation,"J. R. Diaz Posada,U. Schneider,S. Pidan,M. Geravand,P. Stelzer,,","High accurate absolute robot positioning is a requirement, and still a challenge, in many applications, such as drilling in the aerospace industry. The accuracy is affected due to many sources of errors from robot model, tool calibration, sensor and product uncertainties. While model-based error compensation cannot reach the desired accuracy, sensor-based compensation appears as the practical solution to increase the robot positioning accuracy. A structured analysis of the error sources in robotic manufacturing processes can facilitate error identification and further compensation. This paper describes an error source breaking down approach for analyzing robotic manufacturing processes. Moreover, an external sensor-based compensation is proposed for error reduction and error identification. Comparison with a compliance model-based compensation is performed. The proposed approach is applied to a robotic drilling process for aircraft manufacturing, considered a general and real industrial application. Further validation through experimentation is performed. The validation revealed a clear improvement in robot positioning accuracy and the benefits of the proposed error source structure for analysis."
icra,None,Towards manipulation planning for multiple interlinked deformable linear objects,"Ankit J. Shah,Julie A. Shah,","Manipulation of deformable linear objects (DLO) has potential applications in aerospace and automotive assembly. The current literature on planning for deformable objects focuses on a single DLO at a time. In this paper, we provide a problem formulation for attaching a set of interlinked DLOs to a support structure through a set of clamping points. We also present a prototype algorithm that generates a solution in terms of primitive manipulation actions. The algorithm guarantees that none of the interlink constraints are violated. Finally, we incorporate gravity in the computation of a DLO shape and propose a property linking geometrically similar cable shapes across the space of cable length and stiffness. This property allows for computation of solutions for unit length and scaling of the solutions to appropriate length, thus potentially making shape computations faster."
icra,None,Efficiently solving general rearrangement tasks: A fast extension primitive for an incremental sampling-based planner,"Athanasios Krontiris,Kostas E. Bekris,","Manipulating multiple movable obstacles is a hard problem that involves searching high-dimensional C-spaces. A milestone method for this problem was able to compute solutions for monotone instances. These are problems where every object needs to be transferred at most once to achieve a desired arrangement. The method uses backtracking search to find the order with which objects should be moved. This paper first proposes an approximate but significantly faster alternative for monotone rearrangement instances. The method defines a dependency graph between objects given minimum constraint removal paths (MCR) to transfer each object to its target. From this graph, the approach discovers the order of moving objects by performing topological sorting without backtracking search. The approximation arises from the limitation to consider only MCR paths, which minimize, however, the number of conflicts between objects. To solve non-monotone instances, this primitive is incorporated in a higher-level incremental search algorithm for general rearrangement planning, which operates similar to Bi-RRT. Given a start and a goal object arrangement, tree structures of reachable new arrangements are generated by using the primitive as an expansion procedure. The integrated solution achieves probabilistic completeness for the general non-monotone case and based on simulated experiments it achieves very good success ratios, solution times and path quality relative to alternatives."
icra,None,A coordinate-free framework for robotic pizza tossing and catching,"Aykut C. Satici,Fabio Ruggiero,Vincenzo Lippiello,Bruno Siciliano,","In this work, we demonstrate how autonomous pizza tossing and catching can be achieved. Under the assumption that the pizza dough is grasped by a number of fingers with soft contact, we formulate the grasp constraints and use them to derive the individual and combined Euler-Lagrange dynamic equations of motion of the robotic manipulator and the dough. In particular, the dynamics of the dough is a modified version of the rigid-body dynamics, taking into account the change of inertia due to its deformation. Armed with these mathematical models, we tackle the two control problems of tossing and catching. For the tossing phase, we derive an exponentially convergent controller that stabilizes a desired velocity of the dough as it is let go. On the other hand, so as to catch the dough, we generate an optimal trajectory for the end-effector of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we derive control laws to make the optimal trajectory exponentially attractive. We demonstrate the developed theory with an elaborate simulation of the tossing and catching phases."
icra,None,Rearrangement planning using object-centric and robot-centric action spaces,"Jennifer E. King,Marco Cognetti,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,","This paper addresses the problem of rearrangement planning, i.e. to find a feasible trajectory for a robot that must interact with multiple objects in order to achieve a goal. We propose a planner to solve the rearrangement planning problem by considering two different types of actions: robot-centric and object-centric. Object-centric actions guide the planner to perform specific actions on specific objects. Robot-centric actions move the robot without object relevant intent, easily allowing simultaneous object contact and whole arm interaction. We formulate a hybrid planner that uses both action types. We evaluate the planner on tasks for a mobile robot and a household manipulator."
icra,None,Considering avoidance and consistency in motion planning for human-robot manipulation in a shared workspace,"Rafi Hayne,Ruikun Luo,Dmitry Berenson,","This paper presents an approach to formulating the cost function for a motion planner intended for human-robot collaboration on manipulation tasks in a shared workspace. To be effective for human-robot collaboration a robot should plan its motion so that it is both safe and efficient. To achieve this, we propose two factors to consider in the cost function for the robot's motion planner: (1) Avoidance of the workspace previously-occupied by the human, so that the motion is as safe as possible, and (2) Consistency of the robot's motion, so that the motion is as predictable as possible for the human and they can perform their task without focusing undue attention on the robot. Our experiments in simulation and a human-robot workspace sharing study compare a cost function that uses only the first factor and a combined cost that uses both factors vs. a baseline method that is perfectly consistent but does not account for the human's previous motion. We find that using either cost function we outperform the baseline method in terms of task success rate without degrading the task completion time. The best task success rate is achieved with the cost function that includes both the avoidance and consistency terms."
icra,None,Planning and execution of groping behavior for contact sensor based manipulation in an unknown environment,"Masaki Murooka,Ryohei Ueda,Shunichi Nozawa,Yohei Kakiuchi,,,","Groping behavior based on contact sensors is necessary for manipulation in an unknown environment. For those situations, it is effective for a robot to accumulate contact information as an environment map, and to plan the motions for executing the safe trial motion. We first propose a method of updating the occupancy grid map of the manipulation region from the contact information by introducing the contact sensor model. Using this map, we propose a method of sampling-based motion planning that enables the execution of the safe trial motion based on the criteria of feasibility and safety. To verify the effectiveness, we show the experimentally obtained results, showing that a real robot plans and executes the manipulation with groping behavior in the occluded environment."
icra,None,Planning for grasp selection of partially occluded objects,"Sung-Kyun Kim,Maxim Likhachev,","In a cluttered scene, an object is often occluded by other objects, and a robot cannot figure out what the object is and perceive its pose exactly. We assume that the robot is equipped with a depth sensor and given a database of 3D object models and their grasping poses, but yet there is uncertainty about object's class and pose. In this paper, we study the problem of how to predict the class and pose of an occluded object by carefully taking a sequence of observations. To find the best sequence of viewpoints by the robot, we construct hypotheses of the states of the target and occluding objects, and update our belief state as new observations come in. Every time selecting the next robot pose, we greedily choose the one that is expected to reduce the uncertainty the most. Based on the theoretical analysis of adaptive submodular maximization problems, this process is guaranteed to find a near-optimal sequence of robot poses in terms of observation and traverse costs. To validate the proposed method, we present simulation and robot experiments using a PR2."
icra,None,Affordance-feasible planning with manipulator wrench spaces,"Andrew Price,Stephen Balakirsky,Aaron Bobick,Henrik Christensen,","This work introduces an affordance characterization employing mechanical wrenches as a metric for predicting and planning with workspace affordances. Although affordances are a commonly used high-level paradigm for robotic task-level planning and learning, the literature has been sparse regarding how to characterize the agent in this object-agent-environment framework. In this work, we propose decomposing a behavior into a vocabulary of characteristic requirements and capabilities that are suitable to predict the affordances of various parts of the workspace. Specifically, we investigate mechanical wrenches as a viable representation of these affordance requirements and capabilities. We then use this vocabulary in a planning system to compose complex motions from simple behavior types in continuous space. The utility of the framework for complex planning is demonstrated on example scenarios both in simulation and with real-world industrial manipulators."
icra,None,Folding assembly by means of dual-arm robotic manipulation,"Diogo Almeida,Yiannis Karayiannidis,","In this paper, we consider folding assembly as an assembly primitive suitable for dual-arm robotic assembly, that can be integrated in a higher level assembly strategy. The system composed by two pieces in contact is modelled as an articulated object, connected by a prismatic-revolute joint. Different grasping scenarios were considered in order to model the system, and a simple controller based on feedback linearisation is proposed, using force torque measurements to compute the contact point kinematics. The folding assembly controller has been experimentally tested with two sample parts, in order to showcase folding assembly as a viable assembly primitive."
icra,None,Optical manipulation of multiple microscopic objects with Brownian perturbations,"Quang Minh Ta,Chien Chern Cheah,","In existing control techniques for optical manipulation, the effect of the Brownian motion is usually disregarded for ease of analyzing the control systems. However, due to the prevalence of the Brownian motion and its effect on micro-manipulation of tiny objects, it is important for the Brownian effect to be properly taken into account so as to ensure the performance and stability of the control systems. This paper proposes a robotic control technique to achieve automated manipulation of multiple microscopic objects with the consideration of the Brownian perturbations. In this control technique, a desired dynamic region is first initiated to enclose all the trapped micro-objects. The trapped objects are then manipulated as a whole while being kept inside the desired region, and at the same time, avoiding collisions between each other during the course of manipulation. Rigorous mathematical formulation is developed to analyze the control system for automated manipulation of multiple micro-objects with stochastic perturbations. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control technique."
icra,None,Curvature control of soft orthotics via low cost solid-state optics,"Huichan Zhao,Rukang Huang,Robert F. Shepherd,","A soft orthotic with position control enabled via embedded optical fiber is presented. The design, manufacture, and integration of both the pneumatically powered actuators and optical sensors are described. This orthotic actuator-sensor pair is self-contained and worn on a human finger. When un-powered, the elastomeric actuator allows facile movement and, when pneumatically actuated, the orthotic causes bending of the wearer's finger. Position control is achieved by measurement of signal intensity from a light-emitting diode (LED) input traveling through an embedded optical fiber—greater curvature results in increased light intensity. Both the static and dynamic states are monitored via the optical sensor and the prescribed curvatures are achieved accurately and with stability by a gain-scheduled proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller implemented by applying pulse-width-modulation (PWM) signals to a solenoid valve to adjust the internal pressure of the actuator."

Majeika,Phillip Schaffer,Matthew Bowers,,,,,,,","Hydro Muscles are linear actuators resembling ordinary biological muscles in terms of active dynamic output, passive material properties and appearance. The passive and dynamic characteristics of the latex based Hydro Muscle are addressed. The control tests of modular muscles are presented together with a muscle model relating sensed quantities with net force. Hydro Muscles are discussed in the context of conventional actuators. The hypothesis that Hydro Muscles have greater efficiency than McKibben Muscles is experimentally verified. Hydro Muscle peak efficiency with (without) back flow consideration was 88% (27%). Possible uses of Hydro Muscles are illustrated by relevant robotics projects at WPI. It is proposed that Hydro Muscles can also be an excellent educational tool for moderate-budget robotics classrooms and labs; the muscles are inexpensive (in the order of standard latex tubes of comparable size), made of off-the-shelf elements in less than 10 minutes, easily customizable, lightweight, biologically inspired, efficient, compliant soft linear actuators that are adept for power-augmentation. Moreover, a single source can actuate many muscles by utilizing control of flow and/or pressure. Still further, these muscles can utilize ordinary tap water and successfully operate within a safe range of pressures not overly exceeding standard water household pressure of about 0.59 MPa (85 psi)."
icra,None,Design and implementation of a 300% strain soft artificial muscle,"Elliot W. Hawkes,David L. Christensen,Allison M. Okamura,","We present the inverse pneumatic artificial muscle (IPAM), a new soft actuator that is powered by pneumatics in a manner inverse to traditional pneumatic muscles: low pressure, rather than high, contracts the muscle. The IPAM improves on the 50-year-old standard in soft pneumatic actuators, the McKibben muscle, but retains many of the advantages that have drawn roboticists to this artificial muscle over the years. The McKibben muscle produces up to 40% strain, and has nonlinear control with friction and hysteresis, whereas the IPAM attains strains of over 300% and has a nearly linear mapping between input pressure and force/length output and no sliding friction. Crucially, the IPAM retains the soft structure, low weight, compliance, and robustness that the McKibben muscle boasts. We present a simple model to describe the behavior of the muscle, as well as force, displacement, pressure, and speed tests validating the model and characterizing the IPAM's performance. Further, we present two practical implementations using the IPAM: an active brace and a robotic finger."
icra,None,Comparison of kinesthetic and skin deformation feedback for mass rendering,"Jacob M. Suchoski,Aaron Barron,Connie Wu,Zhan Fan Quek,Sean Keller,,","Virtual and augmented reality systems that immerse users in a 3D environment could benefit from haptic (force and/or tactile) feedback to increase realism and task performance. A canonical task that cannot be achieved compellingly without haptic feedback is the grasp and lift of an object with mass. Traditional kinesthetic (force) feedback devices provide realistic physical interactions with virtual objects, but typically require large actuators, making them bulky and encumbering. In contrast, tactile feedback devices can use smaller actuators and may enable freer movement of a user in a virtual world. One form of tactile feedback, skin deformation feedback, has been previously shown to provide effective haptic feedback of force, stiffness, and friction. Here we compare human perception of mass via kinesthetic feedback and skin deformation feedback in a virtual environment. Participants grasp and lift two virtual blocks and attempt to equalize their masses by the method of adjustments. From the accuracy of this equalization, we determined that the Weber Fraction (the just noticeable difference in proportion to the original stimulus value) of virtual mass during a grasp and lift task was 0.11 for kinesthetic force feedback and 0.35 for skin deformation feedback. In addition, participants exhibited differences in exploratory procedures between the two types of feedback."

The mechanical properties of the human soft tissue, are important to characterize the tissue deformation of each patient. The (recovered) elasticity parameters can assist surgeons to perform better pre-op surgical planning and enable medical robots to carry out personalized surgical procedures. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm on mechanical-property estimation from a temporal sequence of deformation samples. It does not require an external force-application measurement device or landmark-based displacement tracking. We test our approach on the reconstruction the Young's modulus of a human heart and further validate the results derived from videos using known parameters of tennis and foam balls."

We proposed the Torque-Angle Relationship Control System (TARCS) for musculoskeletal robots with changeable output properties. First, we formulated TARCS and examined its static properties. Next, we used TARCS to change the properties and investigated the effect of the same on the jumping ability through simulations. We found that TARCS in a biarticular muscle determined the general shape of the jumpable range. Furthermore, TARCS in a monoarticular muscle could change the amplitude of the jumpable range. Both TARCS also changed the directional property of the reaction to the disturbance. Finally, we developed a musculoskeletal quadruped robot in which TARCS was implemented. This robot could change its jumping direction using TARCS, and it jumped to a height of 0.254 m at the lowest point of its body."

By optimizing the 9 hysteresis model parameters with a genetic algorithm, the proposed model is shown to be capable of representing quasi-static response of two different diameter cables, 0.61 mm (thin) and 1.19 mm (thick), used for the RAVEN II surgical robotic surgery platform. The construction of the cable is 7 strands with 19 individual wires per strand. Furthermore, it is shown that the dynamic response of the cables are captured by adding a linear damping term. The hysteresis model and linear damper with the optimized parameters accurately models a longitudinal vibration test result in terms of frequency, steady state stretch, and logarithmic decrement. Energy dissipation due solely to the hysteresis term is approximately calculated to be 57 and 71% of the total energy loss for the thin and thick cables respectively. The proposed model may be used for cables with different contraction and diameter and can be applied for control of cable driven robots in which cables are stretched longitudinally without large excitation of other modes."

However, for most endobronchial devices, the lack of a bendable tip restricts their access ability to get into distal bronchi with complex bifurcations. This paper presents the design of a new wire-driven continuum manipulator to help guide these devices. The proposed manipulator is built by assembling miniaturized blocks that are featured with interlocking circular joints. It has the capability of maintaining its integrity when the lengths of actuation wires change due to the shaft flex. It allows the existence of a relatively large central cavity to pass through other instruments and enables two rotational degrees of freedom. All these features make it suitable for procedures where tubular anatomies are involved and the flexible shafts have to be considerably bent in usage, just like bronchoscopic interventions. A kinematic model is built to estimate the relationship between the translations of actuation wires and the manipulator tip position. A scale-up model is produced for evaluation experiments and the results validate the performance of the proposed mechanism."

This planner is employed to enable a continuum-style manipulator to move autonomously in dynamic environments in real-time. The classic potential field method is modified to make it applicable for a kinematics model based on the constant-curvature assumption. The contribution of this paper lies in the design of a novel potential field in the actuator space satisfying the mechanical constraints of the manipulator. The planning algorithm is tested and validated in real-time simulation for a 3 segments continuum manipulator. Preliminary tests for a tendon-driven single-segment continuum manipulator prototype confirm the performance of the proposed planner."

Future robots require high power-to-weight ratios as well as inherent long operational lifetimes without breakage in order to achieve similar perfection. Robustness due to passive compliance and high-speed catapult-like motions as possible with fast energy release are further beneficial characteristics. Such properties can be realized with antagonistic muscle-based designs. Additionally, control algorithms need to exploit the full potential of the robot. Learning control is a promising direction due to its the potential to capture uncertainty and control of complex systems. The aim of this paper is to build a robotic arm that is capable of generating high accelerations and sophisticated trajectories as well as enable exploration at such speeds for robot learning approaches. Hence, we have designed a light-weight robot arm with moving masses below 700 g with powerful antagonistic compliant actuation with pneumatic artificial muscles. Rather than recreating human anatomy, our system is designed to be easy to control in order to facilitate future learning of fast trajectory tracking control. The resulting robot is precise at low speeds using a simple PID controller while reaching high velocities of up to 12 m/s in task space and 1500 deg/s in joint space. This arm will enable new applications in fast changing and uncertain task like robot table tennis while being a sophisticated and reproducible test-bed for robot skill learning methods.

The approach was implemented using a six degree-of-freedom rigid-link manipulator as input device for teleoperation of a three section, nine degree-of-freedom continuum robot. Tests were conducted across a range of planar and spatial tasks, using fifteen participant operators. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, and suggest that it can be effective independent of the prior robotics, gaming, or teleoperative experience of the operator."

A Novint Falcon device is used to simulate the motion of the coronary bypass site. The 3D position of the heart simulator is measured optically in real time using an NDI Optotrak Certus tracker. The NDI measurements are used to command the da Vinci patient side manipulators to track, from a fixed distance, the simulated heart surface. Visual stabilization is achieved by having a stereo endoscopic camera carried by another patient-side manipulator that is also tracking the heart surface. The system performance is evaluated and discussed. In a preliminary evaluation study, surgeons were asked to perform a bimanual teleoperation suturing task on the simulated heart, with the gold standard being a suturing task on a stationary surface. When motion compensation was enabled, the median completion time dropped from 1.24 to 1.07 of the gold standard, the number of errors was reduced, and subjective measures show higher preference for the use of motion compensation in the da Vinci controllers."

In the literature, this knowledge is acquired thanks to an installation / registration procedure, prior to the operation. In this paper, we are considering a comanipulation scenario: Both the robot and the surgeon hold the instrument. All along a procedure, the instrument can be inserted into or removed from different trocars by the surgeon. It is needed to detect in real time whether the instrument is inserted in a trocar and to compute the fulcrum coordinates.

To compute the instrument's position from a single 2D image, we develop an innovative gradient descent algorithm which rotates and translates a line segment (over the plane spanned by the imaged instrument and the optical centre) until it best aligns with the manipulated tool. In contrast with other approaches in the literature, our algorithm only requires to simultaneously observe two feature points; the proposed iterative algorithm is not based on the exact solution, therefore it can still work with noisy image measurements.

Instead of introducing costly grasping mechanisms, the proposed system consists of a pair of rods driven by two robotic forceps holders, so that they can synchronously grasp, move, and rotate objects, in manner of a chopstick. Five-DOF kinematic model is constructed, which includes three-DOF translational motion, a sliding motion, and a grasping motion.

A bounding filter is used to compensate for model inaccuracy and to improve method robustness. The proposed method was validated on a 10mm gripper which is driven by a Raven-II surgical robot. The gripper was equipped with 1-dimensional force sensors which served as ground truth data.

In these manipulators, encoders are usually mounted on the motor, and joint angles are estimated based on transmission kinematics. However, due to non-linear properties of cables such as cable stretch, lower stiffness, and uncertainties in kinematic model parameters, the precision of joint angle estimation is limited with transmission kinematics approach. To improve the positioning of these manipulators, we use a pair of low cost stereo camera as the observation for joint angles and we input these noisy measurements into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for state estimation. We use the dual UKF to estimate cable parameters and states offline. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method on a Raven-II experimental surgical research platform. Additional encoders at the joint output were employed as a reference system. From the experiments, the UKF improved the accuracy of joint angle estimation by 33- 72%. Also, we tested the reliability of state estimation under camera occlusion. We found that when the system dynamics is tuned with offline UKF parameter estimation, the camera occlusion has no effect on the online state estimation."

We present Transition State Clustering with Deep Learning (TSC-DL), a new unsupervised algorithm that leverages video and kinematic data for task-level segmentation, and finds regions of the visual feature space that correlate with transition events using features constructed from layers of pre-trained image classification Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We report results on three datasets comparing Deep Learning architectures (AlexNet and VGG), choice of convolutional layer, dimensionality reduction techniques, visual encoding, and the use of Scale Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT). We find that the deep architectures extract features that result in up-to a 30.4% improvement in Silhouette Score (a measure of cluster tightness) over the traditional “shallow” features from SIFT.

We developed an approach based on unsupervised alignment to efficient annotate kinematic data for its constituent activity segments. Our method includes extracting non-linear features from the kinematic data using a stacked de-noising autoencoder, and using modified dynamic time warping to align the kinematic data from different trials of the study task. We combined alignment between a test and one or a small set of template trials (with prior manual annotations) with voting based on kernel density estimation to transfer labels from the template to the test trial. Our experiments on performance of this method using two datasets captured in the training laboratory demonstrate an accuracy of 72% to 94% for annotating activity segments within a surgical training task. Our findings are robust to data captured from several surgeons, and to deviations in activity from a canonical activity sequence."

Taylor,,","Surgeons often manually palpate tissue or organs in order to find tumors or other anatomical structures. Information about organ geometry and tissue stiffness gained from palpation can also be extremely useful in robotic surgery for diagnosis, surgical guidance, and registration to other preoperative information. However, it is not always easy to obtain, even if the robot is equipped with force sensors. This paper reports our approach for concurrent estimation of stiffness and surface geometry, using a continuous motion similar to a sweeping palpation motion used by surgeons. Our method relies on force data captured by a tactile sensor rigidly attached to an end-effector probe. We use Gaussian processes to simultaneously estimate geometry and stiffness. The method is not tied to any specific robotic platform and is consistent with a variety of palpation strategies. For simplicity, we discuss the results based on two different palpation primitives. This is our first step towards developing an adaptive high fidelity model reconstruction and path optimization technique."

Patients with Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) who have undergone surgical treatments suffer scarring within the heart that can lead to abnormal cardiac rhythms. However, poor intraoperative cardiac geometry recovery and incomplete Electrophysiological (EP) mapping due to limited available procedure time and complex anatomy have resulted in difficulty to detect the regions to ablate and hence relatively high recurrence rates. In this paper, we present a catheter path planning algorithm to optimise cardiac EP mapping. Firstly, the optimal mapping positions are determined by curvature and distance weighted Quadric Error Metric Simplification (QEMS) to maximally recover the cardiac chamber geometry and EP mapping. Secondly, an efficient path is designed that moves along a predetermined axis for a robotic catheter to pass through and collect EP data at these positions. Validation is performed on retrospectively collected CARTO data from ACHD patients."

More precisely, the developed control law is to servo an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system in real-time to carry out repetitive optical biopsy tasks. The OCT images are simultaneously used to perform the optical biopsy and to control the sample holder (microrobotic work-flow). Instead of extracting visual features from the OCT images, the vision-based controller uses the concept of frequency domain information to compute relative motion between two successive OCT B-scan (cross-section) images. Therefore, the visual controller is designed to minimize the error between current and desired images by controlling the microrobotic platform. The proposed approach was experimentally validated, demonstrating more than satisfactory results especially in terms of accuracy, convergence, and robustness."

Conner,,","In this work, we take a step towards bridging the gap between the theory of formal synthesis and its application to real-world, complex, robotic systems. In particular, we present an end-to-end approach for the automatic generation of code that implements high-level robot behaviors in a verifiably correct manner, including reaction to the possible failures of low-level actions. We start with a description of the system defined a priori. Thus, a non-expert user need only specify a high-level task. We automatically construct a formal specification, in a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), that encodes the system's capabilities and constraints, the task, and the desired reaction to low-level failures. We then synthesize a reactive mission plan that is guaranteed to satisfy the formal specification, i.e., achieve the task's goals or correctly react to failures. Lastly, we automatically generate a state machine that instantiates the synthesized symbolic plan in software. We showcase our approach using Team ViGIR's software and Atlas humanoid robot and present lab experiments, thus demonstrating the application of formal synthesis techniques to complex robotic systems. The proposed approach has been implemented and open-sourced as a collection of Robot Operating System (ROS) packages, which are adaptable to other systems."

In the considered scenario, the robot is standing in a workspace, when a moving obstacle (e.g., a human, or another robot) enters its safety area and heads towards it; the humanoid must plan and execute in real-time a maneuver that avoids the collision. The proposed method goes through several conceptual steps. Once the entrance of the moving obstacle in the safety area is detected, its approach direction relative to the robot is determined. On the basis of this information, a suitable evasion maneuver represented by footsteps is generated. From these, an appropriate trajectory is computed for the Center of Mass of the humanoid. Finally, joint motion commands are generated so as to track such trajectory. All computations make use of closed-form expressions and are therefore suitable for real-time implementation. The proposed approach is validated via simulations and experiments on a NAO humanoid. The possibility of adapting the basic method so as to be used in a replanning framework is also investigated."

Gammell,Timothy D. Barfoot,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,,","Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT*, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions. In this paper, we present a hybrid technique that integrates the benefits of both methods into a single search. A key insight is that applying local optimization to a subset of edges likely to improve the solution avoids the prohibitive cost of optimizing every edge in a global search. This is made possible by Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed global technique that orders its search by potential solution quality. In our algorithm, Regionally Accelerated BIT* (RABIT*), we extend BIT* by using optimization to exploit local domain information and find alternative connections for edges in collision and accelerate the search. This improves search performance in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes (e.g., narrow passages) while maintaining almost-sure asymptotic convergence to the global optimum. Our experiments on simulated random worlds and real data from an autonomous helicopter show that on certain difficult problems, RABIT* converges 1.8 times faster than BIT*. Qualitatively, in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, we show that RABIT* is able to efficiently transform paths to avoid obstacles."

Gaussian processes constitute an interesting underlying data model that leverages the spatial correlations of the process to be explored to reduce the required sampling of data. Furthermore, multi-agent approaches offer well known advantages for exploration. Previous decentralized multi-agent exploration algorithms that use Gaussian processes as underlying data model, have only been validated through simulations. However, the implementation of an exploration algorithm brings difficulties that were not tackle yet. In this work, we propose an exploration algorithm that deals with the following challenges: (i) which information to transmit to achieve multi-agent coordination; (ii) how to implement a light-weight collision avoidance; (iii) how to learn the data's model without prior information. We validate our algorithm with two experiments employing real robots. First, we explore the magnetic field intensity with a ground-based robot. Second, two quadcopters equipped with an ultrasound sensor explore a terrain profile. We show that our algorithm outperforms a meander and a random trajectory, as well as we are able to learn the data's model online while exploring."

In this paper, we utilise a multimodal learning approach to capture the relationship between in-situ visual observations, and shipborne bathymetry (ocean depth) data that are freely available a priori. We then derive information-theoretic measures under this model that predict the amount of visual information gain at an unobserved location based on the bathymetric features. Unlike previous approaches, these measures consider the value of additional visual features, rather than just the habitat labels obtained. Experimental results with a toy dataset and real marine data demonstrate that the approach can be used to predict the true utility of unexplored areas."

In its most general form, it can be modeled as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem. However POMDPs are generally difficult to solve when the underlying spaces are continuous, particularly when beliefs are non-Gaussian, and the difficulty is further exacerbated when there are also non-convex constraints on states. Existing algorithms to address such challenging POMDPs are expensive in terms of computation and memory. In this paper, we provide a feedback policy in non-Gaussian belief space by solving a convex program for common non-linear observation models. The solution involves a Receding Horizon Control strategy using particle filters for the non-Gaussian belief representation. We develop a way of capturing non-convex constraints in the state space and adapt the optimization to incorporate such constraints, as well. A key advantage of this method is that it does not introduce additional variables in the optimization problem and is therefore more scalable than existing constrained problems in belief space. We demonstrate the performance of the method on different scenarios."

Many different approaches have been developed to create smooth trajectories for robot movement. For example there are optimization algorithms, which optimize kinematic or dynamic properties of a trajectory. Furthermore, nonlinear programming methods like e.g. optimal control, or polynomial based methods are widely used for trajectory generation. Most of these techniques are used to calculate a trajectory in advance, or they are limited to create point-to-point motions, where the robot needs to stop when switching to the next target point, especially, when interpolating in rotational space. In this paper, we combine a low-pass filter and spherical linear interpolation to realize a velocity-limited online trajectory generator for robot orientations in quaternion space. We use the developed motion generator for mirroring a human arm motion with a robot, recorded by a low frequency visual tracking. Using the proposed method, we can replicate the motion of the operator's arm with very little delay and thereby achieve an easy-to-use interface. Furthermore, as we can strictly limit the velocity of the generated motion, the approach can safely be used in human robot collaboration applications."

The input for our algorithm is an environment and a collection of sensor directions, in which each is capable of line-of-sight detection in a fixed direction. The output is a pursuer motion strategy that ensures the detection of an evader that moves with unbounded speed, or a statement that no such strategy exists. The intuition of the algorithmis to decompose the environment into a collection of convex conservative regions, within which the evader cannot sneak between any pair of adjacent sensors. This decomposition induces a graph we call the pursuit-evasion graph (PEG), such that any correct solution strategy can be expressed as a path through the PEG. For an instance defined by m beams and an environment with n vertices, the algorithm runs in time O(2mn2). We implemented the algorithm in simulation and present some computed examples illustrating the algorithm's correctness."

In this paper, we define a super ray for points as a representative ray to them with an associated frustum. A super ray is constructed in a way that updating those points has the same set of cells accessed during the map update process. As a result, we can perform the update process with a super ray in a single traversal on the map, resulting in performance improvement without compromising any representation accuracy of the map. For constructing super rays efficiently, we propose mapping lines for handling 2-D and 3-D cases from an observation that edges or grid points branch out the access pattern of updating the map. Our method is general enough to be applied for variety of occupancy map structures based on axis-aligned space subdivisions such as grids and octrees. We test our method into indoor and outdoor benchmarks, and achieve 2.5 times on average (up to 3.5 times) performance improvement over the state-of-the-art update method for OctoMap and grid maps."

A promising solution for a range of real-world applications are gas-sensitive mobile robots with spectroscopy-based remote sensors that are used to create a tomographic reconstruction of the gas distribution. The quality of these reconstructions depends crucially on the chosen sensing geometry. In this paper we address the problem of sensor planning by investigating sensing geometries that minimize reconstruction errors, and then formulate an optimization algorithm that chooses sensing configurations accordingly. The algorithm decouples sensor planning for single high concentration regions (hotspots) and subsequently fuses the individual solutions to a global solution consisting of sensing poses and the shortest path between them. The proposed algorithm compares favorably to a template matching technique in a simple simulation and in a real-world experiment. In the latter, we also compare the proposed sensor planning strategy to the sensing strategy of a human expert and find indications that the quality of the reconstructed map is higher with the proposed algorithm."

An integrated control scheme for the fingers and for the arm enables quick control of the position and posture of the arm by placing the fingertips adjacent to the surface of an object to be grasped. The arm control scheme enables adjustments based on errors in hand position and posture that would be impossible to achieve by finger motions alone, thus allowing the fingers to grasp an object in a laterally symmetric grasp. This can prevent grasp failures such as a finger pushing the object out of the hand or knocking the object over. Proposed control of the arm and hand allowed correction of position errors on the order of several centimeters. For example, an object on a workbench that is in an uncertain positional relation with the robot, with an inexpensive optical sensor such as a Kinect, which only provides coarse image data, would be sufficient for grasping an object."

In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach for agile aerial vehicles that allows for measurement validation and seamless switching between sensors based on statistical signal quality analysis. Moreover, it is capable of self-initialization of its extrinsic sensor states. These initialized states are maintained in the framework such that the system can continuously self-calibrate. We implement this framework on-board a small aerial vehicle and demonstrate the effectiveness of the above capabilities on real data.

As a result, they sense different accelerations when the platform is subjected to rotational motions. In this work, we derive a method for spatially calibrating multiple IMUs in a single estimator based on the open-source camera/IMU calibration toolbox kalibr.

The device consists of three Mitutoyo digital indicators, arranged in an orthogonal manner, and a mastering fixture based on kinematic coupling. The indicators communicate, via wireless connection, with a PC that controls the movements of the robot. To measure absolute Cartesian coordinates, the device is positioned incrementally over each of several 0.5-inch precision balls until all indicators are at zero, at which time the robot joint encoders are read. The balls are fixed with respect to the robot's base. The precise relative positions of the centers of these balls must be known in advance. In this study, the measuring device is mounted on the flange of an ABB IRB 120 robot. Only three precision balls are used, spaced 300 mm apart, and the distances between these balls are measured with a Renishaw telescoping ballbar. The absolute accuracy of the robot was enhanced by minimizing its position errors, using the least squares method. The feasibility of the calibration approach was demonstrated through a simulation study.

Geometric parameter errors and joint stiffness parameters are identified through measuring the position of the robot's end-effector in several robot configurations using a laser tracker. Contrary to previous works, robot's position errors are measured under a wide range of external forces and torques for each robot configuration. A 6-DOF cable-driven parallel robot is employed to automatically apply the desired load on the end-effector of the ABB robot. Before the experiment, an observability analysis is performed in order to improve the robustness of the calibration process with respect to measurement noise and unmodeled errors. Accordingly, an optimal set of robot configurations and external loads is selected for the calibration process. The measured position errors of the ABB robot for this selected set are used to identify the real robot's elasto-geometrical parameters. Finally, the calibration efficiency is evaluated for a number of random combinations of robot configurations and external loads.

The manual nature of this process produces training data that is unevenly spread in the camera relative pose space. If we desire camera parameters that perform well on average over the entire relative pose space, training on such a dataset results in poor performance. To address this, we show that reasoning about the training data distribution to select a more uniformly-spread subset of images produces more accurate and stable calibrations with fewer images. Our approach can be used easily with most camera calibration algorithms. We demonstrate in large-scale physical experiments the effect of non-uniform training data and show that our approach outperforms baselines in reprojection error and parameter variance."

We present a novel theoretical framework in which we sample the space of camera axis direction (which is bounded and hence can be densely sampled unlike the unbounded space of camera position) and show that geometric constraints arising from it reduce rest of the computation to simple operations of finding camera position as the intersection of 3 planes. These geometric constraints can be represented using indexed arrays which accelerate it further. The algorithm returns all sets of correspondences and associated camera poses having high geometric consensus.

Many solvers have been proposed to recover X given data streams {A i } and {B i } with correspondence. However, exact correspondence might not be accessible in the real world due to the asynchronous sensors and missing data, etc. A probabilistic approach named “Batch method” was introduced in previous research of our lab, which doesn't require a prior knowledge of the correspondence between the two data streams {A i } and {B j }. Analogous to non-probabilistic approaches which require data selection to filter out ill-conditioned data pairs, the Batch method has restrictions on the data set {A i } and {B j } that can be used.

The magnetic needle is 1.3mm in diameter at the tip with a 0.7mm diameter shaft, which is selected to match the size of a deep brain stimulation electrode. The tip orientation is controlled by applying torques to the embedded neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets with a clinically-sized magnetic-manipulation system. The prototype design is capable of following trajectories under human-in-the-loop control with minimum bend radii of 100mm without inducing tissue damage and down to 30mm if some tissue damage is tolerable.

However, the remote locations of these lesions, coupled with their origination in the submucosal layers of the gastrointestinal tract, often lead to extreme technical, cognitive and ergonomic challenges which combat the widespread applicability and adoption of these techniques. Among these challenges is achieving the in vivo dexterity required to retract and dissect tissue. By leveraging workspace and force data obtained through clinical studies, we developed a modular, disposable, distally-mounted actuator (an `active endcap') that can augment an endoscopist's distal dexterity in ways that are not achievable with the endoscope's built-in degrees-of-freedom. The device consists of a flexible articulating `exoskeleton' manufactured via printed-circuit MEMS (PCMEMS) which engages and deflects electrosurgical tools that are passed through the endoscopic working channel. Embedded proprioceptive sensing is implemented on-board using distributed LED/phototransistor pairs and the principle of light intensity modulation (LIM). The distal degree-of-freedom is actuated using shape memory alloy (SMA) technology, and the actuation transmission system is fully contained within a 1-inch-long end cap that can be mounted on the distal end of the endoscope, thereby obviating the need for a mechanical connection to a proximal source. Proof-of-concept tests demonstrate that the actuator adds over 50 degrees of distal articulation to existing tools and can generate 450 mN of lateral force which has been clinically determined to be sufficient for performing circumferential incisions in ESD."

K. Lau,Hongliang Ren,","Surgical robotic systems with miniaturized flexible Tendon-driven Serpentine Manipulators (TSM) have enjoyed increasing popularities among surgeons and researchers for their advantages of working in constrained and torturous human lumen such as oral cavity and upper GI tract. However, they suffer from sufficient nonlinearities and model uncertainties due to friction, tension varying, tendon slacking, etc. Model based control is insufficient to overcome such uncertainties and automate challenging surgical related tasks. The objective of this work is to automate certain clinical tasks to alleviate surgeon fatigue and promote task efficiency in kinematics free and sensor free circumstances. We present a data-driven approach based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which utilizes statistical machine learning models to encode system underlying dynamics and generalize smooth motor trajectories by direct actuation space learning. Motion segmentation is enabled with soft margin Support Vector Machine (soft-SVM) in complicated tasks. We also make attempts to retrieve task-specific properties by Locally Weighted Regression (LWR). We evaluated the approach on two surgical related tasks: compliant insertion and simplified Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). The flexible TSM successfully reproduced both tasks and demonstrated superior trajectory performance. A video is available at: https://youtu.be/rLQo6xKtyMI."

Cenk Çavuşoğlu,","The recent introduction of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-actuated steerable catheters lays the ground work for increasing the efficacy of cardiac catheter procedures. The MRI, while capable of imaging the catheter for tracking and control, does not fulfill all of the needs required to identify and develop a complete catheter model. Specifially, the frequency response of the catheter must be identified to ensure stable control of the catheter system. This requires a higher frequency imaging than the MRI can achieve. This work uses a catadioptric stereo camera system consisting of a mirror and a single camera in order to track a MRI actuated catheter inside a MRI machine. The catadioptric system works in parallel to the MRI and is capable of recording the catheter at 60 fps for post processing. The accuracy of the catadioptric system is verified in imaging conditions that would be found inside the MRI. The stereo camera is then used to track a catheter as it is actuated inside the MRI."

Carey,Ryan J. Murphy,Iulian Iordachita,Russell H. Taylor,,","Lesions of the lateral skull base in the petrous apex present unique surgical challenges because of the proximity of critical structures, including the inner ear, carotid artery, jugular bulb, facial nerve, lower cranial nerves, dura and brain. Currently, there are few appropriate surgical devices that can reach and remove these lesions, each with their own disadvantages. Here we investigate the feasibility of a dexterous continuum manipulator (DCM) capable of C-& S-shaped bends enabling dissection with remote center of motion (RCM) deep to the intact inner ear. A dedicated borescope channel provides the necessary visualization, while a flexible ring curette pre-shaped with a nitinol strip is designed to work through the instrument lumen for curettage of a cystic lesion. The kinematics of the DCM with the ring curette subject to an RCM constraint are investigated to explore the boundaries of a typical cyst cavity. Experiments in the planar phantom are carried out to validate feasibility, and results show that the proposed solution is practicable, accomplishing 80% and 83% removal of cysts for two kinds of boundaries."

Existing work has demonstrated robotic catheter steering in constrained bench top environments. Closed-loop control in an unconstrained setting, such as patient vasculature, remains a significant challenge due to friction, backlash, and physiological disturbances. In this paper we present a new method for closed-loop control of the catheter tip that can accurately and robustly steer 4-DOF cardiac catheters and other flexible manipulators despite these effects. The performance of the system is demonstrated in a vasculature phantom and an in vivo porcine animal model. During bench top studies the robotic system converged to the desired US imager pose with sub-millimeter and sub-degree-level accuracy. During animal trials the system achieved 2.0 mm and 0.65° accuracy.

Roesthuis,Nick J. van de Berg,John J. van den Dobbelsteen,,","Needle insertion procedures are commonly performed in current clinical practice for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Although prevailing technology allows accurate localization of lesions, they cannot yet be precisely targeted. Needle steering is a promising technique to overcome this challenge. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel steering system for an actuated-tip flexible needle. Strain measurements from an array of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are used for online reconstruction of the needle shape in 3D-space. FBG-sensor data is then fused with ultrasound images obtained from a clinically-approved Automated Breast Volume Scanner (ABVS) using an unscented Kalman filter. A new ultrasound-based tracking algorithm is developed for the robust tracking of the needle in biological tissue. Two experimental cases are presented to evaluate the proposed steering system. In the first case, the needle shape is reconstructed using the tracked tip position in ultrasound images and FBG-sensor measurements, separately. The reconstructed shape is then compared with the actual 3D needle shape obtained from the ABVS. In the second case, two steering experiments are performed to evaluate the overall system by fusing the FBG-sensor data and ultrasound images. Average targeting errors are 1.29±0.41 mm and 1.42±0.72 mm in gelatin phantom and biological tissue, respectively."
icra,None,Needle steering fusing direct base manipulation and tip-based control,"Jason Chevrie,Alexandre Krupa,Marie Babel,","Works on robotic needle steering often consider either tip-based control of flexible beveled tip needles or control of the bending of symmetric tip needles. In this paper a control law for needle steering which uses both direct manipulation of the needle base and the control of the tip deflection, is proposed. A 3D model of a beveled tip needle is used to determine the base motion that is needed to obtain the desired tip motion. The needle-tissue interaction model uses local virtual springs placed along the needle shaft and takes into account the interaction forces at the bevel. Online estimation and update of this model parameters is performed via visual feedback. The low level controller uses the task function framework to allow control of the tip velocity. Additionally duty cycling method is used if a reduction of the natural deflection of the needle tip is needed. Finally an experimental targeting task in a gelatin phantom is presented for preliminary validation of the framework. The method provided sub-millimeter accuracy on a target that would be unreachable using only tip-based control."

Bruns,Philip J. Swaney,Robert J.

In this paper, we describe how a differential representation of a continuum robot's kinematic equations that govern its states (e.g., shape) can be used to simultaneously address these problems under the guidance of statistical state estimation. We identify how state estimation and sensing-system design (i.e., sensor selection and placement) are inherently coupled problems, which leads us to formulate sensing-system design as an optimization problem governed by the results of statistical estimation. As a case-study, the methods described herein are used to design a magnetic sensing system for concentric-tube robots."
icra,None,Planar odometry from a radial laser scanner. A range flow-based approach,"Mariano Jaimez,Javier G. Monroy,Javier Gonzalez-Jimenez,","In this paper we present a fast and precise method to estimate the planar motion of a lidar from consecutive range scans. For every scanned point we formulate the range flow constraint equation in terms of the sensor velocity, and minimize a robust function of the resulting geometric constraints to obtain the motion estimate. Conversely to traditional approaches, this method does not search for correspondences but performs dense scan alignment based on the scan gradients, in the fashion of dense 3D visual odometry. The minimization problem is solved in a coarse-to-fine scheme to cope with large displacements, and a smooth filter based on the covariance of the estimate is employed to handle uncertainty in unconstraint scenarios (e.g. corridors). Simulated and real experiments have been performed to compare our approach with two prominent scan matchers and with wheel odometry. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach which, along with its very low computational cost (0.9 milliseconds on a single CPU core), makes it suitable for those robotic applications that require planar odometry. For this purpose, we also provide the code so that the robotics community can benefit from it."
icra,None,Collar Line Segments for fast odometry estimation from Velodyne point clouds,"Martin Velas,Michal Spanel,Adam Herout,","We present a novel way of odometry estimation from Velodyne LiDAR point cloud scans. The aim of our work is to overcome the most painful issues of Velodyne data - the sparsity and the quantity of data points - in an efficient way, enabling more precise registration. Alignment of the point clouds which yields the final odometry is based on random sampling of the clouds using Collar Line Segments (CLS). The closest line segment pairs are identified in two sets of line segments obtained from two consequent Velodyne scans. From each pair of correspondences, a transformation aligning the matched line segments into a 3D plane is estimated. By this, significant planes (ground, walls, ...) are preserved among aligned point clouds. Evaluation using the KITTI dataset shows that our method outperforms publicly available and commonly used state-of-the-art method GICP for point cloud registration in both accuracy and speed, especially in cases where the scene lacks significant landmarks or in typical urban elements. For such environments, the registration error of our method is reduced by 75% compared to the original GICP error."

In this paper we present a novel model-free approach for detecting and tracking dynamic objects in 3D LiDAR scans obtained by a moving sensor. Our method only relies on motion cues and does not require any prior information about the objects. We sequentially detect multiple motions in the scene and segment objects using a Bayesian approach. For robustly tracking objects, we utilize their estimated motion models. We present extensive quantitative results based on publicly available datasets and show that our approach outperforms the state of the art."

In this paper we present a novel approach for 2D ground-plan-like laser-range-data-based room categorization that builds on a compositional hierarchical representation of space, and show how an additional abstraction layer, whose parts are formed by merging partial views of the environment followed by graph extraction, can achieve improved categorization performance. A new algorithm is presented that finds a dictionary of exemplar elements from a multi-category set, based on the affinity measure defined among pairs of elements. This algorithm is used for part selection in new layer construction. Room categorization experiments have been performed on a challenging publicly available dataset, which has been extended in this work.

With the goal of controlling high-speed micro air vehicles (MAVs), we localize with respect to a mesh map of the environment that can support both pose estimation and trajectory planning. Using only limited hardware that can be carried on a MAV, we achieve accurate pose estimation at rates above 50 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art mesh-based localization algorithms. In our simultaneous tracking and rendering (STAR) approach, we render virtual images of the environment and track camera images with respect to them using a robust semi-direct image alignment technique. Our main contribution is the decoupling of camera tracking from virtual image rendering, which drastically reduces the number of rendered images and enables accurate full camera-rate tracking without needing a high-end GPU. We demonstrate our approach in GPS-denied indoor environments."
icra,None,Noise mask for TDOA sound source localization of speech on mobile robots in noisy environments,"François Grondin,François Michaud,","Sound source localization is an important challenge for mobile robots operating in real life settings. Sound sources of interest, such as speech, are often corrupted by broadband coherent noise sound source(s) that are non-stationary during transitions between steady-state segments. The interfering noise introduces localization ambiguities leading to the localization of invalid sound sources. Masks to reduce such interferences perform well under stationary noise, but the performance degrades as localization of invalid sound sources generated by noise appear and disappear suddenly during transitions between steady-state. This paper presents a new mask based on speech non-stationarity to discriminate between the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of speech source and noise transition. Simulations and experiments on a mobile robot suggest that the proposed technique improve TDOA discrimination and reduces significantly localization of invalid sound sources caused by noise."

icra,None,Probabilistic sensor data processing for robot localization on load-sensing floors,"Maxime Rio,Francis Colas,Mihai Andries,François Charpillet,","Load-sensing floors are capable of tracking objects without suffering from occlusions nor posing the same privacy issues as cameras. They have been mostly used to analyze human gait as a way of continuous diagnosis but could also be placed alongside robots to help monitoring in specialized institutions, such as elderly care facilities. However, large-scale deployments necessitate cheap sensors which do not necessarily offer the same precision. With more noisy sensors, lighter robots might be difficult to track and precisely localize. In this article, we investigate various models in order to estimate the position of a robot. We experiment with several robots of different weights and compare the models' estimates against ground truth measurements provided by a motion capture system. We show that with standard-sized tiles of 60 cm, we can track even the lighter robots with less than 4 cm of error."
icra,None,Towards a hyperbolic acoustic one-way localization system for underwater swarm robotics,"Andreas René Geist,Axel Hackbarth,Edwin Kreuzer,Viktor Rausch,,,",A hyperbolic acoustic system for underwater robot self-localization is presented. Anchored transducers send acoustic signals which are observed by a receiver. The system is passive with one-way signal transmission. Time differences of arrival (TDOAs) between the emitted signals are estimated by the receiver via cross-correlation. These TDOAs are fed to an Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the global position of the receiver. We describe the complete signal processing chain as well as challenges in hardware and software design. Experimental results in air and water show the feasibility of the system. This paper demonstrates that acoustic one-way localization is possible with off-the-shelf hardware in experimental test tanks.

We firstly evaluate the performance of probabilistic similarity measures applied to received signal strength (RSS) and compare them with previous results obtained with well known vector similarity measures. We furthermore extend the observation model used in a particle filter to dynamically adapt to the uncertainty of single candidate fingerprints by using their similarity to the current observation. For this purpose, we derive a new likelihood function and introduce an alternative way of selecting candidate fingerprints using a combination of their signal space similarity as well as the distance between the currently estimated pose and reference fingerprints. Results obtained from experiments in two different environments highlight the improved accuracy as well as robustness of the proposed methods."
icra,None,Fast localization and tracking using event sensors,"Wenzhen Yuan,Srikumar Ramalingam,","The success of many robotics applications hinges on the speed at which the underlying sensing and inference tasks are carried out. Many high-speed applications such as autonomous driving and evasive maneuvering of quadrotors require high run time performance, which traditional cameras can seldom provide. In this paper we develop a fast localization and tracking algorithm using an event sensor, which produces on the order of million asynchronous events per second at pixels where luminance changes. The events are usually fired at the high gradient pixels (edges), where luminance changes occur as the sensor moves. We develop a fast spatio-temporal binning scheme to detect lines from these events at the edges. We represent the 3D model of the world using vertical lines, and the sensor pose can be estimated using the correspondences from 2D event lines to 3D world lines. The inherent simplicity of our method enables us to achieve a run time performance of 1000 Hertz."
icra,None,A practical optimal control approach for two-speed actuators,"Alexandre Girard,H. Harry Asada,","This paper addresses the closed-loop control of an actuator with both a continuous input variable (motor torque) and a discrete input variable (mode selection). In many applications, robots have to bear large loads while moving slowly and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load, leading to conflicting requirements for their actuators. An actuator with multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, can address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However, having discrete modes of operation adds complexity to the high-level control and planning. Here a controller for two-speed actuators that automatically select both the best gear ratio and the motor torque is developed. The approach is to: first derive a low-dimensional model, then use dynamic programming to find the best actions for all possible situations, and last use regression analysis to extract simplified global feedback laws. This approach produces simple practical nearly-optimal feedback laws. A controller that globally minimizes a quadratic cost function is derived for a two-speed actuator prototype, global stability is proven and performance is demonstrated experimentally."

While this approach works reasonably well in practice on benign terrain, it fails very quickly when the WMR is deployed in terrain that induces significant wheel slip. We contribute a novel control framework that predictively corrects for the wheel slip to effectively minimize path following errors. Our framework, the Receding Horizon Model Predictive Path Follower (RHMPPF), specifically addresses the problem of path following in challenging environments where the wheel slip substantially affects the vehicle mobility. We formulate the solution to the problem as an optimal controller that utilizes a slip-aware model predictive component to effectively correct the controls generated by a strictly geometric pure-pursuit path follower. We present extensive experimental validation of our approach using a simulated 6-wheel skid-steered robot in a high-fidelity data-driven simulator, and on a real 4-wheel skid-steered robot. Our results show substantial improvement in the path following performance in both simulation and real world experiments."

icra,None,Model-predictive control with stochastic collision avoidance using Bayesian policy optimization,"Olov Andersson,Mariusz Wzorek,Piotr Rudol,Patrick Doherty,","Robots are increasingly expected to move out of the controlled environment of research labs and into populated streets and workplaces. Collision avoidance in such cluttered and dynamic environments is of increasing importance as robots gain more autonomy. However, efficient avoidance is fundamentally difficult since computing safe trajectories may require considering both dynamics and uncertainty. While heuristics are often used in practice, we take a holistic stochastic trajectory optimization perspective that merges both collision avoidance and control. We examine dynamic obstacles moving without prior coordination, like pedestrians or vehicles. We find that common stochastic simplifications lead to poor approximations when obstacle behavior is difficult to predict. We instead compute efficient approximations by drawing upon techniques from machine learning. We propose to combine policy search with model-predictive control. This allows us to use recent fast constrained model-predictive control solvers, while gaining the stochastic properties of policy-based methods. We exploit recent advances in Bayesian optimization to efficiently solve the resulting probabilistically-constrained policy optimization problems. Finally, we present a real-time implementation of an obstacle avoiding controller for a quadcopter. We demonstrate the results in simulation as well as with real flight experiments."

As this sampling process often leads to a local minimum especially when the state space is highly non-convex due to the obstacle field, we present an efficient method to alleviate this issue by devising a proposed topological motion planning algorithm. Combined with a receding-horizon scheme in execution of the optimal control solution, the proposed method can generate a dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectory while reducing concern about local optima. Illustrative numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed approach."

The exoskeleton is lightweight and moderate in assistance power compared to other hip exoskeletons in the literature. Its controller estimates user gait phase, walking speed, and ground inclinations to generate assistance torque adaptively. To assess the physiological effect of the gait assistance, we compared metabolic energy consumption for 5 adults for walking on a treadmill with and without the exoskeleton at the same speed: the exoskeleton reduced metabolic cost of walking by 13% (p = 0:0024). The step length and the stride time increased under the assistance. Our analysis for the result suggests that the efficiency of hip exoskeletons on saving metabolic energy can be twice as high as that of ankle exoskeletons possibly because muscle-tendon unit in the hip joint is less energy-efficient than in the ankle joint."
icra,None,Hierarchical planning of dynamic movements without scheduled contact sequences,"Carlos Mastalli,Ioannis Havoutis,Michele Focchi,Darwin G. Caldwell,,","Most animal and human locomotion behaviors for solving complex tasks involve dynamic motions and rich contact interaction. In fact, complex maneuvers need to consider dynamic movement and contact events at the same time. We present a hierarchical trajectory optimization approach for planning dynamic movements with unscheduled contact sequences. We compute whole-body motions that achieve goals that cannot be reached in a kinematic fashion. First, we find a feasible CoM motion according to the centroidal dynamics of the robot. Then, we refine the solution by applying the robot's full-dynamics model, where the feasible CoM trajectory is used as a warm-start point. To accomplish the unscheduled contact behavior, we use complementarity constraints to describe the contact model, i.e. environment geometry and non-sliding active contacts. Both optimization phases are posed as Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Experimental trials demonstrate the performance of our planning approach in a set of challenging tasks."

In such cases, it is convenient to revise the given goal adjacency matrix so that it is more apt to the robots' configuration. In this paper, we present a solution to this problem. For this, we first formulate the problem as finding an optimal isomorphic adjacency matrix and then propose a two-stage method for solving it. In the first stage, an optimal orthogonal matrix that solves the problem is determined while in the second stage, the search for the optimal permutation matrix is conducted - based on the approximation of the resulting orthogonal matrix by a non-commutative convex combination of permutation matrices. Extensive simulation results indicate that an adjacency matrix that is more apt to the robots' locations can be determined with the optimality of the resulting solution tuning the accuracy parameter."

Weighing 4.0 grams and operating at frequencies in excess of 90Hz, the platform is capable of generating a lift-to-weight ratio of approximately 1.3 and demonstrated lift-off tethered to an external power supply. From a previous electromagnetic actuator design, the coil cross-section profile was reshaped and “virtual spring” magnets were relocated to reduce mass and improve overall efficiency. Conducting experiments on a set of reconfigured actuators paired back-to-back, a magnetic interaction torque was discovered coupling the response of the combine system. Investigations into this interaction revealed a wing-to-wing synchronization effect accounting for asymmetries in the individual actuators and resulted in a system equilibria bifurcation with decreases to their separation distance. The coupling of the combined system bears a striking resemblance to the biomechanical linkage system in Dipteran flies which has also been shown to result in the synchronization of asymmetric wings. With the current embodiment of the robotic platform serving as a proof-of-concept for later iterations, a scaling of the system to the order of insects is predicted to have lift-to-weight ratios near two and will be the target for future work."

Compared with the horizontal rowing motion, the jumping capability of water striders is challengeable to imitate, since the impact force on water is easy to cause the sinking of the robot. In this paper, a jumping mechanism based on springs is designed to produce a large thrust for the robot to jump. The shape of supporting legs and center of gravity of the robot are carefully designed so that the robot can jump on the surface continuously and smoothly. Influences of several critical factors, including the area of supporting legs, spring stiffness and jumping angle, on jump performance are analyzed by means of dynamic simulation and experiments.

The robot consists of actuated chain segments, thus enabling it to change its form, independent of guiding mechanisms. Using integrated sensors, the robot is able to adapt to the terrain and to overcome obstacles. This allows the robot to “roll” and climb in two dimensions. Possible extensions of the concept to three-dimensional navigation are presented as an outlook."
icra,None,A structurally flexible humanoid spine based on a tendon-driven elastic continuum,"Jens Reinecke,Bastian Deutschmann,David Fehrenbach,","When working in unknown environments, it is beneficial for robots to be mechanically robust to impacts. To obtain such robustness properties and maintain human-like performance, strength, workspace and size especially in the upper body, an elastic backbone approach is presented and discussed. Compared to the human spine stabilized by ligaments, intervertebral discs and muscles, we use a continuum mechanism based on silicone and tendons for actuation. The work presents the development of such a mechanism, that could be either used as neck or torso, but concentrates on the cervical part (neck). To prove functionality of the proposed concept, a planar setup was designed and experimental data regarding motion capabilities, robustness and dynamics are presented. With that knowledge, a modular multiple DOF prototype is built which can easily be equipped with different tendon routing and elastic continuum shapes. The results of that final setup will help the mechanical designer to choose the suitable solution for the robotic spine and provides a test bed to develop control strategies for such types of mechanisms."
icra,None,Circumnutations as a penetration strategy in a plant-root-inspired robot,"Emanuela Del Dottore,Alessio Mondini,Ali Sadeghi,Virgilio Mattoli,,","In this paper, we present a study on peculiar plant root movements, named circumnutations, adopted by plants as an efficient strategy to penetrate the soil and implemented in robotic roots to improve their performance in exploration tasks. The robotic root is able to bend and interact with soil owing to a soft actuation mechanism based on the translation of rotary to linear motion by means of helical compression springs. The robotic root integrates a stimulus-oriented behavior combined with circumnutation movements, which leads to an extraordinarily large reduction (more than 80 times) of the force needed for penetration in artificial soil (sawdust) while performing circumnutations with respect to a straightforward movement."
icra,None,"Distributed sensing and nonlinear MISO models for predicting the propulsive forces of flexible, multi-DOF robotic fins","Jeff C Kahn,James L. Tangorra,","Fish are capable of producing a wide repertoire of 3D propulsive forces using their fins, and have inspired the development of compliant, multiple-DOF, robotic fins with similar capabilities. Most of these robotic fins are under open-loop control on propulsive force because the forces are challenging to model. Understanding how to predict propulsive forces for these types of fins would significantly advance the state of the art towards closed-loop control of forces. Distributed sensors within robotic fins have been used to predict propulsive forces using linear models, but these models fail to predict forces when fin kinematics become more complex. The objective of the work presented herein is to understand the use of nonlinear, multiple-input-single-output (MISO) Volterra series models between intrinsic sensory measurements and propulsive forces of a flexible robotic fin. Techniques in nonlinear system identification are used to address model conditioning. Nonlinear models predict the propulsive forces well, capturing features of both thrust and lateral forces. Nonlinear models significantly outperformed linear models both in cost of implementation and performance. The best sensor sampling practice was to sample from multiple locations with both pressure and bending modalities. Distributed sensing paired with nonlinear Volterra series models was successful for predicting the forces created by flexible robotic fins with complex kinematics and multiple degrees of freedom."
icra,None,Speed evaluation of a freely swimming robotic fish with an artificial lateral line,"Wei Wang,Yuan Li,Xingxing Zhang,Chen Wang,Shiming Chen,,","Artificial lateral line has been drawing an increasing attention recently for its potential applications in robotics. Experiments are usually conducted with a bioinspired robot in a controlled environment, where the sensing platform is held stationary or slowly driven with a simple linear motion. In this paper, we conduct a more practical and challenging study where the robot uses artificial lateral line to evaluate its linear velocity while freely swimming. We use onboard artificial lateral line to measure the pressure profiles over the surface of a robotic fish and employ onboard IMU (inertial measurement unit) to record the motion kinematics of the robot while freely swimming at various speeds. We find that 1) pressure changes are greatest on the head of the robot; 2) pressures increase along with the swimming speed and the oscillation amplitude of angular velocity of the robot. Therefore, we propose a nonlinear prediction model which incorporates distributed pressure and angular velocity to estimate the speed of the robot. Online speed evaluation experiment demonstrates the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed model."
icra,None,A tether-less Legged Piezoelectric Miniature Robot using bounding gait locomotion for bidirectional motion,"Hassan H. Hariri,Leonardus A. Prasetya,Shaohui Foong,Gim Song Soh,,,","This paper describes the design and evaluation of a Legged Piezoelectric Miniature Robot (LPMR) propelled by standing wave vibrations at the legs, which are biologically inspired by the bounding gait locomotion of animals. The LPMR comprises of a single piezoelectric patch, a metal beam, two contact joints, two rigid legs and is able to achieve tether-less remote controlled operation. Through analysis of the bending modes of vibrations and driving frequency, a forward and backward motion of the underactuated system is achieved by choosing specific positions for the legs. At 100 V amplitude, the LPMR with the weight of 6.27 g, length of 50 mm, width of 10 mm and height of 1.5 mm achieves a maximum linear speed of 246.5 mm/s for forward motion and 302 mm/s for backward motion. The LPMR is also able to carry a payload of 100 g at a speed of 49.6 mm/s for forward motion and 87.9 mm/s for backward motion when applying 100 V amplitude. The corresponding maximum force generated by the LPMR is 9.8 mN during forward motion and 12 mN during backward motion at the same applied voltage. An experimental characterization for the LPMR in terms of speed versus applied voltage, speed versus embedded mass and blocking force for different applied voltages is explored and evaluated in this study."
icra,None,Depth control of the biomimetic U-CAT turtle-like AUV with experiments in real operating conditions,"A. Chemori,K. Kuusmik,T. Salumäe,M. Kruusmaa,","Control of underwater vehicles is a thoroughly investigated subject but still an open problem, because of the environmental disturbances, the highly nonlinear behaviour of vehicles, the complexity of the vehicle hydrodynamics, etc. In this paper, we are interested in depth control of a bioinspired U-CAT underwater AUV in real operating conditions. Two depth control schemes are proposed, including a PID controller and a nonlinear RISE feedback controller. The proposed controllers are implemented on the robot, then tested in an open water environment. The obtained results are presented and discussed through different experimental scenarios to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed controllers, not only to successfully control the depth, but also to be robust towards external disturbances and parameters uncertainties. we conclude that RISE controller is more robust towards environmental disturbances and outperforms the PID controller when the robot is tested in real operating condition."
icra,None,Absolute pose estimation using multiple forms of correspondences from RGB-D frames,"Shuda Li,Andrew Calway,","We describe a new approach to absolute pose estimation from noisy and outlier contaminated matching point sets for RGB-D sensors. We show that by integrating multiple forms of correspondence based on 2-D and 3-D points and surface normals gives more precise, accurate and robust pose estimates. This is because it gives more constraints than using one form alone and increases the available measurements, especially when dealing with sparse matching sets. We demonstrate the approach by incorporating it within a RANSAC algorithm and introduce a novel direct least-square approach to calculate pose estimates. Results from experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate improved performance over existing methods."
icra,None,Modelling uncertainty in deep learning for camera relocalization,"Alex Kendall,Roberto Cipolla,","We present a robust and real-time monocular six degree of freedom visual relocalization system. We use a Bayesian convolutional neural network to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image. It is trained in an end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking under 6ms to compute. It obtains approximately 2m and 6° accuracy for very large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 10° accuracy indoors. Using a Bayesian convolutional neural network implementation we obtain an estimate of the model's relocalization uncertainty and improve state of the art localization accuracy on a large scale outdoor dataset. We leverage the uncertainty measure to estimate metric relocalization error and to detect the presence or absence of the scene in the input image. We show that the model's uncertainty is caused by images being dissimilar to the training dataset in either pose or appearance."
icra,None,Object-aware bundle adjustment for correcting monocular scale drift,"Duncan P. Frost,Olaf Kähler,David W. Murray,","Without knowledge of the absolute baseline between images, the scale of a map from single-camera simultaneous localization and mapping system is subject to calamitous drift over time. We describe a monocular approach that in addition to point measurements also considers object detections to resolve this scale ambiguity and drift. By placing a prior on the size of the objects, the scale estimation can be seamlessly integrated into a bundle adjustment. When object observations are available, the local scale of the map is then determined jointly with the camera pose in local adjustments. Unlike many previous visual odometry methods, our approach does not impose restrictions such as approximately constant camera height or planar roadways, and is therefore applicable to a much wider range of applications. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI dataset and show that it reduces scale drift over long-range outdoor sequences with a total length of 40 km. Qualitative evaluation is also performed on video footage from a hand-held camera."
icra,None,Localization accuracy estimation with application to perception design,"Jan Rohde,Jan Erik Stellet,Holger Mielenz,J. Marius Zöllner,","Landmark-based localization in dynamic environments poses high demands on the perception system of a mobile robot. The pose estimate generally has to fulfill specific accuracy requirements which might be necessitated by dependent systems, such as behavior planning. Thus, in this contribution we focus on the model-based derivation of perception requirements, i.e. detectable landmark types and minimum detection rates, to enable global localization with a specified upper bound on uncertainty. To this end, we utilize stochastic geometry to accurately capture and explicitly consider characteristics of the dynamic environment (e.g. occlusions), and the perception system (e.g. missed detections). From this point our contributions are twofold: i) We propose an analytical model of upper bounds on localization uncertainty. For continuous pose tracking, the Kalman filter equations for intermittent observations are considered and ii) perception requirements, i.e. minimum detection rates, based on specified upper bounds on pose estimation uncertainty are derived. Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods."
icra,None,Fast and effective online pose estimation and mapping for UAVs,"Johannes Schneider,Christian Eling,Lasse Klingbeil,Heiner Kuhlmann,,,","Online pose estimation and mapping in unknown environments is essential for most mobile robots. Especially autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles require good pose estimates at comparably high frequencies. In this paper, we propose an effective system for online pose and simultaneous map estimation designed for light-weight UAVs. Our system consists of two components: (1) real-time pose estimation combining RTK-GPS and IMU at 100 Hz and (2) an effective SLAM solution running at 10 Hz using image data from an omnidirectional multi-fisheye-camera system. The SLAM procedure combines spatial resection computed based on the map that is incrementally refined through bundle adjustment and combines the image data with raw GPS observations and IMU data on keyframes. The overall system yields a real-time, georeferenced pose at 100 Hz in GPS-friendly situations. Additionally, we obtain a precise pose and feature map at 10 Hz even in cases where the GPS is not observable or underconstrained. Our system has been implemented and thoroughly tested on a 5 kg copter and yields accurate and reliable pose estimation at high frequencies. We compare the point cloud obtained by our method with a model generated from georeferenced terrestrial laser scanner."
icra,None,Non-uniform sampling strategies for continuous correction based trajectory estimation,"Renaud Dubé,Hannes Sommer,Abel Gawel,Michael Bosse,Roland Siegwart,","Sliding window estimation is widely used for online simultaneous localization and mapping. While increasing the sliding window size generally yields improved accuracy, it also comes at an increase in computational cost. In order to reduce this cost, we propose smarter non-uniform sampling of the trajectory representation over the sliding window. This non-uniform temporal resolution is possible with continuous-time representations that allow freely adjustable knots location. Four strategies for selecting the knots location are presented and evaluated based on a real data laser-odometry SLAM problem. The results clearly show that non-uniform distributions of knots can be superior to uniform distribution in terms of accuracy per computation time."
icra,None,The line leading the blind: Towards nonvisual localization and mapping for tethered mobile robots,"Patrick McGarey,Kirk MacTavish,François Pomerleau,Timothy D. Barfoot,","Mobile robots supported by an electromechanical tether can safely explore extremely rugged terrain in resource-limited environments. While a tether provides power, wired communication, and support on steep surfaces, it also reduces maneuverability; in cluttered environments the tether will contact obstacles, forming intermediate anchor points. In order for the robot to avoid tether entanglement, it must localize itself with respect to any added anchor points. Accordingly, we present a first approach towards nonvisual localization and mapping that utilizes tether measurements and wheel odometry to jointly estimate vehicle trajectory and tether-to-obstacle contact points. The proposed method is inspired by FastSLAM, where instead of updating a map of landmarks, tether length and bearing measurements are used to update sequential lists of anchor points for every particle representing a belief of the robot's trajectory. Results from both simulation and experiment using our Tethered Robotic eXplorer (TReX) demonstrate that (i) our method is more accurate than odometry alone, and (ii) we are able to map intermediate anchor points nonvisually."
icra,None,Vision-based robot localization across seasons and in remote locations,"Anirudh Viswanathan,Bernardo R. Pires,Daniel Huber,","This paper studies the problem of GPS-denied unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) localization by matching ground images to a satellite map. We examine the realistic, but particularly challenging problem of navigation in remote areas using maps that may correspond to a different season of the year. The problem is difficult due to the limited UGV sensor horizon, the drastic shift in perspective between ground and aerial views, the absence of discriminative features in the environment due to the remote location, and the high variation in appearance of the satellite map caused by the change in seasons. We present an approach to image matching using semantic information that is invariant to seasonal change. This semantics-based matching is incorporated into a particle filter framework and successful localization of the ground vehicle is demonstrated for satellite maps captured in summer, spring, and winter."
icra,None,2D visual place recognition for domestic service robots at night,"James Mount,Michael Milford,","Domestic service robots such as lawn mowing and vacuum cleaning robots are the most numerous consumer robots in existence today. While early versions employed random exploration, recent systems fielded by most of the major manufacturers have utilized range-based and visual sensors and user-placed beacons to enable robots to map and localize. However, active range and visual sensing solutions have the disadvantages of being intrusive, expensive, or only providing a 1D scan of the environment, while the requirement for beacon placement imposes other practical limitations. In this paper we present a passive and potentially cheap vision-based solution to 2D localization at night that combines easily obtainable day-time maps with low resolution contrast-normalized image matching algorithms, image sequence-based matching in two-dimensions, place match interpolation and recent advances in conventional low light camera technology. In a range of experiments over a domestic lawn and in a lounge room, we demonstrate that the proposed approach enables 2D localization at night, and analyse the effect on performance of varying odometry noise levels, place match interpolation and sequence matching length. Finally we benchmark the new low light camera technology and show how it can enable robust place recognition even in an environment lit only by a moonless sky, raising the tantalizing possibility of being able to apply all conventional vision algorithms, even in the darkest of nights."
icra,None,Point cloud descriptors for place recognition using sparse visual information,"Titus Cieslewski,Elena Stumm,Abel Gawel,Mike Bosse,Simon Lynen,,","Place recognition is a core component in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), limiting positional drift over space and time to unlock precise robot navigation. Determining which previously visited places belong together continues to be a highly active area of research as robotic applications demand increasingly higher accuracies. A large number of place recognition algorithms have been proposed, capable of consuming a variety of sensor data including laser, sonar and depth readings. The best performing solutions, however, have utilized visual information by either matching entire images or parts thereof. Most commonly, vision based approaches are inspired by information retrieval and utilize 3D-geometry information about the observed scene as a post-verification step. In this paper we propose to use the 3D-scene information from sparse-visual feature maps directly at the core of the place recognition pipeline. We propose a novel structural descriptor which aggregates sparse triangulated landmarks from SLAM into a compact signature. The resulting 3D-features provide a discriminative fingerprint to recognize places over seasonal and viewpoint changes which are particularly challenging for approaches based on sparse visual descriptors. We evaluate our system on publicly available datasets and show how its complementary nature can provide an improvement over visual place recognition."
icra,None,Do you see the bakery? Leveraging geo-referenced texts for global localization in public maps,"Noha Radwan,Gian Diego Tipaldi,Luciano Spinello,Wolfram Burgard,","Text is one of the richest sources of information in an urban environment. Although textual information is heavily relied on by humans for a majority of the daily tasks, its usage has not been completely exploited in the field of robotics. In this work, we propose a localization approach utilizing textual features in urban environments. Starting at an unknown location, equipped with an RGB-camera and a compass, our approach uses off-the-shelf text extraction methods to identify text labels in the vicinity. We then apply a probabilistic localization approach with specific sensor models to integrate multiple observations. An extensive evaluation with real-world data gathered in different cities reveals an improvement over GPS-based localization when using our method."
icra,None,Making objects graspable in confined environments through push and pull manipulation with a tool,"Sarah Elliott,Michelle Valente,Maya Cakmak,","Grasping objects in confined environments, such as shelves, fridges, or drawers, is challenging due to the difficulty of avoiding gripper and arm collisions with the surfaces surrounding the object. In this paper we explore the use of a tool to reconfigure objects in such environments so as to make them graspable. The proposed tool has a simple form that allows it to be used in confined environments and a high friction tool tip that enables not only pushing objects but also pulling them. Our approach involves learning predictive models of pre-defined object-directed tool actions from experience. For each action, we train a multi-modal regressor that maps the initial state of an object to changes in that state, such that future states of the object can be estimated. These allow the robot to choose a sequence of tool actions that yield graspable configurations. We demonstrate that our approach enables a PR2 robot to grasp five different objects from different, initially ungraspable, configurations on a shelf."
icra,None,Synergy-based interface for bilateral tele-manipulations of a master-slave system with large asymmetries,"A. Brygo,I. Sarakoglou,A. Ajoudani,N.G Hernandez,G. Grioli,M. Catalano,,,","In this work a novel synergy-based bilateral tele-manipulation strategy is introduced. The proposed algorithm has been primarily developed to remotely control the Pisa/IIT SoftHand (SH) using a 3-finger hand exoskeleton as master device. With a single actuator and a sensory system limited to a position encoder and a current sensor, the SH minimalist design promotes robustness but challenges traditional teleoperation strategies. To tackle this challenge, the concept of Cartesian-based hand synergies is introduced as a projection tool which maps the fingertip Cartesian space to the directions oriented along the grasp principal components. The unconstrained motion of the operator's hand is projected on this space to extract the SH's motor position reference. Conversely, the interaction force estimated at the robotic hand as a 1-dimensional force along the first synergy is projected to the 9D fingertip Cartesian space through an inverse projection. The resultant finger-individualized forces form a synergy based weighted representation of the grasping effort applied by the SH and are displayed to the operators fingertips using the force feedback hand exoskeleton. The system's ability to reflect the environment's impedance has been experimentally validated during a ball squeezing experiment. To assess the overall effectiveness of the proposed system as a manipulation interface, the SoftHand was mounted on the humanoid robot COMAN and the setup was subsequently enriched with a vision-based tracking system monitoring the operators wrist trajectory. Experimental results indicate that the proposed body-machine bilateral interface allows for the intuitive performance of stable grasps and transport of a large range of diversely shaped objects."
icra,None,Denoising auto-encoders for learning of objects and tools affordances in continuous space,"Atabak Dehban,Lorenzo Jamone,Adam R. Kampff,José Santos-Victor,","The concept of affordances facilitates the encoding of relations between actions and effects in an environment centered around the agent. Such an interpretation has important impacts on several cognitive capabilities and manifestations of intelligence, such as prediction and planning. In this paper, a new framework based on denoising Auto-encoders (dA) is proposed which allows an agent to explore its environment and actively learn the affordances of objects and tools by observing the consequences of acting on them. The dA serves as a unified framework to fuse multi-modal data and retrieve an entire missing modality or a feature within a modality given information about other modalities. This work has two major contributions. First, since training the dA is done in continuous space, there will be no need to discretize the dataset and higher accuracies in inference can be achieved with respect to approaches in which data discretization is required (e.g. Bayesian networks). Second, by fixing the structure of the dA, knowledge can be added incrementally making the architecture particularly useful in online learning scenarios. Evaluation scores of real and simulated robotic experiments show improvements over previous approaches while the new model can be applied in a wider range of domains."
icra,None,"Flexible, semi-autonomous grasping for assistive robotics","Jörn Vogel,Katharina Hertkorn,Rohit U. Menon,Máximo A. Roa,","This paper proposes a scheme to provide flexible semi-autonomous grasping capabilities to an assistive robotic manipulator. The testbed consists of a five-finger robotic hand mounted on a robotic arm. During teleoperation, the position of the hand is continuously controlled in the three translational degrees of freedom, and the user has no direct influence over the rotational behavior. The proposed semi-autonomy scheme assists the user for moving and orienting the hand towards the object, and automates the grasping process when it is triggered. The velocity commands issued by the user are enhanced using virtual fixtures, which are not preprogrammed to support one approach direction to the (known) object, but are adapted online according to the intended movement. The approach is validated with a psycho-physical user study where the participants grasp objects in a simulation environment using a SpaceMouse interface. This setting serves as a testbed for the target application in which disabled subjects will control the real robotic system with an interface based on bio-signals. The user study compares the semi-autonomous and the pure teleoperation modes in terms of objective and subjective measures, showing an increase in performance and a decrease in workload for the proposed semi-autonomous mode."
icra,None,Swing-up regrasping algorithm using energy control,"Avishai Sintov,Amir Shapiro,","In this paper we propose an energy control based algorithm for performing swing-up regrasping. In such regrasping motion, an object is manipulated using a robotic arm around a point pinched by the arms gripper. The aim is to manipulate the object from an initial angle to regrasp it on a new desired angle relative to the gripper. The pinching point function as a semi-active joint where the gripper is able to apply only dissipative frictional torques on the object to resist its motion. We address the problem by proposing an algorithm based on energy control. Simulations on a three degrees of freedom manipulator regrasping a bar validate the proposed algorithm."

Reza Motamedi,Jean-Baptiste Chossat,Jean-Philippe Roberge,,","This paper explores the use of haptic and visual feedback during routine object-manipulation tasks. We conducted tests of slippage detection, contact detection, and grasp control, with the help of twelve human participants. During the tests, the subjects controlled the robotic arm of a UR5 Universal Robot that was mounted with a three-finger robotic gripper and equipped with tactile sensors. The participants used either their visual feedback, vibrotactile feedback, or pressure feedback to assess the movements of the robotic fingers as they attempted to complete each task. We analyzed their performance with each type of feedback in order to evaluate how haptic feedback may be used to reduce the need for visual attention, and thus improve the lives of upper-limb amputees."

Although cooking large amount of foods are done by specially designed cooking machines, dishing up the cooked foods remains as a labor-intensive task. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new food handling gripper which is suitable for lunch box setout considering appetizing shape of presentation. A two degree-of-freedom multi-fingered gripper with a sliding push part was developed, and evaluated by grasping experiments with noodles and simmered foods. The gripper could put the food with a circular cone shape and control the amount of grasped food."

Towards the goal of autonomous object manipulation in space, adhesive grippers mounted on planar free-floating platforms are shown to be tolerant of a broad range of incoming linear and angular velocities. Through modeling, simulations, and experiments, we characterize the dynamic “grasping envelope” for successful acquisition and derive insights to inform future gripper designs and grasping strategies for motion planning."
icra,None,Interactive computational imaging for deformable object analysis,"Donald G. Dansereau,Surya P. N. Singh,Jürgen Leitner,","We describe an interactive approach for visual object analysis which exploits the ability of a robot to manipulate its environment. Knowledge of objects' mechanical properties is important in a host of robotics tasks, but their measurement can be impractical due to perceptual or mechanical limitations. By applying a periodic stimulus and matched video filtering and analysis pipeline, we show that even stiff, fragile, or low-texture objects can be distinguished based on their mechanical behaviours. We construct a novel, linear filter exploiting periodicity of the stimulus to reduce noise, enhance contrast, and amplify motion by a selectable gain - the proposed filter is significantly simpler than previous approaches to motion amplification. We further propose a set of statistics based on dense optical flow derived from the filtered video, and demonstrate visual object analysis based on these statistics for objects offering low contrast and limited deflection. Finally, we analyze 7 object types over 59 trials under varying illumination and pose, demonstrating that objects are linearly distinguishable under this approach, and establish the viability of estimating fluid level in a cup from the same statistics."
icra,None,A new interaction force decomposition maximizing compensating forces under physical work constraints,"Alexander M. Schmidts,Manuel Schneider,Markus Kühne,Angelika Peer,","In manipulation tasks interaction forces are often decomposed to be able to control robustness-reflective and accelerating forces separately. While this decomposition is typically performed for the synthesis of interaction forces to be applied for example in the context of robotic grasping, less attention has been paid to the analysis of measured, human interaction forces. Here, we introduce a physically-motivated bounding constraint, based on the law of energy conservation, and present a new decomposition approach for interaction force analysis with rigid objects. The decomposition extends the intuitive solution known in literature for the two finger grasp by maximizing robustness-reflective forces while respecting the bounding constraint. Advantages of our approach are illustrated in numerical examples and experiments and by comparing it to existing decomposition approaches. In contrast to existing approaches, our new approach is not limited in the number of interaction points and incorporates only individual interaction forces which are physically plausible."
icra,None,Stable simulation of underactuated compliant hands,"Alessio Rocchi,Barrett Ames,Zhi Li,Kris Hauser,","Despite increasing popularity of compliant and underactuated hands, few tools are available for modeling them. Thus, we propose a simulation technique to predict the success of a compliant gripper grasping irregular objects, which could be used in mechanism design as well as grasp planning. The simulator we propose integrates joint compliance simulation with a Boundary Layer Expanded Mesh (BLEM) technique to enhance the stability of contact estimation. We compare the proposed simulator with existing simulators via a set of stability and fidelity criteria, including contact force variation, contact position variation, and contact normal variation. Scores along these criteria are correlated with the simulator's accuracy of predicting the success/failure of a given grasp pose and preshape. A test set of 13 grasps, with two compliant underactuated hands were manually generated on 4 objects. Experiments suggest that our simulator leads to improvements in the stability criteria, predictability of grasp success, and reduction of simulation artifacts."

SRAs are gaining increasing popularity compared to traditional actuators, such as dc motors and hydraulic or pneumatic pistons, due to their inherent compliance, low morphological complexity, high power-to-weight ratio, resilience to external shocks and adverse environmental conditions, design flexibility, ease of fabrication, and low costs. We present the design, modelling and experimental characterisation of SoRo-Track. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of SoRo-Track for solar tracking applications, which makes it a viable component for dynamic building facades."
icra,None,Auxetic metamaterial simplifies soft robot design,"Andrew G. Mark,Stefano Palagi,Tian Qiu,Peer Fischer,","Soft materials are being adopted in robotics in order to facilitate biomedical applications and in order to achieve simpler and more capable robots. One route to simplification is to design the robot's body using `smart materials' that carry the burden of control and actuation. Metamaterials enable just such rational design of the material properties. Here we present a soft robot that exploits mechanical metamaterials for the intrinsic synchronization of two passive clutches which contact its travel surface. Doing so allows it to move through an enclosed passage with an inchworm motion propelled by a single actuator. Our soft robot consists of two 3D-printed metamaterials that implement auxetic and normal elastic properties. The design, fabrication and characterization of the metamaterials are described. In addition, a working soft robot is presented. Since the synchronization mechanism is a feature of the robot's material body, we believe that the proposed design will enable compliant and robust implementations that scale well with miniaturization."

Walker,,,","The complexity of soft continuum manipulators with hybrid and tuneable structures poses a challenging task to achieve an inverse kinematics model which is both precise and computationally efficient for control and optimization purposes. In this paper, a new method based on the principle of virtual work and a geometry deformation approach is presented for the inverse kinematics model of the STIFF-FLOP arm which is a pneumatically actuated continuum manipulator. We propose a novel simplified and computationally efficient yet accurate analytical solution to analyse the static behaviour of a compound soft manipulator in the presence of external and body forces which is verified against experimental data, showing promising agreement with 10% mean error for planar movements. In the process, we present a new modelling approach for braided soft extensor actuators with no braid-surface relative slip constraint. For the first time, our model predicts a simple analytical solution for the cross section deformation which is essential to control soft manipulators with regional tunable stiffness structure."
icra,None,A composite soft bending actuation module with integrated curvature sensing,"Selim Ozel,Erik H. Skorina,Ming Luo,Weijia Tao,Fuchen Chen,,,","Soft robotics carries the promise of making robots as capable and adaptable as biological creatures, but this will not be possible without the ability to perform self-sensing and control with precision and repeatability. In this paper, we seek to address this need with the development of a new pneumatically-actuated soft bending actuation module with integrated curvature sensing. We designed and fabricated two different versions of this module: One with a commercially available resistive flex sensor and the other with a magnetic curvature sensor of our own design, and used an external motion capture system to calibrate and validate these two approaches. In addition, we used an iterative sliding mode controller to drive the modules through step curvature references to demonstrate the controllability of the modules as well as compare the usability of the two sensors. We found that the magnetic sensor returned noisy but accurate data, while the flex sensor had minor inaccuracies and it was subject to overshoot but did not exhibit notable noise. Experimental results show that this phenomenon of overshoot from the flex sensor causes active feedback control of the bending actuator to exhibit significant positioning errors. This work demonstrates that our soft bending actuator can be controlled with repeatability and precision, and that our magnetic curvature sensor represents an improvement for use in proprioception and closed-loop control of soft robotic devices."

These are self-folding origami modules that transform their shape from a cubic to a flat shape, and vice versa, similarly to a three-dimensional (3D) morphing pixel. By changing the shape of individual modules, the system can generate desired shapes. Each module is based on a modified Kresling pattern, which has bi-stability during deployment so that it can maintain its shape in both states without any actuator force. Also, it can rapidly and reversibly transform its shape via folding and unfolding motions that are generated by a low-profile torsional SMA wire actuator positioned at fold lines. This approach is a hybrid of the modular and folding approaches so that the system can generate shape-shifting without complicated communication methodology between modules and bulky infrastructure, and has fast, compact and lightweight hardware. We demonstrate performance with a 3×3 matrix form of this module (40 mm side length) that can make five different shapes and it required only 15 seconds per transformation. This new shape-shifting system could be applied to design multi-functional self-folding origami such as a morphing 3D map."
icra,None,Printable skin adhesive stretch sensor for measuring multi-axis human joint angles,"Hyosang Lee,Jiseung Cho,Jung Kim,","This paper presents a printable skin adhesive stretch sensor to estimate rotation angles of multi-axis joint for biomedical engineering applications, such as gait analysis, gesture recognition, and motion monitoring. Silicone rubber mixed with multiwall carbon nanotube composites were fabricated to make a highly stretchable (up to 120%) strain sensors. Embedding liquid state composites to the fabric leaded to enhance the adhesive force between the composites and fabric. The skin adhesive sensor system could be used to estimate rotation angles of the multi-axis joints while providing comfortable physical interfaces. To reduce misalignment to the axis of rotation, a calibration method was formulated based on geometrical relationship between the sensor axes and the joint angle. In order to validate the estimation performance of the sensor in multi-axis joint, shoulder flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles were estimated. The results showed the system could estimate the rotation angles of the shoulder enough to identify motion intentions of the user. In the future, the proposed system can be applied to the motion monitoring system by direct attachment to skin without discomfort to the user in daily life."
icra,None,Motion control of a soft-actuated modular manipulator,"Erik H. Skorina,Weijia Tao,Fuchen Chen,Ming Luo,Cagdas D. Onal,","Soft pneumatic actuators can allow robotic manipulators to interact safely in complex environments in close proximity to humans, but work still needs to be done controlling them more effectively. We explore this area by introducing a 2-degree of freedom (DoF) universal joint module actuated by three reverse Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (rPAMs) and an associated geometric Jacobian-enhanced iterative sliding mode controller. After demonstrating the effectiveness of this controller, we combine two of these modules to form a 4-DoF soft actuated manipulator. To control this modular manipulation system, we propose two controllers: a direct inverse kinematic (IK) controller and an end-effector geometric Jacobian controller. Though both controllers were validated to function effectively, the Jacobian controller was more precise (especially under payload) while the IK controller was more accurate."
icra,None,"Improving Soft Pneumatic Actuator fingers through integration of soft sensors, position and force control, and rigid fingernails","John Morrow,Hee-Sup Shin,Calder Phillips-Grafflin,Sung-Hwan Jang,,,,,,","Soft Pneumatic Actuators (SPAs) have recently become popular for use as fingers in robotic hands because of their inherent compliance, low cost, and ease of construction. We seek to overcome two key limitations which limit SPAs' abilities to grasp and manipulate objects: 1) Current SPAs lack position or force sensor feedback, which prevents controlling them precisely (e.g. to achieve a hand preshape or apply a specified pushing force), and 2) the tip of the SPA is compliant and has high friction against common surfaces, causing the SPA to stick against surfaces when grasping objects from above. To overcome the first limitation we propose methods to integrate soft eGaIn sensors into SPAs and controllers that use these sensors' feedback for position and force control. To overcome the second limitation, we explore embedding rigid fingernails into the tip of the SPA so that the finger does not stick against surfaces and can wedge under objects. Our experiments suggest that we can achieve low steady-state error and overshoot in position and force using feed-forward models that relate pressure, force, and curvature along with a PID controller. We also compare several fingernail designs and show that the best-performing design significantly outperforms having no fingernails when grasping a set of common objects from a table."
icra,None,Cross-modal adaptation for RGB-D detection,"Judy Hoffman,Saurabh Gupta,Jian Leong,Sergio Guadarrama,Trevor Darrell,",In this paper we propose a technique to adapt convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detectors trained on RGB images to effectively leverage depth images at test time to boost detection performance. Given labeled depth images for a handful of categories we adapt an RGB object detector for a new category such that it can now use depth images in addition to RGB images at test time to produce more accurate detections. Our approach is built upon the observation that lower layers of a CNN are largely task and category agnostic and domain specific while higher layers are largely task and category specific while being domain agnostic. We operationalize this observation by proposing a mid-level fusion of RGB and depth CNNs. Experimental evaluation on the challenging NYUD2 dataset shows that our proposed adaptation technique results in an average 21% relative improvement in detection performance over an RGB-only baseline even when no depth training data is available for the particular category evaluated. We believe our proposed technique will extend advances made in computer vision to RGB-D data leading to improvements in performance at little additional annotation effort.
icra,None,Learning anisotropic ICP (LA-ICP) for robust and efficient 3D registration,"Bhoram Lee,Daniel D. Lee,","This paper presents an online learning approach to 3D object registration that vastly improves the performance of Iterative Closest Point (ICP) methods. Our approach achieves better robustness and stable convergence by learning generalized distance functions directly from a stream of object depth data. The proposed algorithm, Learning Anisotropic ICP (LA-ICP), parameterizes the point uncertainty of the underlying object surface as an anisotropic Gaussian, and estimates the covariance parameters of the likelihood function for ICP from data. Our learning scheme does not require manual tuning and the parameters of the algorithm are continually updated from observed data. Experiments on various RGB-D object datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of convergence and pose accuracy as well as robustness to initial conditions."
icra,None,3D point cloud segmentation using topological persistence,"William J. Beksi,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","In this paper, we present an approach to segment 3D point cloud data using ideas from persistent homology theory. The proposed algorithms first generate a simplicial complex representation of the point cloud dataset. Next, we compute the zeroth homology group of the complex which corresponds to the number of connected components. Finally, we extract the clusters of each connected component in the dataset. We show that this technique has several advantages over state of the art methods such as the ability to provide a stable segmentation of point cloud data under noisy or poor sampling conditions and its independence of a fixed distance metric."
icra,None,PERCH: Perception via search for multi-object recognition and localization,"Venkatraman Narayanan,Maxim Likhachev,","In many robotic domains such as flexible automated manufacturing or personal assistance, a fundamental perception task is that of identifying and localizing objects whose 3D models are known. Canonical approaches to this problem include discriminative methods that find correspondences between feature descriptors computed over the model and observed data. While these methods have been employed successfully, they can be unreliable when the feature descriptors fail to capture variations in observed data; a classic cause being occlusion. As a step towards deliberative reasoning, we present PERCH: PErception via SeaRCH, an algorithm that seeks to find the best explanation of the observed sensor data by hypothesizing possible scenes in a generative fashion. Our contributions are: i) formulating the multi-object recognition and localization task as an optimization problem over the space of hypothesized scenes, ii) exploiting structure in the optimization to cast it as a combinatorial search problem on what we call the Monotone Scene Generation Tree, and iii) leveraging parallelization and recent advances in multi-heuristic search in making combinatorial search tractable. We prove that our system can guaranteedly produce the best explanation of the scene under the chosen cost function, and validate our claims on real world RGB-D test data. Our experimental results show that we can identify and localize objects under heavy occlusion— cases where state-of-the-art methods struggle."
icra,None,Hierarchical semantic parsing for object pose estimation in densely cluttered scenes,"Chi Li,Jonathan Bohren,Eric Carlson,Gregory D. Hager,","Densely cluttered scenes are composed of multiple objects which are in close contact and heavily occlude each other. Few existing 3D object recognition systems are capable of accurately predicting object poses in such scenarios. This is mainly due to the presence of objects with textureless surfaces, similar appearances and the difficulty of object instance segmentation. In this paper, we present a hierarchical semantic segmentation algorithm which partitions a densely cluttered scene into different object regions. A RANSAC-based registration method is subsequently applied to estimate 6-DoF object poses within each object class. Part of this algorithm includes a generalized pooling scheme used to construct robust and discriminative object representations from a convolutional architecture with multiple pooling domains. We also provide a new RGB-D dataset which serves as a benchmark for object pose estimation in densely cluttered scenes. This dataset contains five thousand scene frames and over twenty thousand labeled poses of ten common hand tools. We show that our method demonstrates improved performance of pose estimation on this new dataset compared with other state-of-the-art methods."
icra,None,Structure-based auto-calibration of RGB-D sensors,"Bernhard Zeisl,Marc Pollefeys,","The readily available image and depth data from commodity RGB-D sensors has had tremendous impact in the robotics and computer vision community recently. To jointly leverage both modalities, the depth and image measurements need to be registered. Typical calibration approaches make use of artificial landmarks and special calibration targets. However, this is not feasible if on-line (re-)calibration is necessary or the sensor setup is inaccessible, e.g., for already captured datasets. Instead of using specific calibration patterns, we propose to leverage a sparse environment model as geometric prior for the calibration. Structure-from-motion or SLAM can provide such a sparse 3D scene model, and hence our approach allows for self-calibration without the need for any manual interaction. We validate our hypothesis by introducing an optimization that jointly minimizes the alignment error between the sparse map and all recorded depth maps. Since the accuracy of depth measurements is known to degrade considerably with scene depth, we account for this distortion via a spatially varying correction term. The evaluation of our approach demonstrates that we are able to compute an accurate extrinsic and intrinsic calibration, which for example allows dense 3D modeling at improved precision."
icra,None,An integrated approach to visual perception of articulated objects,"Roberto Martín-Martín,Sebastian Höfer,Oliver Brock,","We present an integrated approach for perception of unknown articulated objects. To robustly perceive objects and understand interactions, our method tightly integrates pose tracking, shape reconstruction, and the estimation of their kinematic structure. The key insight of our method is that these sub-problems complement each other: for example, tracking is greatly facilitated by knowing the shape of the object, whereas the shape and the kinematic structure can be more easily reconstructed if the motion of the object is known. Our combined method leverages these synergies to improve the performance of perception. We analyze the proposed method in average cases and difficult scenarios using a variety of rigid and articulated objects. The results show that our integrated solution achieves better results than solutions for the individual problems. This demonstrates the benefits of approaching robot perception problems in an integrated manner."
icra,None,Rolling shutter and motion blur removal for depth cameras,"Siddharth Tourani,Sudhanshu Mittal,Akhil Nagariya,Visesh Chari,,","Structured light range sensors (SLRS) like the Microsoft Kinect have electronic rolling shutters (ERS). The output of such a sensor while in motion is subject to significant motion blur (MB) and rolling shutter (RS) distortion. Most robotic literature still does not explicitly model this distortion, resulting in inaccurate camera motion estimation. In RGBD cameras, we show via experimentation that the distortion undergone by depth images is different from that of color images and provide a mathematical model for it. We propose an algorithm that rectifies for these RS and MB distortions. To assess the performance of the algorithm we conduct an extensive set of experiments for each step of the pipeline. We assess the performance of our algorithm by comparing the performance of the rectified images on scene-flow and camera pose estimation, and show that with our proposed rectification, the performance improvement is significant."
icra,None,Plantation monitoring and yield estimation using autonomous quadcopter for precision agriculture,"Vishakh Duggal,Mohak Sukhwani,Kumar Bipin,G. Syamasundar Reddy,,","Recently, quadcopters with their advance sensors and imaging capabilities have become an imperative part of the precision agriculture. In this work, we have described a framework which performs plantation monitoring and yield estimation using the supervised learning approach, while autonomously navigating through an inter-row path of the plantation. The proposed navigation framework assists the quadcopter to follow a sequence of collision-free GPS way points and has been integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System). The trajectory planning and control module of the navigation framework employ convex programming techniques to generate minimum time trajectory between way-points and produces appropriate control inputs for the quadcopter. A new ‘pomegranate dataset’ comprising of plantation surveillance video and annotated frames capturing the varied stages of pomegranate growth along with the navigation framework are being delivered as a part of this work."
icra,None,Self-supervised weed detection in vegetable crops using ground based hyperspectral imaging,"Alexander Wendel,James Underwood,","A critical step in treating or eradicating weed infestations amongst vegetable crops is the ability to accurately and reliably discriminate weeds from crops. In recent times, high spatial resolution hyperspectral imaging data from ground based platforms have shown particular promise in this application. Using spectral vegetation signatures to discriminate between crop and weed species has been demonstrated on several occasions in the literature over the past 15 years. A number of authors demonstrated successful per-pixel classification with accuracies of over 80%. However, the vast majority of the related literature uses supervised methods, where training datasets have been manually compiled. In practice, static training data can be particularly susceptible to temporal variability due to physiological or environmental change. A self-supervised training method that leverages prior knowledge about seeding patterns in vegetable fields has recently been introduced in the context of RGB imaging, allowing the classifier to continually update weed appearance models as conditions change. This paper combines and extends these methods to provide a self-supervised framework for hyperspectral crop/weed discrimination with prior knowledge of seeding patterns using an autonomous mobile ground vehicle. Experimental results in corn crop rows demonstrate the system's performance and limitations."
icra,None,A novel framework for modeling dormant apple trees using single depth image for robotic pruning application,"Shayan A. Akbar,Noha M. Elfiky,Avinash Kak,","Dormant pruning is one of the most costly and labor-intensive operations in specialty crop production. During winter, a large crew of trained seasonal workers has to carefully remove the branches from hundreds of trees using a set of pre-defined rules. The goal of automatic pruning is to reduce this dependence on a large work-force that is currently needed for the job. Automatically applying the pruning rules entails construction of 3D models of the trees in their dormant condition (that is, without foliage) and accurate estimation of the pruning points on the branches. This paper investigates the contribution of modeling the trunk and primary branches of a tree using semi-circles in a 3D reconstruction scheme. It involves three main steps; estimating the diameter-error, filtering the depth images, and semi-circle-based modeling which estimates the required pruning data. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for automatic reconstruction using only single depth image. We further propose a novel empirical model that estimates the diameter of the primary branches under varying depth values. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed on a new challenging apple trees dataset under various indoor and outdoor environments. Our results show that the proposed scheme provides a performance of 89% for correctly estimating the diameter of the primary branches."
icra,None,Towards autonomous phytopathology: Outcomes and challenges of citrus greening disease detection through close-range remote sensing,"Suproteem K. Sarkar,Jnaneshwar Das,Reza Ehsani,Vijay Kumar,","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to significantly impact early detection and monitoring of plant diseases. In this paper, we present preliminary work in developing a UAV-mounted sensor suite for detection of citrus greening disease, a major threat to Florida citrus production. We propose a depth-invariant sensing methodology for measuring reflectance of polarized amber light, a metric which has been found to measure starch accumulation in greening-infected leaves. We describe the implications of adding depth information to this method, including the use of machine learning models to discriminate between healthy and infected leaves with validation accuracies up to 93%. Additionally, we discuss stipulations and challenges of use of the system with UAV platforms. This sensing system has the potential to allow for rapid scanning of groves to determine the spread of the disease, especially in areas where infection is still in early stages, including citrus farms in California. Although presented in the context of citrus greening disease, the methods can be applied to a variety of plant pathology studies, enabling timely monitoring of plant health-impacting scientists, growers, and policymakers."
icra,None,An effective classification system for separating sugar beets and weeds for precision farming applications,"P. Lottes,M. Hoeferlin,S. Sander,M. Müter,P. Schulze,Lammers C. Stachniss,","Robots for precision farming have the potential to reduce the reliance on herbicides and pesticides through selectively spraying individual plants or through manual weed removal. To achieve this, the value crops and the weeds must be identified by the robot's perception system to trigger the actuators for spraying or removal. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting the sugar beet plants as well as weeds using a camera installed on a mobile robot operating on a field. We propose a system that performs vegetation detection, feature extraction, random forest classification, and smoothing through a Markov random field to obtain an accurate estimate of the crops and weeds. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our system on a real farm robot on different sugar beet fields and illustrate that our approach allows for accurately identifying the weed on the field."
icra,None,Image classification with orchard metadata,"Suchet Bargoti,James Underwood,","Low cost and easy to use monocular vision systems are able to capture large scale, dense data in orchards, to facilitate precision agriculture applications. Accurate image parsing is required for this purpose, however, operating in natural outdoor conditions makes this a complex task due to the undesirable intra-class variations caused by changes in illumination, pose and tree types, etc. Typically these variations are difficult to explicitly model and discriminative classifiers strive to be invariant to them. However, given the presence of structure, in both the orchard and how the data was obtained, a subset of these factors of variations can correlate with readily available metadata, including extrinsic experimental information such as the sun incidence angle, position within farm, etc. This paper presents a method to incorporate such metadata to aid scene parsing based on a multi-scale Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) architecture. Experimental results are shown for pixel segmentation over data collected at an apple orchard, leading to fruit detection and yield estimation. The results show a consistent improvement in segmentation accuracy with the inclusion of metadata under different network complexities, training configurations and evaluation metrics."
icra,None,Texture-based fruit detection via images using the smooth patterns on the fruit,"Zania S Pothen,Stephen Nuske,","This paper describes a keypoint detection algorithm to accurately detect round fruits in high resolution imagery. The significant challenge associated with round fruits such as grapes and apples is that the surface is smooth and lacks definition and contrasting features, the contours of the fruit may be partially occluded, and the color of the fruit often blends with background foliage. We propose a fruit detection algorithm that utilizes the gradual variation of intensity and gradient orientation on the surface of the fruit. Candidate fruit locations, or “seed points” are tested for both monotonically decreasing intensity and gradient orientation profiles. Candidate fruit locations that pass the initial filter are classified using modified histogram of oriented gradients combined with a pairwise intensity comparison texture descriptor and random forest classifier. We analyse the performance of the fruit detection algorithm on image datasets of grapes and apples using human labeled images as ground truth. Our method to detect candidate fruit locations is scale invariant, robust to partial occlusions and more accurate than existing methods. We achieve overall F1 accuracy score of 0.82 for grapes and 0.80 for apples. We demonstrate our method is more accurate than existing methods."
icra,None,"Discrete switching commands for tracking and vibration suppression using a quantized, compliant camera orientation system","Michael Duckjune Kim,Jun Ueda,","This paper presents a method to generate discrete switching commands for a camera orientation system exhibiting quantization and flexibility to achieve smooth-pursuit like movements. Existing vibration suppression techniques and camera positioning devices have shown notable results but focused only on point-to-point movements. A desired motion profile can be generated by incorporating a classical feedback controller with PWM quantization but each unit actuator is required to produce high-frequency switching that can potentially damage the complaint mechanism. The proposed controller generates pulse-like switching commands for smooth-pursuit like motion to match the velocity of an object of interest. Then, switching commands for vibration suppression are generated to avoid high-frequency switching. The proposed method has been evaluated by using a robotic system which has a total of 32 piezoelectric actuator. The experiment results show that the camera orientation system successfully achieved dynamic vision given the proposed commands in an open-loop manner."
icra,None,A near-optimal dynamic power sharing scheme for self-reconfigurable modular robots,"Chi-An Chen,Thomas Collins,Wei-Min Shen,",This paper proposes a dynamic and near-optimal power sharing mechanism for self-reconfigurable modular robots that successfully extends the operating time of sets of connected modules. The proposed method achieves near-optimal results even when each module only knows the power status of its immediate neighbors (those to which it is directly connected) rather than the power status of every module in the robotic system. The proposed method is validated in physics-based simulation environments and will be implemented on real robotic hardware developed at the Polymorphic Robotics Laboratory at the University of Southern California. It is also compared with current state-of-the-art power sharing mechanisms. Simulated results show that the proposed method allows for longer operation time than with alternative state-of-the-art methods.
icra,None,Modular Hydraulic Propulsion: A robot that moves by routing fluid through itself,"Matthew J. Doyle,Xinyu Xu,Yue Gu,Fernando Perez-Diaz,Christopher Parrott,,","This paper introduces the concept of Modular Hydraulic Propulsion, in which a modular robot that operates in a fluid environment moves by routing the fluid through itself. The robot's modules represent sections of a hydraulics network. Each module can move fluid between any of its faces. The modules (network sections) can be rearranged into arbitrary topologies. We propose a decentralized motion controller, which does not require modules to communicate, compute, nor store information during run-time. We use 3-D simulations to compare the performance of this controller to that of a centralized controller with full knowledge of the task. We also detail the design and fabrication of six 2-D prototype modules, which float in a water tank. Results of systematic experiments show that the decentralized controller, despite its simplicity, reliably steers modular robots towards a light source. Modular Hydraulic Propulsion could offer new solutions to problems requiring reconfigurable systems to move precisely in 3-D, such as inspection of pipes, vascular systems or other confined spaces."
icra,None,A new meta-module for efficient reconfiguration of hinged-units modular robots,"Irene Parada,Vera Sacristán,Rodrigo I. Silveira,","We present a robust and compact meta-module for edge-hinged modular robot units such as M-TRAN, SuperBot, SMORES, UBot, PolyBot and CKBot, as well as for central-point-hinged ones such as Molecubes and Roombots. Thanks to the rotational degrees of freedom of these units, the novel meta-module is able to expand and contract, as to double/halve its length in each dimension. Moreover, for a large class of edge-hinged robots the proposed meta-module also performs the scrunch/relax and transfer operations required by any tunneling-based reconfiguration strategy, such as those designed for Crystalline and Telecube robots. These results make it possible to apply efficient geometric reconfiguration algorithms to this type of robots. We prove the size of this new meta-module to be optimal. Its robustness and performance substantially improve over previous results."
icra,None,A task-driven algorithm for configuration synthesis of modular robots,"Esra Icer,Andrea Giusti,Matthias Althoff,","This paper presents a time-efficient, task-based configuration synthesis algorithm for modular robot manipulators. One of the main challenges in modular manipulators is to find possible combinations of modules that are able to complete given tasks while avoiding obstacles in the environment. Most studies on modular robots focus on obtaining combinations of modules to achieve a given task without considering the required path planning in an environment with obstacles. In contrast to previous works, we present a configuration synthesis method for modular manipulators, considering collision detection and path planning in task space. Our simulations show that our approach finds possible combinations with reduced computational time compared to previous techniques."
icra,None,Design of manually reconfigurable modular manipulator with three revolute joints and links,"Seonghun Hong,Dongeun Choi,Sungchul Kang,Hyeongcheol Lee,,","Anthropomorphic arm manipulators usually consist of as a series of revolute joints and links. In this paper, serial-chain manipulators are described by a novel kinematic representation using a series of type R or T joints, which are classified according to relation between a rotational axis and two adjacent links. It provides an easy intuition to describe general types among existing manipulators and also to get intuitive ideas before designing of joint and link modules of modular manipulators. From these intuitive idea about joint configurations using two types of joints, a new concept of joint module with two input and one output connections is presented. This joint module enables to couple directly between two joint modules. In addition, practical solutions of mechanical and electrical connections between joint or link modules is introduced. The connection can be established between two modules via eight types of relative positions of 45 degree intervals. Using joint and link modules, 3-DoF(Degrees-of-Freedom) modular manipulators of three kinds of joint configurations are shown representatively. After assembly, the standard D-H(Denavit-Hartenberg) parameters of three examples are obtained utilizing information of joint and link modules."
icra,None,Simultaneous configuration formation and information collection by modular robotic systems,"Ayan Dutta,Prithviraj Dasgupta,","We consider the configuration formation problem in modular robotic systems where a set of singleton modules that are spatially distributed in an environment are required to assume appropriate positions so that they can configure into a new, user-specified target configuration, while simultaneously maximizing the amount of information collected while navigating from their initial to final positions. Each module has a limited energy budget to expend while moving from its initial to goal location. To solve this problem, we propose a budget-limited, heuristic search-based algorithm that finds a path that maximizes the entropy of the expected information along the path. We have analytically proved that our proposed approach converges within finite time. Experimental results show that our planning approach has lower run-time than an auction-based allocation algorithm for selecting modules' spots."
icra,None,Full-resolution reconfiguration planning for heterogeneous cube-shaped modular robots with only sliding motion primitive,"Hiroshi Kawano,","This paper presents a full-resolution reconfiguration algorithm for a heterogeneous modular robot composed of sliding cube modules with a limited motion primitive. We assume that a cube module is not allowed to make convex motions around other modules but is allowed to slide across other modules' surfaces. The availability of reconfiguration algorithm for such a module with limited mobility overcomes restrictions in the design of modular robots. To overcome the limited mobility of the assumed cube module, we introduce a method that compresses a robot with virtual walls and executes a reconfiguration and heterogeneous permutation of the robot structure in the compressed configuration. We prove the correctness and completeness of the proposed algorithm for three-dimensional connected structures. Simulation results show that the reconfiguration in free space is executed in quadratic operating time cost."
icra,None,Steering micro-robotic swarm by dynamic actuating fields,"Qianwen Chao,Jiangfan Yu,Chengkai Dai,Tiantian Xu,Li Zhang,,,","We present a general solution for steering microrobotic swarm by dynamic actuating fields. In our approach, the motion of micro-robots is controlled by changing the actuating direction of a field applied to them. The time-series sequence of actuating field's directions can be computed automatically. Given a target position in the domain of swarm, a governing field is first constructed to provide optimal moving directions at every points. Following these directions, a robot can be driven to the target efficiently. However, when working with a crowd of micro-robots, the optimal moving directions on different agents can contradict with each other. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a novel steering algorithm to compute a statistically optimal actuating direction at each time frame. Following a sequence of these actuating directions, a crowd of micro-robots can be transported to the target region effectively. Our steering strategy of swarm has been verified on a platform that generates magnetic fields with unique actuating directions. Experimental tests taken on aggregated magnetic micro-particles are quite encouraging."
icra,None,Robot-assisted optical trapping and manipulation of a biological cell with stochastic perturbations,"Xiang Li,Xiao Yan,Chien Chern Cheah,","Several control schemes have been proposed for optical tweezers, but most existing methods assume that the optical trapping is maintained throughout the manipulation, and Brownian motion is ignored for the simplification of stability analysis. However, the optical trapping is not effective when a biological cell is initially outside the optical trap, and even if the cell is initially trapped, it may escape from the optical trap due to random Brownian perturbations and kinetic energy gained during manipulation. This paper presents a new robotic control technique to address the trapping and manipulation problem of biological cell in presence of random Brownian perturbations. By using the proposed method, the cell can be automatically trapped when it is not inside the optical trap and the optical manipulation of cell is enhanced by saturating the position feedback. The stability of the closed-loop system is analysed from stochastic perspectives. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control method."

Moreover, each agent has a local high-level task given as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula of desired motion and actions. Embedded graph grammars (EGGs) are used as the main tool to specify local interaction rules and switching control modes among the robots, which is then combined with the model-checking-based task planning module. It is ensured that all local tasks are satisfied while the dynamic constraints are obeyed at all time. The overall approach is demonstrated by simulation and experimental results."
icra,None,Distributed formation control of non-holonomic robots without a global reference frame,"Eduardo Montijano,Eric Cristofalo,Mac Schwager,Carlos Sagues,","In this paper we consider the problem of controlling a team of non-holonomic robots to reach a desired formation. The formation is described in terms of the desired relative positions and orientations the robots need to keep with respect to each other, and it is assumed that the robots do not have a common shared reference frame. In other words, the robots can use only on-board sensing to achieve the formation. We first consider a holonomic framework, using a well known distance-based approach to reach a formation for the positions. We then include a control law for the orientations. We further discuss the problem of mirror configurations that appear when different desired relative orientations can satisfy the same distance-based constraints through different formations. Exploiting the concept of chirality, we present a relabeling strategy to reassign the robots' roles to reach the desired pattern when a mirror configuration occurs. The distance-based holonomic control is then transformed to cope with the non-holonomic constraints using a piecewise-smooth function. Simulation results, as well as hardware experiments with five m3pi robots demonstrate the applicability of our approach."

A heterogeneous group of robots is considered: a few independent robots are used as a control input for the system, with the aim of controlling the position of the remaining robots, namely the dependent ones. The control strategy presented in this paper explicitly considers changes in the communication topology among the robots. These changes happen as the system evolves, since robots are equipped with finite range communication devices."

Christensen,,","We propose a distributed algorithm to estimate the 3D trajectories of multiple cooperative robots from relative pose measurements. Our approach leverages recent results [1] which show that the maximum likelihood trajectory is well approximated by a sequence of two quadratic subproblems. The main contribution of the present work is to show that these subproblems can be solved in a distributed manner, using the distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm. Our approach has several advantages. It requires minimal information exchange, which is beneficial in presence of communication and privacy constraints. It has an anytime flavor: after few iterations the trajectory estimates are already accurate, and they asymptotically convergence to the centralized estimate. The DGS approach scales well to large teams, and it has a straightforward implementation. We test the approach in simulations and field tests, demonstrating its advantages over related techniques."
icra,None,Hybrid architecture for communication-aware multi-robot systems,"James Stephan,Jonathan Fink,Vijay Kumar,Alejandro Ribeiro,","In this paper we propose a hybrid architecture that allows a team of mobile robots to self-organize into a multi-hop ad-hoc network and solve the joint mobility and communication problem in complex environments to complete a given task. The system consists of an outer global planning loop and an inner local loop responsible for motion and network routing, arranged in a two-stage feedback system. This system is able to leverage the benefits of previous systems, while avoiding their drawbacks. This results in a lightweight responsive system that is able to operate in complex environments with minimal global coordination while maintaining a minimum end-to-end data rate between robots. Two main benefits of our approach are demonstrated through experimentation superior performance over existing systems and dynamic adjustment to unexpected events. We conclude with a demonstration of the system operating in a realistic scenario, in which the team patrols a set of hallways."
icra,None,Low latency bounty hunting and geographically adjacent server configuration for real-time cloud control,"Daniel M. Lofaro,Arvin Asokan,","This paper explores the feasibility and proposes a method on how to obtain high frequency real-time controllers operating in loop with physical robot hardware over a geographically adjacent and bounty hunting cloud server architecture. Having the cloud in the loop has many purposes including increasing computation, decreasing “on robot” power usage, reducing overall robot weight etc. Today when robots use the cloud in loop it is typically for sharing information, high level planning, and other non-real-time tasks. All of the balancing and stability algorithms stay onboard the robot. What if we could run high frequency real-time loops over the cloud? The better question is how would we do that? As with any real-time system latency is a big factor in the application and operation frequency. This paper shows that with a geographically adjacent and bounty hunting server approach it is feasible to obtain high frequency real-time control in loop with with a physical robot over the cloud. The feasibility of such a system running in-loop on humanoids and wheeled robots are explored and tested."
icra,None,Adaptive forward error correction with adjustable-latency QoS for robotic networks,"Ryan J. Marcotte,Edwin Olson,","Mobile robotic teams require robust communication in order to coordinate effectively, which is a challenge given the dynamic, unpredictable nature of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). These networks are subject to rapidly varying link qualities as robots move through their environment. Improving the robustness of these point-to-point links leads to greater overall network performance, which in turn allows the robots to perform their mission more effectively. In this work, we present a forward error correction (FEC) technique that exploits latency tolerance in network traffic to provide consistent packet delivery performance even on low-quality links. Our proposed system estimates link quality based on recent packet reception history and uses that estimate to determine FEC encoding strength. Furthermore, this system provides a novel Quality of Service (QoS) mechanism that trades latency tolerance for more reliable, lower overhead transmission. We evaluate the effectiveness of this technique in a real-world robotic testbed."
icra,None,Dynamic perimeter surveillance with a team of robots,"David Saldaña,Reza Javanmard Alitappeh,Luciano C. A. Pimenta,,,","In this paper, we propose a motion planning method to escort a set of agents from one place to a goal in an environment with obstacles. The agents are distributed in a finite area, with a time-varying perimeter, in which we put multiple robots to patrol around it with a desired velocity. Our proposal is composed of two parts. The first one generates a plan to move and deform the perimeter smoothly, and as a result, we obtain a twice differentiable boundary function. The second part uses the boundary function to compute a trajectory for each robot, we obtain each resultant trajectory by first solving a differential equation. After receiving the boundary function, the robots do not need to communicate among themselves until they finish their trajectories. We validate our proposal with simulations and experiments with actual robots."
icra,None,Environmental field estimation with hybrid-mobility sensor networks,"William C. Evans,Duarte Dias,Steven Roelofsen,Alcherio Martinoli,","The remarkable accessibility of modern flying robots makes them an attractive platform for environmental sensing. However, low cost and ease of use are currently incompatible with large payloads, severely limiting the choice of sensor and ultimately modality. This paper describes the design of a system for using a small infrared thermometer to estimate the surface temperature over an area that is large compared to the area measured by the sensor, by mounting it on a flying robot. We leverage a priori knowledge about the spatial statistics of the phenomena under measure in order to plan an informative sampling path, fusing observations by Gaussian process regression. Our approach is designed to be evaluated in an indoor testbed, in which a quadrotor, in cooperation with simulated static sensing nodes, estimates the spatial distribution of surface temperature over a controlled thermal gradient. We perform extensive systematic experimentation both in simulation and our real-world testbed environment, with our algorithm estimating surface temperature to an accuracy of up to 2.1 °C over a 16 m2 area ranging in value from 25-65 °C."
icra,None,Developing robotic swarms for ocean surface mapping,"Magnus Delight,Sankaran Ramakrishnan,Thomas Zambrano,Tyler MacCready,","In this paper we describe a model for achieving collective motion in a swarm of robotic boats with the purpose of ocean surface mapping. We also present the implementation and experimental validation of the concept through sea trials with 16-24 robotic boats. The model uses only local neighbor-neighbor interaction and reacts to external information measured in an environmental property or internal information possessed by a leader. We model and demonstrate three kinds of the behaviors: size-tunable mapping, environment-responsive migration, and leader-responsive migration. We also present experimental results from field trials carried out in Catalina Harbor, Santa Catalina Island, California."
icra,None,Distributed planar manipulation in fluidic environments,"Guillaume Sartoretti,Samuel Shaw,M. Ani Hsieh,","We present a distributed control strategy that enables a swarm of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to cooperatively grasp and manipulate a large floating object from an initial position and orientation to a desired final position and orientation. Given an initial set of random robot positions, our control strategy enables the team to synchronize their arrival times around the object. Analytical motion trajectories are then computed to enable the swarm to transport the object to the final desired position. We validate the proposed strategy in simulation and present experimental results to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy."
icra,None,Classifying swarm behavior via compressive subspace learning,"Matthew Berger,Lee M. Seversky,Daniel S. Brown,","Bio-inspired robot swarms encompass a rich space of dynamics and collective behaviors. Given some agent measurements of a swarm at a particular time instance, an important problem is the classification of the swarm behavior. This is challenging in practical scenarios where information from only a small number of agents may be available, resulting in limited agent samples for classification. Another challenge is recognizing emerging behavior: the prediction of swarm behavior prior to convergence of the attracting state. In this paper we address these challenges by modeling a swarm's collective motion as a low-dimensional linear subspace. We illustrate that for both synthetic and real data, these behaviors manifest as low-dimensional subspaces, and that these subspaces are highly discriminative. We also show that these subspaces generalize well to predicting emerging behavior, highlighting that there exists low-dimensional structure in transient agent behavior. In order to learn distinct behavior subspaces, we extend previous work on subspace estimation and identification from missing data to that of compressive measurements, where compressive measurements arise due to agent positions scattered throughout the domain. We demonstrate improvement in performance over prior works with respect to limited agent samples over a wide range of agent models and scenarios."
icra,None,Using abstraction for swarm control of a parent system,"Kyle L. Crandall,Caleb Whitehead,Shuqi Dong,Adam Wickenheiser,","Swarms of robots have many uses, from exploring an area in a parallel manner to manipulating objects, both on the ground and in the air. In this paper, we consider a class of swarms in which robots within the swarm work together to manipulate a parent system with its own dynamics. Using the process of abstraction, we find a set of variables that represent key elements of the swarm such as its mean position, the variance of the swarm's distribution, etc. Using these variables, we can generate a simplified model of how the swarm interacts with the parent system and design a controller to control the parent system through this abstract state. We show that we are able to use a swarm to regulate the parent system, track a step input, and reject step disturbances in an example problem involving a swarm of robots balancing a plane that is allowed to rotate about an axis through its center."
icra,None,Discrete-time distributed state feedback control for multi-robot systems,"Alessandro Marino,Francesco Pierri,","In this paper, a general framework to control in a distributed way a system composed by multiple robots is proposed. Each robot is characterized by a discrete-time linear dynamics, and the whole system is controlled via a linear static feedback law with a feed-forward term. Usually, this form of the global control input requires a central unit or an all-to-all communication for computing the local control input of each robot. To counteract the lack of a central unit, each robot estimates, via a local observer, the overall state of the team, and such an estimate is used to compute its local control input as in the case a central unit was present. Two simulations case studies are provided in the framework of multi-robot optimal control and formation control."
icra,None,Distributed multi-robot formation control among obstacles: A geometric and optimization approach with consensus,"Javier Alonso-Mora,Eduardo Montijano,Mac Schwager,Daniela Rus,","This paper presents a distributed method for navigating a team of robots in formation in 2D and 3D environments with static and dynamic obstacles. The robots are assumed to have a reduced communication and visibility radius and share information with their neighbors. Via distributed consensus the robots compute (a) the convex hull of the robot positions and (b) the largest convex region within free space. The robots then compute, via sequential convex programming, the locally optimal parameters for the formation within this convex neighborhood of the robots. Reconfiguration is allowed, when required, by considering a set of target formations. The robots navigate towards the target collision-free formation with individual local planners that account for their dynamics. The approach is efficient and scalable with the number of robots and performs well in simulations with up to sixteen quadrotors."
icra,None,Formalizing the impact of diversity on performance in a heterogeneous swarm of robots,"Amanda Prorok,M. Ani Hsieh,Vijay Kumar,","We are interested in a principled study of the impact of diversity in heterogeneous large-scale distributed robotic systems. In order to evaluate the implications of heterogeneity on performance, we consider the concrete problem of distributing a large group of robots among a set of tasks that require specialized capabilities in order to be completed. We model the system of heterogeneous robots as a community of species, where each species (robot type) is defined by the traits (capabilities) that it owns. We develop a continuous model of the system at a macroscopic level, and formulate an optimization problem that produces an optimal set of transition rates for each species, so that the desired trait distribution is reached as quickly as possible. In order to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity, we propose a diversity metric that defines the notion of eigenspecies. We show that our metric correlates with performance: the higher the cardinality of the eigenspecies, the harder it becomes to optimize the system. Our approach is validated over multiple levels of abstraction, and real robot results confirm its validity on physical platforms."

We describe how we made the demonstrator of a EU project review openly available to the research community. Specifically, we recorded episodic memories with rich semantic annotations during a pizza preparation experiment in autonomous robot manipulation. Afterwards, we released them as an open knowledge base using the cloud- and web-based robot knowledge service OPENEASE. We discuss several ways on how this open data can be used to validate our experimental reports and to tackle novel challenging research problems."
icra,None,Probabilistic qualitative mapping for robots,"Jennifer Padgett,Mark Campbell,","A probabilistic qualitative relational mapping (PQRM) algorithm is developed to enable robots to robustly map environments using noisy sensor measurements. Qualitative state representations provide soft, relative map information which is robust to metrical errors. In this paper, probabilistic distributions over qualitative states are derived and an algorithm to update the map recursively is developed. Maps are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations for convergence and correctness. Validation tests are conducted on the New College dataset to evaluate map performance in realistic environments."
icra,None,Graph-based Cross Entropy method for solving multi-robot decentralized POMDPs,"Shayegan Omidshafiei,Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi,Christopher Amato,,,,","This paper introduces a probabilistic algorithm for multi-robot decision-making under uncertainty, which can be posed as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP). Dec-POMDPs are inherently synchronous decision-making frameworks which require significant computational resources to be solved, making them infeasible for many real-world robotics applications. The Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (Dec-POSMDP) was recently introduced as an extension of the Dec-POMDP that uses high-level macro-actions to allow large-scale, asynchronous decision-making. However, existing Dec-POSMDP solution methods have limited scalability or perform poorly as the problem size grows. This paper proposes a cross-entropy based Dec-POSMDP algorithm motivated by the combinatorial optimization literature. The algorithm is applied to a constrained package delivery domain, where it significantly outperforms existing Dec-POSMDP solution methods."
icra,None,Searching for physical objects in partially known environments,"Xinkun Nie,Lawson L.S. Wong,Leslie Pack Kaelbling,","We address the problem of a mobile manipulation robot searching for an object in a cluttered domain that is populated with an unknown number of objects in an unknown arrangement. The robot must move around its environment, looking in containers, moving occluding objects to improve its view, and reasoning about collocation of objects of different types, all in service of finding a desired object. The key contribution in reasoning is a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for drawing samples of the arrangements of objects in an occluded container, conditioned on previous observations of other objects as well as spatial constraints. The key contribution in planning is a receding-horizon forward search in the space of distributions over arrangements (including number and type) of objects in the domain; to maintain tractability the search is formulated in a model that abstracts both the observations and actions available to the robot. The strategy is shown empirically to improve upon a baseline systematic search strategy, and sometimes outperforms a method from previous work."
icra,None,Safeguarding a lunar rover with Wald's sequential probability ratio test,"P. Michael Furlong,Michael Dille,Uland Wong,Ara Nefian,","The virtual bumper is a safeguarding mechanism for autonomous and remotely operated robots to conservatively avoid collisions even in the face of sensor uncertainty. In this paper we take a new approach to the virtual bumper system by applying a powerful but rarely examined statistical test. By using a modified version of Wald's sequential probability ratio test, we demonstrate that we can reduce the number of false positives reported by the virtual bumper, thereby saving valuable mission time. We further use the concept of sequential probability ratio to control vehicle speed in the presence of possible obstacles in order to increase certainty about whether or not obstacles are present. With this principled obstacle certainty measure, our new algorithm reduces the chances of collision by approximately 98% relative to traditional virtual bumper safeguarding without speed control."
icra,None,POMDP-lite for robust robot planning under uncertainty,"Min Chen,Emilio Frazzoli,David Hsu,Wee Sun Lee,","The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a principled general model for planning under uncertainty. However, solving a general POMDP is computationally intractable in the worst case. This paper introduces POMDP-lite, a subclass of POMDPs in which the hidden state variables are constant or only change deterministically. We show that a POMDP-lite is equivalent to a set of fully observable Markov decision processes indexed by a hidden parameter and is useful for modeling a variety of interesting robotic tasks. We develop a simple model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm to solve POMDP-lite models. The algorithm performs well on large-scale POMDP-lite models with up to 1020 states and outperforms the state-of-the-art general-purpose POMDP algorithms. We further show that the algorithm is near-Bayesian-optimal under suitable conditions."
icra,None,Neural networks and differential dynamic programming for reinforcement learning problems,"Akihiko Yamaguchi,Christopher G. Atkeson,","We explore a model-based approach to reinforcement learning where partially or totally unknown dynamics are learned and explicit planning is performed. We learn dynamics with neural networks, and plan behaviors with differential dynamic programming (DDP). In order to handle complicated dynamics, such as manipulating liquids (pouring), we consider temporally decomposed dynamics. We start from our recent work [1] where we used locally weighted regression (LWR) to model dynamics. The major contribution of this paper is making use of deep learning in the form of neural networks with stochastic DDP, and showing the advantages of neural networks over LWR. For this purpose, we extend neural networks for: (1) modeling prediction error and output noise, (2) computing an output probability distribution for a given input distribution, and (3) computing gradients of output expectation with respect to an input. Since neural networks have nonlinear activation functions, these extensions were not easy. We provide an analytic solution for these extensions using some simplifying assumptions. We verified this method in pouring simulation experiments. The learning performance with neural networks was better than that of LWR. The amount of spilled materials was reduced. We also present early results of robot experiments using a PR2. Accompanying video: https://youtu.be/aM3hE1J5W98."
icra,None,Autonomous drifting using simulation-aided reinforcement learning,"Mark Cutler,Jonathan P. How,","We introduce a framework that combines simple and complex continuous state-action simulators with a real-world robot to efficiently find good control policies, while minimizing the number of samples needed from the physical robot. The framework combines the strengths of various simulation levels by first finding optimal policies in a simple model, and then using that solution to initialize a gradient-based learner in a more complex simulation. The policy and transition dynamics from the complex simulation are in turn used to guide the learning in the physical world. A method is developed for transferring information gathered in the physical world back to the learning agent in the simulation. The new information is used to re-evaluate whether the original simulated policy is still optimal given the updated knowledge from the real-world. This reverse transfer is critical to minimizing samples from the physical world. The new framework is demonstrated on a robotic car learning to perform controlled drifting maneuvers. A video of the car's performance can be found at https: //youtu.be/opsmd5yuBF0."
icra,None,"From human instructions to robot actions: Formulation of goals, affordances and probabilistic planning","Alexandre Antunes,Lorenzo Jamone,Giovanni Saponaro,Alexandre Bernardino,,","This paper addresses the problem of having a robot executing motor tasks requested by a human through spoken language. Verbal instructions do not typically have a one-to-one mapping to robot actions, due to various reasons: economy of spoken language, e.g., one short instruction might indeed correspond to a complex sequence of robot actions, and details about action execution might be omitted; grounding, e.g., some actions might need to be added or adapted due to environmental contingencies; embodiment, e.g., a robot might have different means than the human ones to obtain the goals that the instruction refers to. We propose a general cognitive architecture to deal with these issues, based on three steps: i) language-based semantic reasoning on the instruction (high-level), ii) formulation of goals in robot symbols and probabilistic planning to achieve them (mid-level), iii) action execution (low-level). The description of the mid-level is the main focus of this paper. The robot plans are adapted to the current scenario, perceived in real-time and continuously updated, taking in consideration the robot capabilities, modeled through the concept of affordances: this allows for flexibility and creativity in the task execution. We showcase the performance of the proposed architecture with real world experiments using the iCub humanoid robot, also in the presence of unexpected events and action failures."
icra,None,Implicit belief-space pre-images for hierarchical planning and execution,"Leslie Pack Kaelbling,Tomás Lozano-Pérez,","We present a method for planning and execution in very high-dimensional mixed discrete and continuous spaces in the presence of uncertainty using an implicit, factored approximation representation of pre-images and extend it to planning in belief space. We demonstrate the approach in a mobile-manipulation domain combining pushing with pick-and-place manipulation with error in sensing and manipulation. We show empirically that execution monitoring using pre-images improves computational efficiency over continual replanning, and that the hierarchical planning method it enables provides further efficiency improvements."
icra,None,Aerial-ground robotic system for autonomous delivery tasks,"Barbara Arbanas,Antun Ivanovic,Marko Car,Tomislav Haus,Matko Orsag,,,","In this paper we present a study of a robotic system that consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a pair of manipulator arms (MMUAV), and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The envisioned application scenario includes autonomous packet transportation, where MMUAV is used for picking/placing packets, while both MMUAV and UGV can be used for packet transportation, with different energy consumption profiles. We propose a reactive method for decentralized task planning and coordination of robots using hierarchical task decomposition based on TÆMS framework. Our approach takes into account low-level motion-planning aspects of the system as well as high-level mission specification, making this a multi-layered system. For low-level planning we use sampling-based planner combined with obstacle-free trajectory generation. Methods are verified in simulations and on an experimental testbed, using 3D Robotics quadcopter and Pioneer 3DX mobile robots with the results showing stability and robustness of the presented methods."
icra,None,Autonomously constructing hierarchical task networks for planning and human-robot collaboration,"Bradley Hayes,Brian Scassellati,","Collaboration between humans and robots requires solutions to an array of challenging problems, including multi-agent planning, state estimation, and goal inference. There already exist feasible solutions for many of these challenges, but they depend upon having rich task models. In this work we detail a novel type of Hierarchical Task Network we call a Clique/Chain HTN (CC-HTN), alongside an algorithm for autonomously constructing them from topological properties derived from graphical task representations. As the presented method relies on the structure of the task itself, our work imposes no particular type of symbolic insight into motor primitives or environmental representation, making it applicable to a wide variety of use cases critical to human-robot interaction. We present evaluations within a multi-resolution goal inference task and a transfer learning application showing the utility of our approach."
icra,None,Assembly sequence planning for constructing planar structures with rectangular modules,"Jungwon Seo,Mark Yim,Vijay Kumar,","This paper addresses assembly sequence planning for constructing planar structures of the common brick wall pattern collectively with mobile modular robots that have the same rectangular footprint. Here we present a new algorithm for target structures with internal holes that our previous algorithm was not able to address. Our new algorithm constructs a feasible assembly sequence where robots do not have to pass through narrow corridors while approaching their target positions. The algorithm is provably correct and complete and runs in time that is linear in the size of a target structure, that is, the number of its parts. We also present software implementing our algorithms and a set of numerical experiments using the software. Finally, we extend our algorithms to address other symmetric patterns formed by a collection of congruent rectangles on the plane."
icra,None,Multi-objective planning with multiple high level task specifications,"Seyedshams Feyzabadi,Stefano Carpin,","We present an algorithm to solve a sequential stochastic decision making problem whereby a robot is subject to multiple objective functions and is asked to complete a number of subgoals specified using a subset of linear temporal logic. Each subgoal is associated with a desired satisfaction probability that will be met in expectation by the policy produced by the algorithm. Our method relies on the theory of constrained Markov Decision Processes and on methods coming from the realm of formal verification. The key idea is the definition of a product operation that can recursively incorporate more and more subgoals into the underlying planner. Ultimately, a policy is computed solving a linear program and we outline conditions for the existence and correctness of the solution. Our findings are validated in various simulation scenarios."
icra,None,Asynchronous multirobot exploration under recurrent connectivity constraints,"Jacopo Banfi,Alberto Quattrini Li,Nicola Basilico,Ioannis Rekleitis,,","In multirobot exploration under centralized control, communication plays an important role in constraining the team exploration strategy. Recurrent connectivity is a way to define communication constraints for which robots must connect to a base station only when making new observations. This paper studies effective multirobot exploration strategies under recurrent connectivity by considering a centralized and asynchronous planning framework. We formalize the problem of selecting the optimal set of locations robots should reach, provide an exact formulation to solve it, and devise an approximation algorithm to obtain efficient solutions with a bounded loss of optimality. Experiments in simulation and on real robots evaluate our approach in a number of settings."
icra,None,Analyzing the utility of a support pin in sequential robotic manipulation,"Chao Cao,Weiwei Wan,Jia Pan,Kensuke Harada,","Pick-and-place regrasp is an important manipulation skill for a robot. It helps a robot accomplish tasks that cannot be achieved within a single grasp, due to constraints such as kinematics or collisions between the robot and the environment. Previous work on pick-and-place regrasp only leveraged flat surfaces for intermediate placements, and thus is limited in the capability to reorient an object. In this paper, we extend the reorientation capability of a pick-and-place regrasp by adding a vertical pin on the working surface and using it as the intermediate location for regrasping. In particular, our method automatically computes the stable placements of an object leaning against a vertical pin, finds several force-closure grasps, generates a graph of regrasp actions, and searches for the regrasp sequence. To compare the regrasping performance with and without using pins, we evaluate the success rate and the length of regrasp sequences while performing tasks on various models. Experiments on reorientation and assembly tasks validate the benefit of using support pins for regrasping."
icra,None,Relational activity processes for modeling concurrent cooperation,"Marc Toussaint,Thibaut Munzer,Yoan Mollard,Li Yang Wu,Ngo Anh Vien,,","In human-robot collaboration, multi-agent domains, or single-robot manipulation with multiple end-effectors, the activities of the involved parties are naturally concurrent. Such domains are also naturally relational as they involve objects, multiple agents, and models should generalize over objects and agents. We propose a novel formalization of relational concurrent activity processes that allows us to transfer methods from standard relational MDPs, such as Monte-Carlo planning and learning from demonstration, to concurrent cooperation domains. We formally compare the formulation to previous propositional models of concurrent decision making and demonstrate planning and learning from demonstration methods on a real-world human-robot assembly task."
icra,None,On multi-modal people tracking from mobile platforms in very crowded and dynamic environments,"Timm Linder,Stefan Breuers,Bastian Leibe,Kai O. Arras,","Tracking people is a key technology for robots and intelligent systems in human environments. Many person detectors, filtering methods and data association algorithms for people tracking have been proposed in the past 15+ years in both the robotics and computer vision communities, achieving decent tracking performances from static and mobile platforms in real-world scenarios. However, little effort has been made to compare these methods, analyze their performance using different sensory modalities and study their impact on different performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a fully integrated real-time multi-modal laser/RGB-D people tracking framework for moving platforms in environments like a busy airport terminal. We conduct experiments on two challenging new datasets collected from a first-person perspective, one of them containing very dense crowds of people with up to 30 individuals within close range at the same time. We consider four different, recently proposed tracking methods and study their impact on seven different performance metrics, in both single and multi-modal settings. We extensively discuss our findings, which indicate that more complex data association methods may not always be the better choice, and derive possible future research directions."
icra,None,Real-time RGB-D based template matching pedestrian detection,"Omid Hosseini Jafari,Michael Ying Yang,","Pedestrian detection is one of the most popular topics in computer vision and robotics. Considering challenging issues in multiple pedestrian detection, we present a real-time depth-based template matching people detector. In this paper, we propose different approaches for training the depth-based template. We train multiple templates for handling issues due to various upper-body orientations of the pedestrians and different levels of detail in depth-map of the pedestrians with various distances from the camera. And, we take into account the degree of reliability for different regions of sliding window by proposing the weighted template approach. Furthermore, we combine the depth-detector with an appearance based detector as a verifier to take advantage of the appearance cues for dealing with the limitations of depth data. We evaluate our method on the challenging ETH dataset sequence. We show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."
icra,None,GLMP- realtime pedestrian path prediction using global and local movement patterns,"Aniket Bera,Sujeong Kim,Tanmay Randhavane,Srihari Pratapa,,","We present a novel real-time algorithm to predict the path of pedestrians in cluttered environments. Our approach makes no assumption about pedestrian motion or crowd density, and is useful for short-term as well as long-term prediction. We interactively learn the characteristics of pedestrian motion and movement patterns from 2D trajectories using Bayesian inference. These include local movement patterns corresponding to the current and preferred velocities and global characteristics such as entry points and movement features. Our approach involves no precomputation and we demonstrate the real-time performance of our prediction algorithm on sparse and noisy trajectory data extracted from dense indoor and outdoor crowd videos. The combination of local and global movement patterns can improve the accuracy of long-term prediction by 12-18% over prior methods in high-density videos."
icra,None,Hierarchical online domain adaptation of deformable part-based models,"Jiaolong Xu,David Vázquez,Krystian Mikolajczyk,Antonio M. López,","We propose an online domain adaptation method for the deformable part-based model (DPM). The online domain adaptation is based on a two-level hierarchical adaptation tree, which consists of instance models in the leaf nodes and a category model at the root node. Moreover, combined with a multiple object tracking procedure (MOT), our proposal neither requires target-domain annotated data nor revisiting the source-domain data for performing the source-to-target domain adaptation of the DPM. From a practical point of view this means that, given a source-domain DPM and new video for training on a new domain without object annotations, our procedure outputs a new DPM adapted to the domain represented by the video. As proof-of-concept we apply our proposal to the challenging task of pedestrian detection. In this case, each instance model is an exemplar classifier trained online with only one pedestrian per frame. The pedestrian instances are collected by MOT and the hierarchical model is constructed dynamically according to the pedestrian trajectories. Our experimental results show that the adapted model achieves the accuracy of recent supervised domain adaptation methods (i.e., requiring manually annotated target-domain data), and improves the source model more than 10 percentage points."
icra,None,Walking compass with head-mounted IMU sensor,"Jens Windau,Laurent Itti,","Emerging wearable technologies offer new sensor placement options on the human body. Particularly, head-mounted glass-wear opens up new data capturing possibilities directly from the human head. This allows exploring new cyber-robotics algorithms (robotics sensors and human motor plant). Glass-wear systems, however, require additional compensation for head motions that will affect the captured sensor data. Particularly, pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR), activity recognition, and other applications are limited or restricted when head-mounted sensors are used, because of possible confusion between head and body movements. Thus, previous PDR approaches typically required to keep the head pointing direction aligned with the walking direction to avoid positional errors. This paper presents a head-mounted orientation system (HOS) that identifies and filters out interfering head motions in 3 steps. Step 1 transforms inertial sensor data into a stable normalized coordinate system (roll/pitch motion compensated). Step 2 compares walking patterns before and after a rotating motion. Step 3 eliminates interfering head motions from sensor data by dynamically adjusting the noise parameters of the extended Kalman filter. HOS has been implemented on a Google Glass platform and achieved high accuracy in tracking a person's path even in the presence of head movements (within 2.5% of traveled distance) when tested in multiple real-world scenarios. By eliminating head motions, HOS not only enables accurate PDR, but also facilitates the task for downstream activity recognition algorithms."
icra,None,Automatic bone parameter estimation for skeleton tracking in optical motion capture,"Tobias Schubert,Katharina Eggensperger,Alexis Gkogkidis,Frank Hutter,,,","Motion analysis is important in a broad range of contexts, including animation, bio-mechanics, robotics and experiments investigating animal behavior. For applications, in which tracking accuracy is one of the main requirements, passive optical motion capture systems are widely used. Many skeleton tracking methods based on such systems use a predefined skeleton model, which is scaled once in the initialization step to the individual size of the character to be tracked. However, there are remarkable differences in the bone length relations across gender and even more across mammal races. In practice, the optimal skeleton model has to be determined in a manual and time-consuming process. In this paper, we reformulate this task as an optimization problem aiming to rescale a rough hierarchical skeleton structure to optimize probabilistic skeleton tracking performance. We solve this optimization problem by means of state-of-the-art blackbox optimization methods based on sequential model-based Bayesian optimization (SMBO). We compare different SMBO methods on three real-world datasets with an animal and humans, demonstrating that we can automatically find skeleton structures for previously unseen mammals. The same methods also allow an automated choice of a suitable starting frame for initializing tracking."
icra,None,Compact coaxial thermal and color imaging system with silicon-glass hybrid lens,"Tomoyuki Takahata,Kiyoshi Matsumoto,Isao Shimoyama,","Detecting human is one of the most important functions of service robots assisting human lives. Thermal images are useful to detect human. Since the number of pixels of the thermal imagers is smaller than that of color imagers, thermal images get more useful combined with corresponding color images. In this paper, we propose a compact optical system to obtain both thermal and color images simultaneously. The key is to use a silicon-glass hybrid lens, with which visible and far-infrared light can be focused. The focused light was split by a silicon plate. The thermal and color images were taken by a thermal and color imager, respectively. We experimentally showed that the focal plane was tuned by the position of the lens keeping the correspondence of thermal and color images."
icra,None,Tele-operation system with reliable grasping force estimation to compensate for the time-varying sEMG feature,"MinKyu Kim,Jaemin Lee,Keehoon Kim,","This paper presents a real-time framework for tele-manipulation by using sEMG signals to estimate both human motion and force intention. Our previous study showed that the ability to detect discrete force levels was not applicable to complex tasks such as grasping, holding, and manipulating various objects with variable force. Consequently, we identified the need to simultaneously track the arm and hand configurations and estimate the grasping force. However, it is difficult to continuously estimate the grasping force because of the time-varying nature of surface Electromyogram (sEMG) signals, even if a force remains constant. To solve such a problem, this study proposes a new regression strategy to enable continuous and proportional measurements and transmission of the grasping force by using sEMG signals in transient and steady-states. A 7-DOF robot arm with a robotic hand was able to remotely imitate a subject via an easily-wearable sEMG and inertia measurement units sensor interface. The experimental results verified that the motion and force capturing system successfully enabled interaction tasks, such as grasping, holding, and releasing motions with objects, with reliable and continuous force estimation."
icra,None,Optic-flow based car-like robot operating in a 5-decade light level range,"Stefano Mafrica,Alain Servel,Franck Ruffier,","In this paper, we present (i) a novel bio-inspired 1-D OF sensor which is robust to high-dynamic-range lighting conditions and independent of the visual patterns encountered, and (ii) a low-cost car-like robot called BioCarBot, which estimates its velocity and steering angle by means of an Extended Kalman Filer (EKF) using only the OF measurements delivered by two downward-facing sensors of this kind. Indoor experiments were carried out, in which the robot was driven in the closed-loop mode, using a proportional integral (PI) controller based on the velocity and steering angle estimates. The results presented here show that our novel OF sensor can deliver a wide range of high-frequency (333Hz) OF measurements (from 1 to 10 rad/s ) with a relatively high resolution (up to 0.05 rad/s) in a 5-decade high-dynamic range of light levels. Neither the refresh rate nor the resolution of the OF sensors presented here depended on either the visual patterns or the lighting conditions, and could be theoretically set at whatever value required."
icra,None,Large-scale model-assisted bundle adjustment using Gaussian max-mixtures,"Paul Ozog,Ryan M. Eustice,","This paper reports on a model-assisted bundle adjustment framework in which visually-derived features are fused with an underlying three-dimensional (3D) mesh provided a priori. By using an approach inspired by the expectation-maximization (EM) class of algorithms, we introduce a hidden binary label for each visual feature that indicates if that feature is considered part of the nominal model, or if the feature corresponds to 3D structure that is absent from this model. Therefore, in addition to improved estimates of the feature locations, we can also label the features based on their deviation from the model. We show that this method is a special case of the Gaussian max-mixtures framework, which can be efficiently incorporated into state-of-the-art graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solvers. We provide field tests taken from the Bluefin Robotics Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) surveying the SS Curtiss."
icra,None,Hybrid driving-stepping locomotion with the wheeled-legged robot Momaro,"Max Schwarz,Tobias Rodehutskors,Michael Schreiber,Sven Behnke,","Locomotion in uneven terrain is important for a wide range of robotic applications, including Search&Rescue operations. Our mobile manipulation robot Momaro features a unique locomotion design consisting of four legs ending in pairs of steerable wheels, allowing the robot to omnidirectionally drive on sufficiently even terrain, step over obstacles, and also to overcome height differences by climbing. We demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of this design on the example of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, where our team NimbRo Rescue solved seven out of eight tasks in only 34 minutes. We also introduce a method for semi-autonomous execution of weight-shifting and stepping actions based on a 2D heightmap generated from 3D laser data."
icra,None,Actively articulated suspension for a wheel-on-leg rover operating on a Martian analog surface,"William Reid,Francisco Javier Pérez-Grau,Ali Haydar Göktoğan,Salah Sukkarieh,",Actively articulated wheel-on-leg rovers offer high degrees of mobility for traversing unstructured and scientifically interesting terrain. An ability to actively conform to the terrain to increase traversability is sought. A kinematic model based on recursive kinematic propagation in combination with a terrain map generated online is used to solve desired limb articulation angles that meet operator defined rover body trajectories. This technique is validated in field tests on a Martian analog terrain.
icra,None,Recurrent Neural Networks for fast and robust vibration-based ground classification on mobile robots,"Sebastian Otte,Christian Weiss,Tobias Scherer,Andreas Zell,","This paper investigates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Dynamic Cortex Memories (DCMs), an extension of Long Short Term Memories (LSTMs) for classification of 14 different ground types based on vibration data. Also a simple regularization technique called Sequence Boundary Dropout (SBD) is introduced, which effectively enlarges the training set and improves generalization. The neural networks perform in the time domain without any explicit feature computation, while previous state-of-the-art methods extract features mainly in the frequency domain. The presented approach does not require a time window, is causal, and works just-in-time, such that a classification can be done online at each new time step. Furthermore, we show that the neural networks outperform previous methods significantly in terms of classification accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the networks retrained with Random Activation Preservation (RAP) can classify very early - within a fraction of a second - but robustly at the same time in a continuous recognition scenario with varying classes."
icra,None,FAD learning: Separate learning for three accelerations -learning for dynamics of boat through motor babbling,"Akio Numakura,Shigenobu Kato,Kazuyuki Sato,Takeya Tomizawa,,,,","This paper addresses the modeling and measurement of a small boat. In some fishing tasks, anchorage is not applicable in order to capture shellfishes or fishes efficiently. Currently, many fishermen are manually stabilizing boats simultaneously with the capturing task. We propose a boat modeling method named FAD learning. In this method, the free dynamics acceleration and actuator acceleration of a boat are learned using the online learning of two dynamics learning trees (DLTs), which are developed by us. In order to measure the position, velocity, and acceleration, we developed an image processing method with an underwater camera. In the experiment, the motor babbling of a boat was performed on a water pool. The dynamical data from the boat was learned by DLTs. The effectiveness of the modeling was confirmed through the validation of the velocity that was predicted by DLTs."
icra,None,Skyline-based localisation for aggressively manoeuvring robots using UV sensors and spherical harmonics,"Thomas Stone,Dario Differt,Michael Milford,Barbara Webb,","Place recognition is a key capability for navigating robots. While significant advances have been achieved on large, stable platforms such as robot cars, achieving robust performance on rapidly manoeuvring platforms in outdoor natural conditions remains a challenge, with few systems able to deal with both variable conditions and large tilt variations caused by rough terrain. Taking inspiration from biology, we propose a novel combination of sensory modality and image processing to obtain a significant improvement in the robustness of sequence-based image matching for place recognition. We use a UV-sensitive fisheye lens camera to segment sky from ground, providing illumination invariance, and encode the resulting binary images using spherical harmonics to enable rotation-invariant image matching. In combination, these methods also produce substantial pitch and roll invariance, as the spherical harmonics for the sky shape are minimally affected, providing the sky remains visible. We evaluate the performance of our method against a leading appearance-invariant technique (SeqSLAM) and a leading viewpoint-invariant technique (FAB-MAP 2.0) on three new outdoor datasets encompassing variable robot heading, tilt, and lighting conditions in both forested and urban environments. The system demonstrates improved condition- and tilt-invariance, enabling robust place recognition during aggressive zigzag manoeuvring along bumpy trails and at tilt angles of up to 60 degrees."
icra,None,Fast 6D pose estimation for texture-less objects from a single RGB image,"E. Muñoz,Y. Konishi,V. Murino,A. Del Bue,","A fundamental step to solve bin-picking and grasping problems is the accurate estimation of an object 3D pose. Such visual task usually rely on profusely textured objects: standard procedures such as detection of interest points or computation of appearance-based descriptors are favoured by using a highly informative surface. However, texture-less objects or their parts (i.e., those whose surface texture is poorly conditioned) are common in any environment but still challenging to deal with. This is due the fact that the distribution of surface brightness makes difficult to compute interest points or appearance-based descriptors. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the 3D pose for texture-less objects given a coarse initialization: the pose is estimated using using edge correspondences, where the similarity measure is encoded using a pre-computed linear regression matrix. Furthermore, we also propose a method to increase the robustness of the estimated pose against background and object clutter. We validate both methods by using synthetic and real image sequences with objects with known ground truth."
icra,None,Probabilistic traversability map generation using 3D-LIDAR and camera,"Juil Sock,Jun Kim,Jihong Min,Kiho Kwak,","Estimating the traversability of rough terrain is a critical task for an outdoor mobile robot. While classifying structured environment can be learned from large number of training data, it is an extremely difficult task to learn and estimate traversability of unstructured rough terrain. Moreover, in many cases information from a single sensor may not be sufficient for estimating traversability reliably in the absence of artificial landmarks such as lane markings or curbs. Our approach estimates traversability of the terrain and build a 2D probabilistic grid map online using 3D-LIDAR and camera. The combination of LIDAR and camera is favoured in many robotic application because they provide complementary information. Our approach assumes the data captured by these two sensors are independent and build separate traversability maps, each with information captured from one sensor. Traversability estimation with vision sensor autonomously collects training data and update classifier without human intervention as the vehicle traverse the terrain. Traversability estimation with 3D-LIDAR measures the slopes of the ground to predict the traversability. Two independently built probabilistic maps are fused using Bayes' rule to improve the detection performance. This is in contrast with other methods in which each sensor performs different tasks. We have implemented the algorithm on a UGV(Unmanned Ground Vehicle) and tested our approach on a rough terrain to evaluate the detection performance."
icra,None,Automated coding of activity videos from an OCD study,"Joshua Fasching,Nicholas Walczak,Gail A. Bernstein,Tasoulla Hadjiyanni,,,,","Analysis of behavior using video is a promising approach for identifying risk markers for psychopathology that can be applied in a wide range of populations. Computer vision techniques are needed to automatically code behavior in order to reduce time and effort in these analyses. This paper discusses algorithms developed for the automatic analysis of video data from a study regarding the impact of environmental factors on youths with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Overhead videos of subjects washing hands were automatically annotated for activities such as rinsing, applying soap, and turning on/off the water faucet. These automated annotations were created by using a color-based background subtraction method to create a foreground probability score which is then used to determine if various labeled regions of interest (ROIs) are activated. These activation signals are then characterized and used to determine when different substeps of the handwashing procedure are performed. Automated annotations were validated by comparisons with hand-labeled ground truth."
icra,None,Tracking multiple rigid symmetric and non-symmetric objects in real-time using depth data,"Sharath Akkaladevi,Martin Ankerl,Christoph Heindl,Andreas Pichler,","In this paper, a robust, real-time object tracking approach capable of dealing with multiple symmetric and non-symmetric objects in a real-time requirement setting is proposed. The approach relies only on depth data to track multiple objects in a dynamic environment and uses random-forest based learning to deal with problems like object occlusion, motion-blur due to camera motion and clutter. We show that the relation between object motion and the corresponding change in its 3D point cloud data can be learned using only 6 random forests. A framework that unites object pose estimation and object pose tracking to efficiently track multiple objects in 3D space is presented. The approach is robust in tracking objects even in presence of motion blur that causes noisy depth data and is capable of real-time performance with 1.8ms per frame. The experimental evaluations demonstrate the performance of the approach against robustness, accuracy and speed and compare the approach with the state of the art. A publicly available dataset with real-world data is also provided for future benchmarking."

We present a Vision-Based Measurement (VBM) system and evaluate how different conditions and algorithms impact the measuring of beveled edges. The proposed system integrates hardware and software to image the welding plates using a single CMOS camera as visual sensor, run computer vision algorithms on a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) board, controls the robot movements and adjust the weld pattern and welder equipment parameters. A complete prototype, using a commercial linear welding robot is presented. The evaluation of the system as a groove mapping equipment, considering different processing algorithms combined with noise removal and line segment detection techniques, shows the potential of the approach for shop floor operation."
icra,None,Probabilistic visual verification for robotic assembly manipulation,"Changhyun Choi,Daniela Rus,","In this paper we present a visual verification approach for robotic assembly manipulation which enables robots to verify their assembly state. Given shape models of objects and their expected placement configurations, our approach estimates the probability of the success of the assembled state using a depth sensor. The proposed approach takes into account uncertainties in object pose. Probability distributions of depth and surface normal depending on the uncertainties are estimated to classify the assembly state in a Bayesian formulation. The effectiveness of our approach is validated in comparative experiments with other approaches."
icra,None,Design and characterization of a debriding tool in robot-assisted treatment of osteolysis,"Farshid Alambeigi,Shahriar Sefati,Ryan J. Murphy,Iulian Iordachita,,","This paper focuses on the design and quantitative characterization of a debriding tool integrated with a robotic system to treat osteolysis (bone degradation). Osteolysis typically occurs due to wear of the polyethylene liner of the acetabular implant after total hip replacement surgery. In less invasive treatment of osteolysis, surgeons conventionally use rigid tools to debride the lesion, however with these inflexible instruments, complex lesion shapes are not completely treatable (about 50%). To address this issue, we have developed a debriding tool that passes through the lumen of a continuum dexterous manipulator (CDM). Integration of the CDM with a robotic arm assists the surgeon to reach the desired region behind the implant. Performance of the debriding tool integrated with this system was quantitatively evaluated during a simulated robot-assisted lesion debriding scenario. Rotational speed, aspiration pressure and irrigation flow of the debriding tool, as well as the sweeping velocity of the robotic system were identified as effective parameters in this procedure. Results indicate that maximum efficiency of the tool is achievable in a particular combination of these parameters."
icra,None,Multi-sensor surface analysis for robotic ironing,"Yinxiao Li,Xiuhan Hu,Danfei Xu,Yonghao Yue,Eitan Grinspun,,","Robotic manipulation of deformable objects remains a challenging task. One such task is to iron a piece of cloth autonomously. Given a roughly flattened cloth, the goal is to have an ironing plan that can iteratively apply a regular iron to remove all the major wrinkles by a robot. We present a novel solution to analyze the cloth surface by fusing two surface scan techniques: a curvature scan and a discontinuity scan. The curvature scan can estimate the height deviation of the cloth surface, while the discontinuity scan can effectively detect sharp surface features, such as wrinkles. We use this information to detect the regions that need to be pulled and extended before ironing, and the other regions where we want to detect wrinkles and apply ironing to remove the wrinkles. We demonstrate that our hybrid scan technique is able to capture and classify wrinkles over the surface robustly. Given detected wrinkles, we enable a robot to iron them using shape features. Experimental results show that using our wrinkle analysis algorithm, our robot is able to iron the cloth surface and effectively remove the wrinkles."
icra,None,Safe and robust robot maneuvers based on reach control,"Marijan Vukosavljev,Ivo Jansen,Mireille E. Broucke,Angela P. Schoellig,","In this paper, we investigate the synthesis of piecewise affine feedback controllers to address the problem of safe and robust controller design in robotics based on high-level controls specifications. The methodology is based on formulating the problem as a collection of reach control problems on a polytopic state space. Reach control has so far only been developed in theory and has not been tested experimentally on a real system before. Using a quadrocopter as our experimental platform, we show that these theoretical tools can achieve fast, albeit safe and robust maneuvers. In contrast to most traditional control techniques, the reach control approach does not require a predefined open-loop reference trajectory or spacial path. Experimental results on a quadrocopter show the effectiveness and robustness of this control approach. In a proof-of-concept demonstration, the reach controller is implemented in one translational direction while the other degrees of freedom are stabilized by separate controllers."
icra,None,Robust and adaptive whole-body controller for humanoids with multiple tasks under uncertain disturbances,"Jinoh Lee,Houman Dallali,Maloin Jin,Darwin Caldwell,Nikolaos Tsagarakis,","This paper focuses on the development of a dynamic model-free whole-body controller for a humanoid robot with high kinematic redundancy. The proposed controller is based on force-level operational-space control framework, which computes joint torques for the required forces of prioritized multiple tasks. While typical approaches based on this framework require to obtain an accurate robot dynamics model, which has been generally recognized as a major hurdle to overcome for implementation in real humanoid robots, the proposed controller incorporates adaptive sliding-mode and online dynamics estimation schemes; thus, it can be easily realized on a humanoid without identifying complex robot dynamic parameters. As a result, the gains of the proposed controller are adaptively adjusted to assure the control accuracy, when the humanoid robot changes its posture and undergoes uncertain disturbances. Experiments with a 23-DoFs humanoid under uncertain disturbances verify that the proposed controller can robustly perform multiple tasks with high accuracy."
icra,None,Adaptive control for robot navigation in human environments based on social force model,"Chen Wang,Yanan Li,Shuzhi Sam Ge,Tong Heng Lee,","In this paper, we introduce a novel control scheme based on the social force model for robots navigating in human environments. Social proxemics potential field is constructed based on the theory of proxemics and used to generate social interaction force for design of robot motion control. A combined kinematic/dynamic control is proposed to make the robot follow the target social force model, in the presence of kinematic velocity constraints. Under the proposed framework, given a specific social convention, robot is able to generate and modify its path smoothly without violating the proxemics constraints. The validity of the proposed method is verified through experimental studies using the V-rep platform."
icra,None,A study on the L1 optimal PD controller with application to joint motion control of a robot manipulator,"Kim Jung Hoon,Sung-moon Hur,Jongwoo Lee,Yonghwan Oh,","In this paper, we consider the L 1 optimal proportional-derivative (PD) controller synthesis by which the L ∞ gain of trajectory tracking systems can be reduced. The notion of input-to-state stability (ISS), which has been equipped with the L 2 norm of a vector-valued signal, plays important roles in evaluating the effect of disturbances on the system states. In connection with this, we first redefine the conventional ISS with the L ∞ norm to deal with bounded persistent disturbances because the disturbances should be mathematically regarded as elements of the L ∞ space. A tractable model for trajectory tracking control of robot systems is then given by using ideas of extended disturbance and composite error. We next introduce a design method of the L 1 optimal PD controller for such a model, by which the trajectory tracking system satisfies the redefined ISS and the L ∞ gain is less than a performance level γ. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of the design method through experimental results for a typical robot manipulator."
icra,None,Multiple-hypothesis chance-constrained target tracking under identity uncertainty,"Yoonseon Oh,Songhwai Oh,","We propose a robust target tracking algorithm for a mobile robot under identity uncertainty, which arises in crowded environments. When a mobile robot has a sensor with a fan-shaped field of view and finite sensing region, the proposed algorithm aims to minimize the probability of losing a moving target. We predict the next position of a moving target in a crowded environment using a multiple-hypothesis prediction algorithm which combines the motion model and appearance model of the target. When the distribution of the target's next position follows a Gaussian mixture model, the proposed tracking algorithm can track a target with a guaranteed tracking success probability. If the tracking success probability is sufficiently good, the method minimizes the moving distance of the mobile robot. The performance of the method is extensively validated in simulation and experiments using a Pioneer robot with a Microsoft Kinect sensor."
icra,None,Augmented −1 adaptive control of an actuated knee joint exoskeleton: From design to real-time experiments,"H. Rifaï,M.S. Ben Abdessalem,A. Chemori,S. Mohammed,Y. Amirat,","This paper deals with the control of a lower limb exoskeleton acting at the knee joint level. Classical −1 adaptive control law is proposed to ensure assistance-as-needed and resistive rehabilitation following a desired trajectory that is defined by a therapeutic doctor. This control law introduces a time lag within the desired trajectory tracking due to the presence of a filter in its structure. In order to mitigate this drawback, the classical −1 adaptive control is augmented by a nonlinear proportional control. The classical and augmented −1 adaptive control laws are tested in real-time using the Exoskeleton Intelligently COmmunicating and Sensitive to Intention (EICOSI) of LISSI-lab. Real-time experimental results highlight the utility of these control laws in assistance-as-needed and resistive rehabilitation paradigms."
icra,None,Adaptive-Robust Control of uncertain Euler-Lagrange systems with past data: A time-delayed approach,"Spandan Roy,Indra Narayan Kar,","A new adaptive robust control strategy, christened as Adaptive Time-delayed Robust Control (ATRC) is presented in this paper for trajectory tracking control of a class of Euler-Lagrange systems subjected to uncertainties with unknown bounds. The adaptive law to compute the switching gain of the conventional adaptive-robust controllers require either complete nominal modelling of the system or uncertainty bound. The proposed control framework amalgamates the best features of the switching control logic and time-delayed logic. The proposed control strategy approximates the unknown dynamics through time-delayed logic, and the switching logic provides robustness against the approximation error. A novel adaptive law for the switching control is developed which does not require uncertainty modelling or the knowledge of its bound and the switching gain adapts itself according to the tracking error incurred by the system. Moreover, a new design methodology and stability criterion for time-delayed control is proposed. Experimental results of the proposed methodology using a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is presented and improved tracking accuracy of the proposed control law is noted compared to the conventional time-delayed control and time-delayed control with gradient estimator."
icra,None,Place categorization and semantic mapping on a mobile robot,"Niko Sünderhauf,Feras Dayoub,Sean McMahon,Ben Talbot,Ruth Schulz,,,,,","In this paper we focus on the challenging problem of place categorization and semantic mapping on a robot without environment-specific training. Motivated by their ongoing success in various visual recognition tasks, we build our system upon a state-of-the-art convolutional network. We overcome its closed-set limitations by complementing the network with a series of one-vs-all classifiers that can learn to recognize new semantic classes online. Prior domain knowledge is incorporated by embedding the classification system into a Bayesian filter framework that also ensures temporal coherence. We evaluate the classification accuracy of the system on a robot that maps a variety of places on our campus in real-time. We show how semantic information can boost robotic object detection performance and how the semantic map can be used to modulate the robot's behaviour during navigation tasks. The system is made available to the community as a ROS module."
icra,None,SceneNet: An annotated model generator for indoor scene understanding,"Ankur Handa,Viorica Pătrăucean,Simon Stent,Roberto Cipolla,","We introduce SceneNet, a framework for generating high-quality annotated 3D scenes to aid indoor scene understanding. SceneNet leverages manually-annotated datasets of real world scenes such as NYUv2 to learn statistics about object co-occurrences and their spatial relationships. Using a hierarchical simulated annealing optimisation, these statistics are exploited to generate a potentially unlimited number of new annotated scenes, by sampling objects from various existing databases of 3D objects such as ModelNet, and textures such as OpenSurfaces and ArchiveTextures. Depending on the task, SceneNet can be used directly in the form of annotated 3D models for supervised training and 3D reconstruction benchmarking, or in the form of rendered annotated sequences of RGB-D frames or videos."
icra,None,Learning to generalize 3D spatial relationships,"Jimmy Li,David Meger,Gregory Dudek,","This paper presents an approach to learn meaningful spatial relationships in an unsupervised fashion from the distribution of 3D object poses in the real world. Our approach begins by extracting an over-complete set of features to describe the relative geometry of two objects. Each relationship type is modeled using a relevance-weighted distance over this feature space. This effectively ignores irrelevant feature dimensions. Our algorithm RANSEM for determining subsets of data that share a relationship as well as the model to describe each relationship is based on robust sample-based clustering. This approach combines the search for consistent groups of data with the extraction of models that precisely capture the geometry of those groups. An iterative refinement scheme has shown to be an effective approach for finding concepts of differing degrees of geometric specificity. Our results show that the models learned by our approach correlate strongly with the English labels that have been given by a human annotator to a set of validation data drawn from the NYUv2 real-world Kinect dataset, demonstrating that these concepts can be automatically acquired given sufficient experience. Additionally, the results of our method significantly out-perform K-means, a standard baseline for unsupervised cluster extraction."
icra,None,Monocular reconstruction of vehicles: Combining SLAM with shape priors,"Falak Chhaya,Dinesh Reddy,Sarthak Upadhyay,Visesh Chari,M. Zeeshan Zia,,","Reasoning about objects in images and videos using 3D representations is re-emerging as a popular paradigm in computer vision. Specifically, in the context of scene understanding for roads, 3D vehicle detection and tracking from monocular videos still needs a lot of attention to enable practical applications. Current approaches leverage two kinds of information to deal with the vehicle detection and tracking problem: (1) 3D representations (eg. wireframe models or voxel based or CAD models) for diverse vehicle skeletal structures learnt from data, and (2) classifiers trained to detect vehicles or vehicle parts in single images built on top of a basic feature extraction step. In this paper, we propose to extend current approaches in two ways. First, we extend detection to a multiple view setting. We show that leveraging information given by feature or part detectors in multiple images can lead to more accurate detection results than single image detection. Secondly, we show that given multiple images of a vehicle, we can also leverage 3D information from the scene generated using a unique structure from motion algorithm. This helps us localize the vehicle in 3D, and constrain the parameters of optimization for fitting the 3D model to image data. We show results on the KITTI dataset, and demonstrate superior results compared with recent state-of-the-art methods, with upto 14.64 % improvement in localization error."
icra,None,Towards visual mapping in industrial environments - a heterogeneous task-specific and saliency driven approach,"J. Rafid Siddiqui,Henrik Andreasson,Dimiter Driankov,Achim J. Lilienthal,","The highly percipient nature of human mind in avoiding sensory overload is a crucial factor which gives human vision an advantage over machine vision, the latter has otherwise powerful computational resources at its disposal given today's technology. This stresses the need to focus on methods which extract a concise representation of the environment inorder to approach a complex problem such as visual mapping. This article is an attempt of creating a mapping system, which proposes an architecture that combines task-specific and saliency driven approaches. The proposed method is implemented on a warehouse robot. The proposed solution provide a priority framework which enables an industrial robot to build a concise visual representation of the environment.

icra,None,Scaling perception towards autonomous object manipulation — in knowledge lies the power,"Ferenc Bálint-Benczédi,Patrick Mania,Michael Beetz,","Mobile robots operating in a human environment face the challenge of recognizing objects that possess a multitude of different visual characteristics, affordances, and are found in visually challenging scenes. Because of this, perceptual capabilities of such robots need to go beyond detection or categorization of objects, and be able to answer queries not only about where certain objects are located based on their class label, but also about functional properties of these. To achieve an optimal performance, robots need to be aware of their environment, the task that they are to execute, and their perceptual capabilities. Given this knowledge, robotic agents need adequate mechanisms that apply the right method at the right time, in the right situation. In this paper we present a self-adaptive robotic perception system, that acts as a planner for task aware robot manipulation and enables querying on a broad domain. This is done through extending our existing perception framework, ROBOSHERLOCK, with the capability to adapt its perception pipelines based on the query, using knowledge-based reasoning. We will demonstrate the success of the approach, by presenting challenging queries, where the benefits of integrating knowledge processing into perception systems is shown."
icra,None,Find my office: Navigating real space from semantic descriptions,"Ben Talbot,Obadiah Lam,Ruth Schulz,Feras Dayoub,Ben Upcroft,,","This paper shows that by using only symbolic language phrases, a mobile robot can purposefully navigate to specified rooms in previously unexplored environments. The robot intelligently organises a symbolic language description of the unseen environment and “imagines” a representative map, called the abstract map. The abstract map is an internal representation of the topological structure and spatial layout of symbolically defined locations. To perform goal-directed exploration, the abstract map creates a high-level semantic plan to reason about spaces beyond the robot's known world. While completing the plan, the robot uses the metric guidance provided by a spatial layout, and grounded observations of door labels, to efficiently guide its navigation. The system is shown to complete exploration in unexplored spaces by travelling only 13.3% further than the optimal path."
