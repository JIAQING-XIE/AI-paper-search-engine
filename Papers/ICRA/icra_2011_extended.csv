The levitation in this system occurs because of the wing-in-ground effect that acts on a U-shaped guideway. In order to achieve the goal of this study, a small experimental prototype and a control method for stabilization along the Z axis and about the roll and pitch axes were developed, as described in this paper. The effectiveness of the developed control method is confirmed by experimental results.",9

Mersha,Raffaella Carloni,Stefano Stramigioli,","In this paper, we propose a generic model and a controller design for a class of underactuated aerial vehicles, namely for unmanned aerial vehicles whose primary support against gravity is thrust. The approach followed is based on energetic consideration and uses the formalisms of port-Hamiltonian systems and bond graphs. The controller is designed for both stabilization during hovering and for trajectory tracking tasks. The competency of the model and the performance of the controller are validated in simulation.",22

In particular, we are interested in autonomous navigation in buildings with multiple floors. To ensure that the robot is fully autonomous, we require all computation to occur on the robot without need for external infrastructure, communication, or human interaction beyond high-level commands. Therefore, we pursue a system design and methodology that enables autonomous navigation with real time performance on a mobile processor using only onboard sensors. Specifically, we address multi-floor mapping with loop closure, localization, planning, and autonomous control, including adaptation to aerodynamic effects during traversal through spaces with low vertical clearance or strong external disturbances. We present experimental results with ground truth comparisons and performance analysis.",506

Thorne,Mark Yim,","Micro air vehicles have emerged as a popular option for diverse robotic and teleoperated applications because of their inherent stealth, portability, and disposability. In this work, we adopt a system-level perspective for the development of a rotary-wing micro air vehicle and propose a new design that utilizes gyroscopic dynamics for attitude control. Unlike traditional vehicles where attitude control moments are generated by aerodynamic control surfaces, the proposed vehicle will leverage the existing angular momentum of its rotating components to generate gyroscopic moments for controlling attitude. The capacity to rapidly generate large gyroscopic control moments, coupled with the precision gained from eliminating the need for complex and restrictive aerodynamic models, improves both agility and adaptability. We present the design and analysis of a new flying machine including the dynamic model with simplified aerodynamics and a control scheme based on a model linearized around hover. Simulations show the responsiveness and stabilization of a simple linear controller for hover.",9

Fainekos,","In this paper, we introduce the problem of automatic formula revision for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) motion planning specifications. Namely, if a specification cannot be satisfied on a particular environment, our framework returns information to the user regarding (i) why the specification cannot be satisfied and (ii) how the specification can be modified so it can become satisfiable. This work contributes towards rendering temporal logic motion planning frameworks more user friendly by providing feedback to the user when the LTL planning phase fails.",71

MORSE provides several features of interest to robotics projects: it relies on a component-based architecture to simulate sensors, actuators and robots; it is flexible, able to specify simulations at variable levels of abstraction according to the systems being tested; it is capable of representing a large variety of heterogeneous robots and full 3D environments (aerial, ground, maritime); and it is designed to allow simulations of multiple robots systems. MORSE uses a “Software-in-the-Loop” philosophy, i.e. it gives the possibility to evaluate the algorithms embedded in the software architecture of the robot within which they are to be integrated. Still, MORSE is independent of any robot architecture or communication framework (middleware). MORSE is built on top of Blender, using its powerful features and extending its functionality through Python scripts. Simulations are executed on Blender's Game Engine mode, which provides a realistic graphical display of the simulated environments and allows exploiting the reputed Bullet physics engine. This paper presents the conception principles of the simulator and some use-case illustrations.",276

H. Cheng,","Cooperative multi-robot systems have been used in a vast array of fields and are of particular interest in perilous environments. One of the main issues in multi-robot systems is the lack of a common set of programming and control abstractions and middleware. Controlling and programming cooperative multi-robot systems is a highly complicated task that requires a flexible and agile control architecture and programming environment that are able to handle the distributed nature of multi-robot systems. A generalized, highly flexible and reconflgurable cooperative robot control platform called Mobile-R has been developed. Mobile-R consists of a mobile agent-based robot control system and a mission-based rapid deployment system. A real-world validation experiment involving cooperative multi-robot perimeter patrolling is presented.",15

We build the model based on a game theoretic queueing approach, and analyze four issues: 1) individual differences in operator skills/capabilities, 2) differences in difficulty of presenting tasks, 3) trade-off between human interaction and performance and 4) the impact of task heterogeneity in the optimal service decision-making and system performance. The subsequent analytical and numerical exploration helps under stand the way the decentralized decision-making scheme is affected by various service environments.",17
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980146,Online generation of kinodynamic trajectories for non-circular omnidirectional robots,"Christoph Sprunk,Boris Lau,Patrick Pfaffz,Wolfram Burgard,","This paper presents a novel approach to kino-dynamic trajectory generation for non-circular omnidirectional platforms that can be combined with existing path planners. We use quintic Bézier splines to specify position and orientation of the holonomic robot for every point in time. To fully exploit the capabilities of the holonomic robot we propose a novel path representation. It allows for continuous variation of path shapes in the spectrum between straight-line paths with turns on the spot and smooth paths with independent rotations and translations. Using this representation our method optimizes trajectories according to a user-defined cost function, considering the constraints of the platform. This way, it generates fast and efficient trajectories in an anytime fashion. The experiments carried out on an industrial robot show that our approach generates highly efficient and smooth motion trajectories that can be tracked with high precision and predictability. Furthermore, the system operates in real-world environments containing unmapped obstacles and narrow passages.",58

Porta,","The probabilistic belief networks that result from standard feature-based simultaneous localization and map building cannot be directly used to plan trajectories. The reason is that they produce a sparse graph of landmark estimates and their probabilistic relations, which is of little value to find collision free paths for navigation. In contrast, we argue in this paper that Pose SLAM graphs can be directly used as belief roadmaps. We present a method that devises optimal navigation strategies by searching for the path in the pose graph with lowest accumulated robot pose uncertainty, independently of the map reference frame. The method shows improved navigation results when compared to shortest paths both over synthetic data and real datasets.",60

When using lidar sensors scanning in front of the vehicle, uncertainty arises from ignorance and errors. Ignorance is due to the perception of new areas and errors come from imprecise pose estimation and noisy measurements. Complexity is also increased when the lidar provides multi-echo and multi-layer information. This paper presents an occupancy grid framework that has been designed to manage these different sources of uncertainty. A way to address this problem is to use grids projected onto the road surface in global and local frames. The global one generates the mapping and the local one is used to deal with moving objects. A credibilist approach is used to model the sensor information and to do a global fusion with the world-fixed map. Outdoor experimental results carried out with a precise positioning system show that such a perception strategy increases significantly the performance compared to a standard approach.",114

A virtual flexible curved bar with force delay has been modeled that connects the leader to the follower. The length of this virtual bar is a function of the turning radiuses of the leader vehicle. Through this model, the follower vehicle is in effect being virtually dragged by the leader through the virtual flexible curved bar. It is the virtual dragging force that makes the follower accelerate/decelerate so as to adjust its speed to match that of the leader. Finally, simulations were carried out in MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed algorithm has improved the trajectory tracking error greatly, compared to the virtual rigid straight link approach.",2

Submission is made for the special session ""ICRA Robot Challenge: Advancing Research Through Competitions"". The new MagPieR microrobot was specially designed for breaking the speed record, providing a planar magnetic actuation with an optimised coils setup and a subsequent piezoelectric actuation for improved sliding condition.

The scenario we are considering consists of several autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), transporting packages from an input location to one of several destinations, through an unstructured warehouse environment. The AGVs are equipped with wheel encoders, laser range finders and RFID tag readers. Each package has a RFID tag encoding its destination. A map of the warehouse is provided a priori. We have developed a layered control architecture that enables fully autonomous system operation. Starting with a map of the environment, the control system generates feasible paths, assigns tasks to the vehicles and schedules task execution. At the lowest layer, waypoint tracking controllers enable task execution. The proposed architecture has been successfully tested in a simulated scenario at the IEEE Virtual Manufacturing Automation Competition (VMAC), using the USARSim simulator.",6
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5979785,Control of multiple heterogeneous magnetic micro-robots on non-specialized surfaces,"Eric Diller,Steven Floyd,Chytra Pawashe,Metin Sitti,","In this work, we develop methods for controlling multiple untethered magnetic micro-robots (called Mag-μBots), with all dimensions under 1 mm, without the need for a specialized surface. We investigate sets of Mag-μBots that are geometrically and magnetically designed to respond uniquely to the same magnetic fields. The responses of geometrically dissimilar Mag-μBots with similar magnetization and a group of identically-fabricated Mag-μBots are investigated. By controlling the magnetic field waveforms, individual and subgroups of Mag-μBots are able to locomote in a parallel but dissimilar fashion. Specifically, the pulsing frequency of the imposed driving magnetic fields is used as a selection method among the Mag-μBots. This method for accomplishing motion discrimination is discussed, modeled, and tested. Independent global positioning of two and three robots is demonstrated in two-dimensional space. While individual Mag-μBot velocities can be as high as 7 mm/s, the effective velocities during multi robot control are found to be up to 2 mm/s. As this control method is accomplished without the use of a specialized surface, it has potential applications in areas such as micro-fluidic systems and bio-manipulation.",13

Popa,","The paper proposes a method of using laser as both a source of energy and means of control for untethered microrobots. Instead of using multiple laser spots to thermally control the motion of multiple robot actuators, the paper proposes to shape the power, frequency, and duty cycle of a single laser beam focused onto the whole body of the robot. It is shown through simulations that an appropriate selection of laser parameters along with a corresponding mechanical design can generate appropriate ""stick and slip"" motions resulting in 3-DOF (planar) operation for the microrobot with nonholonomic constraints. Based on the simulation results, we anticipate that the microrobot with a thickness of a few micrometers and a width of several hundred micrometers can achieve speeds in excess of a few mm/second, comparable with more conventional electrostatically and electromagnetically actuated microrobots. Initial experiments on chevron actuators confirm that pulsed laser can effectively drive stick-slip microrobots.",17

This method applies the theory of parameterized complexity to identify the source of complexity, and then separates and designates different tasks according to the strengths of autonomous planning and human reasoning for collaborative planning. The injection of human expertise via collaboration greatly helps to reduce the computational complexity of autonomous planning, and parameterized complexity analysis provides the much needed guideline for automated processes to decide when and what types of help are needed so that human intervention can be reduced to the minimum.",3
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980118,"A modular, redundant, multi-frame of reference representation for kinematic chains","Stephan Ehrenfeld,Martin V. Butz,","When dealing with light-weight robots with nonrigid limbs and joints and uncertain sensory readings, configuration state representations inevitably are approximate. Due to various types of sensory readings, which are usually body-grounded in different frames of reference, these configuration states may naturally be represented modularly distributed. From a different perspective, computational models of human motor planning suggest that the brain represents current body postures, such as the state of an arm, modularly within various frames of reference. Moreover, the different information sources, such as proprioceptive, anticipatory, and visual information, are probabilistically integrated. As a basis for such a representation, we propose a modular system that maintains a distributed self-representation in interactive frames of reference. We show that the resulting representation is highly noise robust and may be used to reach goals within various frames of reference while also considering other task constraints.",6

Based on these emerging monitoring techniques a new approach is proposed to determine the optimal control parameters and help to assess the weld quality. A causal model is built with the offline trained Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) as a pattern determination net which deals with the optimal pattern of the electrode displacement, i.e. the ideal parameter combination between the maximum electrode displacement and its expansion velocity, to provide more reliable welding process and qualified welds. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is valid and feasible to determine the controlled parameters for welding robots.",7

In this paper, the independent metering architecture that is considered uses five Electro-Hydraulic Poppet Valves (EHPV's). The proposed control method is applied to four of these valves, arranged in a Wheatstone bridge configuration, to regulate the flow of hydraulic oil coming into and out of an actuator. For simplicity, the fifth valve is operated via open-loop to control the supply pressure. Experimental data presented herein demonstrate that the control method learns the valve's conductance characteristics (i.e. the inverse input-state dynamic map of the valve) while simultaneously controlling the motion of the hydraulic actuator.",20

However, much of the work done in flapping wing MAVs till date has not shown performance improvements over their Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL), rotary-wing counterparts. Research and development over the years has shown that insects and birds have unmatched flying capabilities in the Low Reynolds Number Regime. Their phenomenal flight performance is attributed to among others the highly energy efficient actuation systems and their power to weight ratios. The paper proposes and illustrates new and energy-efficient actuation mechanisms and incorporating them into MAVs. The paper begins by elaborating on the background of our research and the need for energy efficiency in MAVs; followed by showcasing resonant, elastic/restorative actuation mechanisms and their control methodology to reduce flight-actuation energy requirements. In conclusion, the paper contrasts and compares all the actuation systems for power intake, scalability and mechanical complexity.",20

Um,Zheng Chen,Hilary Bart-Smith,","A novel depth control device has been designed and built. The proof-of-concept device utilizes the principles of electrolysis of water, enhanced by the inclusion of an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) membrane as a medium. The device design incorporates an artificial bladder where the volume of gas generated by electrolysis is controlled by a solenoid valve, thus changing the device's buoyancy. A set of gold electrodes, separated by an IPMC film, is used as a lightweight and compact electrolysis generator. IPMC acts as stable, low power, highly efficient and environmentally friendly gas generator. Experimental results using open-loop control show that the device is capable of controlling its buoyancy efficiently with no noise and low power consumption. Applications for this technology include integration into bio-inspired, unmanned underwater vehicles.",25

Milford,Gordon Wyeth,Janet Wiles,","The Lingodroids are a pair of mobile robots that evolve a language for places and relationships between places (based on distance and direction). Each robot in these studies has its own understanding of the layout of the world, based on its unique experiences and exploration of the environment. Despite having different internal representations of the world, the robots are able to develop a common lexicon for places, and then use simple sentences to explain and understand relationships between places even places that they could not physically experience, such as areas behind closed doors. By learning the language, the robots are able to develop representations for places that are inaccessible to them, and later, when the doors are opened, use those representations to perform goal-directed behavior.",30
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5980417,Object category recognition by a humanoid robot using behavior-grounded relational learning,"Jivko Sinapov,Alexander Stoytchev,","The ability to form and recognize object categories is fundamental to human intelligence. This paper proposes a behavior-grounded relational classification model that allows a robot to recognize the categories of household objects. In the proposed approach, the robot initially explores the objects by applying five exploratory behaviors (lift, shake, drop, crush and push) on them while recording the proprioceptive and auditory sensory feedback produced by each interaction. The sensorimotor data is used to estimate multiple measures of similarity between the objects, each corresponding to a specific coupling between an exploratory behavior and a sensory modality. A graph-based recognition model is trained by extracting features from the estimated similarity relations, allowing the robot to recognize the category memberships of a novel object based on the object's similarity to the set of familiar objects. The framework was evaluated on an upper-torso humanoid robot with two large sets of household objects. The results show that the robot's model is able to recognize complex object categories (e.g., metal objects, empty bottles, etc.) significantly better than chance.",61

The modular snake robot is formed into a helical shape which can be described by various parameters such as the helical pitch angle, the radius and the pitch distance. The torque in each axis of rotation is affected by the helical pitch angle parameter. Five grasping configurations with different helical pitch angle were tested on the 18 degree of freedoms, 7 modules wheeled snake robot. The experimental result showed that the torque around yaw axis transferred to the pitch axis when the helical pitch angle was increasing. The profile of torque magnitude along the robot's body resulted in parabolic shape due to the unbalanced grasping force of the discrete points of contact between the robot and the pole.",7

The experimental apparatus which allows a robotic model to accelerate from rest to a steady speed under self-propelled conditions is clearly described. In the current apparatus, the robotic fish is mounted on a servo guide rail system and the towing speed is not preset but determined by the measured force acting on the body of the fish. Such an apparatus enables the simultaneous measurement of power consumption, thrust efficiency and speed of a robotic model obtained under self-propelled conditions. The thrust efficiency of the robotic fish can be estimated based on a 2-D vortex ring force estimation method. By comparing the thrust performance of carangiform body-shaped robotic swimmer with different typical BCF (body and caudal fin ) swimming modes, i.e. anguilliform, carangiform and thunniform, we show that the robotic swimming fish with the thunniform kinematic movement not only reaches a higher steady swimming speed but is also more efficient than the other two modes However, in the start phase, using the anguilliform kinematic movement, the robotic swimmer accelerates faster among all kinematic movements. Ultimately, we found that the robotic fish always produce a double-row wake structure no matter which swimming mode used.",26

A set of four key parameters are introduced serving as external stimuli to shape the CPG rhythmic activities where necessary speed and orientation modulation as well as 3-D locomotion can be obtained. In terms of the built parameter set, a library of movement primitives based on finite state machine is established to facilitate rapid and smooth gait transitions. To enhance adaptive behaviors, well-integrated sensory feedback by means of two liquid-level detectors enables the gait transition between ground and water autonomously. Simulations and experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of a behavior based control architecture governed by CPGs.",7

This second prototype employs a new type of unsymmetrically laminated carbon fiber reinforced prepreg (CFRP) structure which has two different curvatures, and an SMA spring actuator.

Janot,","Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of the inverse dynamic model, which is linear with respect to the dynamic parameters. This model is calculated with torque and position sampled data while the robot is tracking reference trajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear least-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. This method requires the joint force/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity and acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high sampling rates. A new method called DIDIM (Direct and Inverse Dynamic Identification Models) has been proposed and validated on a 2 degree-of freedom robot [1]. DIDIM method requires only the joint force/torque measurement. It is based on a closed-loop simulation of the robot using the direct dynamic model, the same structure of the control law, and the same reference trajectory for both the actual and the simulated robot. The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of the error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque. A validation experiment on a 6 dof Staubli TX40 robot shows that DIDIM method is very efficient on industrial robots.",23

This is useful in situations where it is not practical to measure the camera pose directly. Our application domain is estimating the pose of a PTZ camera so that it can be used for automated GPS-based tracking and filming of UAV flight trials.

However, it is hard to measure the force accurately, because the fluid jet based force much depends upon the shape after deformation of object. This paper proposes an innovative approach where the external force is adaptively calibrated based on the deformation of object so that we can evaluate the internal stiffness parameters more accurately than that of conventional approaches. It is shown that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of force application with even 100% at an extreme case.",3

We present a novel set of permanent magnet modules that are under 1 mm in all dimensions, called Mag-μMods, for use in a reconfigurable micro-system. The modules are actuated by oscillating external magnetic fields of several mT in strength, and are capable of locomoting on a 2-D surface. Multiple modules are controlled using an electrostatic anchoring surface, which selectively prevents specific modules from being driven by the external field, while allowing others to move freely. We model the processes of both assembling and disassembling two modules by analyzing the forces the modules experience, and experimentally verify the accuracy of the models. For disassembly, we employ electrostatic anchoring and externally applied magnetic torques to successfully separate the modules.",90

To this end, the mechanical design of modular robots has to be flexible and robust enough for various complex configurations. The major contributions of the design of this Cross-Ball robots include: 1) it provides several flexible 3D reconfiguration capabilities, such as rotating, parallel, and diagonal movements; (2) a flexible and robust hardware platform for modular robots using more complex self-reconfiguration algorithms; and (3) the mobility of each individual module. Furthermore, a skeleton-based approach is proposed for the motion control of the modules, where the module movements can be conducted in groups to improve the system reconfiguration efficiency.

Matthies,Gaurav S. Sukhatme,","Stereo vision is useful for a variety of robotics tasks, such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, recovery of valid range data from stereo depends on accurate calibration of the extrinsic parameters of the stereo rig, i.e., the 6-DOF transform between the left and right cameras. Stereo self calibration is possible, but, without additional information, the absolute scale of the stereo baseline cannot be determined. In this paper, we formulate stereo extrinsic parameter calibration as a batch maximum likelihood estimation problem, and use GPS measurements to establish the scale of both the scene and the stereo baseline. Our approach is similar to photogrammetric bundle adjustment, and closely related to many structure from motion algorithms. We present results from simulation experiments using a range of GPS accuracy levels; these accuracies are achievable by varying grades of commercially-available receivers. We then validate the algorithm using stereo and GPS data acquired from a moving vehicle. Our results indicate that the approach is promising.",5

In the case of a unicycle robot model, the localization problem is equivalent to the system observability. Based on this observation, the proposed localization method consists in finding a vector function which depends on the measurement vector and its derivatives. In order to compute estimates of the successive derivatives of the measurement vector, we will use a numerical differentiation method. When the robot is able to only measure the relative angle between itself and the landmark in 2D case, the algorithm estimates the posture of the robot, under the hypothesis that control inputs are known. But, sometimes it is also useful to be able to estimate the control input (for example when the robot slips). This is possible with the proposed algorithm by using a landmark in dimension three. The simulation results will be given in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, these results are compared with those obtained by an Extended Kalman Filter in order to underline the advantages of the new algorithm.",20

All these functionalities must be versatile and generic enough to interact differently according to the missions while minimizing recoding effort. Moreover, deliberative functions like automated planning consume lots of memory and CPU time and usually complete in time incompatible with robotic missions' durations. Thus, we present a new generic and anytime planning concept for modular robotic architectures, which manages multiple planning requests at a time, solved in background, while allowing for reactive execution of planned actions at the same time. Different planners based on various formalisms and data structures can be plugged to the planning component without changing its behavior nor its code, facilitating reusability and validation of the component. We highlight the versatility of our concept on different use cases; then we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in terms of mission duration and success, compared with traditional plan-then-execute approaches; we finally present a search and rescue mission by an autonomous rotorcraft solved with our paradigm, that cannot be tackled by traditional approaches.",29

We propose a method for mapping a household environment using multiple stereo and depth cameras located on the humanoid head and the environment. The method relies on colored 3D point cloud data computed from the sensors. We achieve robot localization by matching the point clouds from the robot sensor data directly with the environment sensor data. Object detection is performed using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with a database of known point cloud models. In order to guarantee accurate object detection results, objects are only detected within the robot sensor data.

Currently, the availability of satellite positioning is anticipated to improve because of the presence of various positioning satellites such as GPS of the U.S., GLONASS of Russia and GALILEO of Europe. However, because of the serious impact of multipath on their positioning accuracy in urban or leafy areas, such improvements in the availability of satellite positioning do not necessarily also facilitate high precision positioning. Our proposed technique mitigates GPS and GLONASS multipath by means of an omnidirectional infrared (IR) camera that can eliminate the need for invisible satellites by using IR images. With an IR camera, the sky appears distinctively dark. This facilitates the detection of the borderline between the sky and the surrounding buildings, which are captured in white, because of the difference in the atmospheric transmittance rates between visible light and IR rays. The proposed technique can automatically and robustly mitigate GPS and GLONASS multipath by excluding the invisible satellites. Positioning evaluation was carried out only with visible satellites that have less multipath errors and without using invisible satellites. The evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique and the feasibility of its highly accurate positioning.",54

Each agent is capable of measuring the relative position and orientation of its neighboring agents, however these measurements are not exact but they are corrupted with noises. The goal is to compute the pose of each agent relative to an anchor node. We present a strategy where, first of all, the agents compute their orientations relative to the anchor. After that, they update the relative position measurements according to these orientations, to finally compute their positions. As contribution we discuss the proposed strategy, that has the interesting property that can be executed in a distributed fashion. The distributed implementation allows each agent to recover its pose using exclusively local information and local interactions with its neighbors.

Parker,","In our prior work, we proposed the IQ-ASyMTRe architecture as a general method to combine coalition formation and execution for tightly-coupled multirobot tasks. IQ ASyMTRe extends the ASyMTRe architecture by introducing several new mechanisms to provide more flexibility for coalition formation as well as to facilitate coalition execution. On the other hand, these mechanisms also change the process of reasoning about solutions and further increase the complexity of the solution space. In this paper, we provide improvements for utilizing the IQ-ASyMTRe architecture based on reasoning about the solution space. We introduce a method in which the exponential growth of the number of potential solutions to be searched can be avoided; instead, the search space is only of linear size for certain tasks. Unnecessary potential solutions are removed to further increase online efficiency. Moreover, the relationships between the created solution space and the complete solution space are studied, and are utilized to provide more coverage of the complete solution space for arbitrary tasks. Although these improvements are discussed with respect to IQ-ASyMTRe, they are also applicable to architectures that approach the generality that IQ-ASyMTRe achieves. Robot simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the generation and searching of the solution space can be done online (which was impractical previously even for tasks with relatively modest complexities) for certain tasks, and to illustrate how our approach impacts the solution space.",5

The parameters of the macroscopic model are mapped onto the deterministic and random components of individual robot motion and the probabilities that determine stochastic robot task transitions. For very large swarms that are prohibitively expensive to simulate, the macroscopic model, which is independent of the population size, is a useful tool for synthesizing robot control policies with guarantees on performance in a top-down fashion.

icra,None,Multi-view registration for feature-poor underwater imagery,"Nicholas Carlevaris-Bianco,Ryan M. Eustice,","This paper reports an algorithm for the registration of images with low overlap and low visual feature density- a typical characteristic of down-looking underwater imagery. Our algorithm exploits locally accurate temporal motion-priors and pairwise image correspondences to aggregate semi-rigid sets of sequential images. These sets are then used to search for visual correspondences across sets instead of between individual pairs of images. By simultaneously searching over multiple views, we increase the physical area seen by more than one image, effectively increasing the ""field of view"" of the image correspondence search. This increases the probability that the area viewed by both sets will contain enough visual features to register the sets. Our algorithm systematically reduces the uncertainty in the motion prior between the two sets resulting in a refined motion prior that is used to geometrically constrain the correspondence search between sets. This geometric constraint allows us to confidently identify local correspondences that would not be possible globally, further increasing our ability to register images in feature poor environments.

It is designed with a transformation mechanism which provides the features of parallel grippers, rotatory grippers, and active wheels. For truss climbing, MovGrip acts as a parallel gripper which allows the change in gripping width according to different size of trusses. Since MovGrip is equipped with active wheels, fast climbing motion can therefore be realized. Moreover, MovGrip can be transformed into a mobile platform which is suitable for the navigation on ground. It weighs only 500 grams with a climbing speed of 3 cm/s. To maintain the climbing stability, we steer the rotation axis of wheels. By this, a directional pulling force (from MovGrip to truss surface) can be distributed from the drive force of wheels which pulls MovGrip towards the truss while climbing.

Specifically, the set of measurement data obtained from the laser range finder mounted on a robot is further decomposed into several sectors using an appropriate segmentation technique. Then, we apply a probabilistic model to compare these sectors with leg patterns to check if any of them belongs to the set of human leg patterns or not. Next, we examine the promising leg sectors with a modified Inscribe Angle Variance (IAV) method in order to confirm if these sectors are from human leg's arc feature or not. Moreover, we also use motion detector to check if these objects move or not as an enhancement of the detection. For the entire multi-human detection system, each robot of the team delivers the detected human information to our central control computer through the Inter-Process Communication (IPC). With prior map information of the residing environment and supposing each robot in the team has a localization module, we can then map these results of human detection from every robot into their global coordinates after process of data association. But in order to reduce the computational complexity while doing the data association among these robots in a team, we introduce a set of appropriate rules.

icra,None,A POMDP framework for modelling human interaction with assistive robots,"Tarek Taha,Jaime Valls Miró,Gamini Dissanayake,","This paper presents a framework for modelling the interaction between a human operator and a robotic device, that enables the robot to collaborate with the human to jointly accomplish tasks. States of the system are captured in a model based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). States representing the human operator are motivated by behaviours from the psychology of the human action cycle. Hierarchical nature of these states allows the exploitation of data structures based on algebraic decision diagrams (ADD) to efficiently solve the resulting POMDP. The proposed framework is illustrated using two examples from assistive robotics; a robotic wheel chair and an intelligent walking device. Experimental results from trials conducted in an office environment with the wheelchair is used to demonstrate the proposed technique.",49

In this method, we design a controller to stabilize the position of the center of mass (COM), the orientation of the upper body and the motion of the swing leg using the kinematic model of a biped. The proposed method is not hindered by complexity of the computation because the proposed controller executes no contact force planning, and uses only a compact feedback for implementation. It is also robust to errors caused by the environment or internal motion. We prove the stability of the system according to the Lyapunov's direct method. Selected simulations are executed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.",5
icra,None,Stability analysis of passive compass gait using linearized model,"Fumihiko Asano,","The inherent self-stabilization mechanism of passive gait is one of the most fundamental question in the area of studies on limit cycle walking. It is well known that the limit cycle stability can be tested by calculating the eigenvalues of the approximated Poincare return map, and they have been calculated numerically in previous studies. Hirata and Kokame, however, firstly succeeded to derive the Jacobian matrix of the Poincare return map using linearization of the dynamic equation. In this paper, we reconsider their method and propose an easier approach to derive the discrete-time linear error system. Our approach enables to derive the error system without integral terms. Through the theoretical investigations, we show that a passive compass-gait is formed by the combination of unstable stance phases and marginally stable collision phases. The validity is investigated by numerical simulations.",32
icra,None,Rebalance strategies for humanoids walking by foot positioning compensator based on adaptive heteroscedastic SpGPs,"Tao Xu,Qijun Chen,Zhiqiang Cai,","To solve the rebalance problem of a full-body humanoid walking, an adaptive foot positioning compensation approach is proposed. To obtain a more precise initial policy, a constrained dynamics model is used to generate the offline policy. A heteroscedastic sparse Gaussian process is applied for online calculation of the foot positioning policy. In order to make the generated policy to adapt with the full-body dynamics, a sample-efficient MAP-like updating method for the heteroscedastic sparse Gaussian process model is also proposed. Experiments on both simulation and a real full-body humanoid are developed to show the performance of the final foot positioning policy. With the help of proposed method, the full-body humanoid robot succeeded walking down an elastic deformable platform and several obvious compensation foot steps can be observed for the robot to retrieve its balance.",6

A new method of walking pattern generation based on forward moving ZMP in SSP (Single Support Phase) is also provided. It can keep the ZMP moving forward instead of staying in the center of supporting region during SSP, which is helpful for increasing the walking speed.

icra,None,Self-collision avoidance and angular momentum compensation for a biped humanoid robot,"Markus Schwienbacher,Thomas Buschmann,Sebastian Lohmeier,,,","To simplify the development of new trajectories for a humanoid robot with many joints, the ability to check for potential collisions is crucial. More importantly, to enable on line generation of general motions, such as whole-body-motion, collision avoidance must be employed, which is usually more challenging. In this paper, a model-based and efficient on-line distance calculation between links of the robot is proposed. To avoid collisions the results are projected into the null space term of the inverse-kinematics which is based on the redundancy resolution framework of LIEGEOIS. Additionally, a novel method to reduce the vertical angular momentum for a walking biped robot which uses the arm motion is proposed. It reduces the vertical angular momentum of the walking robot especially for larger steps. Since the method also works in the null-space, it can easily be combined with the proposed collision avoidance scheme. Finally, results for the proposed methods from simulations and experiments with the robot Lola are shown.",40
icra,None,Design and control of a pneumatic quadrupedal walking robot,"Keith W. Wait,Michael Goldfarb,",The mechanical and electronics design of a quadrupedal walking robot featuring 12 pneumatically actuated degrees of freedom is presented. Control of the robot's joint motions incorporates open-loop damping into the actuation and uses a stance/swing gain scheduler in the joint position controller. The inclusion of these two attributes enables stable and robust joint-level control while attenuating the undesirable oscillatory modes that are commonly associated with pneumatically actuated walking robots. Joint motion trajectories that permit stable walking are developed and implemented in the robot. The combination of these features and techniques is experimentally shown to enable stable walking locomotion of the robot that is not inhibited by unwanted oscillations of significant magnitude.,2

Conventionally, the walking motion of a humanoid robot is performed through a repeated foot stepping motion. However, this motion is inefficient and has low stability. Previously, we have studied the shuffle-turning method for a humanoid robot, which can perform a stepless and stable turning. In this paper, we present a precise shuffle turn with feedback control and a new shuffle translation method by repeating shuffle turns. Experiments using a humanoid robot were conducted and the results revealed that the proposed method was effective for shuffle translation.",27

To make the direct comparison between a VR and real robots possible, the same designed robots in both VR and real are used in the experiment. For evaluating the robots on a psychological basis, we focused on six basic dimensions (Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness) that ordinary people generally use to perceive robots. Sixty-one participants observed and evaluated a real and VR humanoid robots using a psychological scale. Results show that the real robot was evaluated to have higher scores for Utility, Possibility of communication, and Objective hardness and lower ones for Controllability as compared to a VR robot. The Vulnerability scores of the real robot and the VR robot were not significantly different. The usability of a VR robot is discussed in the paper.",22

We first propose a passivity-based dynamic bipedal model to analyze the effects of segmented foot and compliant joints on energetic efficiency and stability of bipedal walking. Starting from the results of theoretical analysis, we construct a below-knee exoskeleton prototype with ankle and toe joints driven by two series-elastic actuators.

icra,None,Dead reckoning in a dynamic quadruped robot: Inertial navigation system aided by a legged odometer,"Michal Reinstein,Matej Hoffmann,","It is an important ability for any mobile robot to be able to estimate its posture and to gauge the distance it travelled. The information can be obtained from various sources. In this work, we have addressed this problem in a dynamic quadruped robot. We have designed and implemented a navigation algorithm for full body state (position, velocity, and attitude) estimation that does not use any external reference (such as GPS, or visual landmarks). Extended Kalman Filter was used to provide error estimation and data fusion from two independent sources of information: Inertial Navigation System mechanization algorithm processing raw inertial data, and legged odometry, which provided velocity aiding. We present a novel data-driven architecture for legged odometry that relies on a combination of joint sensor signals and pressure sensors. Our navigation system ensures precise tracking of a running robot's posture (roll and pitch), and satisfactory tracking of its position over medium time intervals. We have shown our method to work for two different dynamic turning gaits and on two terrains with significantly different friction. We have also successfully demonstrated how our method generalizes to different velocities.",47

The proposed approach based on Receding Horizon Control solves the formation navigation, planning and stabilization in real-word environments with static and dynamic obstacles. The formations employed for sweeping are built up ad-hoc, taking into account length of robots' effectors (e.g. shovels, sweepers) and width of the working area. Presented method enables to smoothly merge smaller teams with the view of sweeping the larger roads (e.g. runways, highways). The formations can operate in two modes: sweeping and moving. In the sweeping mode, the formations are guided with an aim to effectively cover the cleaning roads, while in the moving mode, the planning system emphasizes the effort to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the moving mode enables to autonomously design complex formation maneuvers, as is reverse driving or turning on spot.",17

Then on the hybrid map, the localization and the real-time path planning algorithms are realized smartly and effectively. The experiments and applications results show that the human-guided method integrates both the computer's modeling ability and the human's sensory perception to the environment. The hybrid map is easy to solve the loop-closure and doorway problems that enhances the robustness against uncertainty of sensors. It also can improve the efficiency in large-scale SLAM.

icra,None,Feedback and predictive motion control strategies for the off-road locomotion of the three-wheeled personal vehicle Falcon-III,"Ewerton Ickowzcy,Takeshi Aoki,Shigeo Hirose,","Falcon-III is a robotic personal vehicle that has been designed for uneven terrain usage. It has a two-degree-of-freedom suspension mechanism that allows the passenger's seat orientation (pitch and roll) to be controlled by actively adjusting the height of its wheels. This paper discusses the motion control of such a vehicle on rough terrain. In particular, we show that a feedback control law that measures the vehicle seat attitude and acts to correct it, aiming at maintaining the horizontal seat posture during the traversing of uneven terrain, is by itself insufficient to provide satisfactory performance on certain types of terrain. Therefore, we propose a predictive motion control strategy, in addition to the feedback control law, that dynamically controls the vehicle suspension in order to facilitate the negotiation of obstacles - the motion executed is somewhat similar to that performed by a cyclist when overcoming a step-like obstacle. When tall step-like obstacles have to be negotiated, it may be necessary to dynamically lift one of the wheels from the ground, in which case a gait pattern emerges.",0

Finally, we develop a subsurface explorer robot with propulsion and excavation units. Excavation experiments are successfully conducted using the excavator alone and at lighter weights. We show that the excavator can begin boring from a launcher, and in case of excavator of 1/6 of its own weight, it successfully excavates at the same depth as in its own weight. This demonstrates that this novel excavator is expected to accomplish future missions on other planets and the moon.",32

The architecture, navigation and localization systems are described along with the results achieved in different urban sites. In particular, a localization approach based on optical beacons was used and guaranteed position errors sufficient for a safe robot navigation.

icra,None,Optically tracked multi-robot system for keyhole neurosurgery,"Mirko Daniele Comparetti,Elena De Momi,Alberto Vaccarella,Matthias Riechmann,,","Robotic systems have been introduced in surgery to increase the intervention accuracy. In this framework, the ROBOCAST system is an optically controlled multi-robot chain aimed at enhancing the accuracy of surgical probe insertion during keyhole neurosurgery procedures. The system is composed by three robots, connected as a multiple kinematic chain (serial, parallel and linear) totaling 13 degrees of freedom (DoFs) and is it is used to automatically align the probe onto the desired trajectory. This paper presents an iterative approach for aligning the surgical probe with the planned target pose, reducing both the translation and the rotation errors. An experimental protocol was designed, in order to assess the system performances in terms of residual targeting errors and convergence ratio. The proposed targeting procedures allows obtaining (0.06 ± 0.02) mm and (0.8 ± 0.2) × 10 -3 rad as residual median errors, thus satisfying the operational requirements (1 mm).

icra,None,Algorithms for design of continuum robots using the concentric tubes approach: A neurosurgical example,"Tomer Anor,Joseph R.

These procedures require that the robot approach specified target sites while navigating and operating within an anatomically constrained work space. The availability of preoperative imaging makes our approach particularly suited for neurosurgery, and we illustrate the method with the example of endoscopic choroid plexus ablation. A novel parameterization of the robot characteristics is used in conjunction with a global pattern search optimization method. The formulation returns the design of the least-complex robot capable of reaching single or multiple target points in a confined space with constrained optimization metrics. A particular advantage of this approach is that it identifies the need for either fixed-curvature versus variable-curvature sections. We demonstrate the performance of the method in four clinically relevant examples.",91
icra,None,Design and implementation of a pneumatically-actuated robot for breast biopsy under continuous MRI,"Bo Yang,U-Xuan Tan,Alan McMillan,Rao Gullapalli,Jaydev P. Desai,","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is superior to other imaging modalities such as Ultrasound and Computed Tomography and is used for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, current breast biopsy procedures based on MR images obtained apriori, use a blind targeting approach, which can be long and painful. Current approaches, due to possible patient motion, can lead to tool tip positioning errors thereby affecting diagnostic accuracy and causing significant patient discomfort, if repeated procedures are required. Hence, it is desired to develop a MRI-compatible robot for breast biopsy procedures without removing the patient from the MRI bore. This approach could potentially avoid multiple biopsy needle insertions and minimize sampling errors. Due to the working principle of MRI, material, actuation, and sensing techniques are limited as the MR images must not be affected significantly during the procedure. In addition, the limited space of the MRI bore requires the robot to be compact. This paper presents a four degrees of freedom robot with a compact parallel mechanism of which three degrees of freedom are pneumatically actuated while the needle driver mechanism is actuated by a piezo motor. Fiber-optic force sensor is also designed, developed, and mounted on the top mobile platform of the parallel mechanism to sense the needle and tissue interaction forces. Position control of the pneumatic cylinders is implemented using PI control with a modified integration term to achieve a slow and smooth motion.",46
icra,None,Evaluation of fingertip force accuracy in different support conditions of exoskeleton,"Yasuhisa Hasegawa,Junichiro Tokita,Kiyotaka Kamibayashi,Yoshiyuki Sankai,","This paper investigates force accuracy of a human finger in three types of support conditions of an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton augments pinching force of a wearer's index finger in proportion to it based on surface electromyography. Three supporting manners of the pinching force are evaluated by switching a fingertip part of the exoskeleton. One is that the assistive force is applied to the wearer's finger so that the force could be sensible by the wearer. Another case is that the assistive force is directly delivered to a grasping object without a wearer's fingertip. The other is that a part of the force directly affects the object and the rest affects the wearer's finger. Through pilot experiments, transitions of the accuracy through training in these cases are compared each other.",36

Specifically, we address the task of picking up unknown objects from a table top. The proposed approach to object shape prediction aims at closing the knowledge gaps in the robot's understanding of the world. A completed state estimate of the environment can then be provided to a simulator in which stable grasps and collision-free movements are planned. The proposed approach is based on the observation that many objects commonly in use in a service robotic scenario possess symmetries. We search for the optimal parameters of these symmetries given visibility constraints. Once found, the point cloud is completed and a surface mesh reconstructed. Quantitative experiments show that the predictions are valid approximations of the real object shape. By demonstrating the approach on two very different robotic platforms its generality is emphasized.",114
icra,None,Flip-and-slide magnetic paired robots for aircraft manufacturing and maintenance,"Geoffrey Karasic,Harry Asada,","A paired robot system is developed for a class of tasks where two end-effectors work together; one placed inside and the other outside a confined box. The work was motivated by practical needs for aircraft wing box manufacturing and maintenance. Two robots, each carrying an end-effector, are engaged using strong magnets attracting each other and thereby supporting each body against gravity. The robots must move across the surface of the box, while avoiding interference with obstacles fixed to the surface. A novel paired robot with magnetic feet is presented that can flip and go over an obstacle while tightly holding each body against gravity. Furthermore, the paired robots can automatically be loaded and unloaded from the confined box through a small entry hole by flipping and sliding on the box surface. First the task conditions and functional requirements are described, and then the design concept of the flip-and-slide magnetic paired robots is presented. Kinematic and static models of the system are obtained, and the conditions for successful flipping and sliding are analyzed. Control algorithms for detaching as well as engaging magnetic feet are obtained. A prototype flip-and-slide paired robot system is designed and the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated.",4
icra,None,A multi-disciplinary design process for affective robots: Case study of Survivor Buddy 2.0,"Robin Murphy,Aaron Rice,Negar Rashidi,Zachary Henkel,Vasant Srinivasan,","Designing and constructing affective robots on schedule and within costs is especially challenging because of the qualitative, artistic nature of affective expressions. Detailed affective design principles do not exist, forcing an iterative design process. This paper describes a three step design process created for the Survivor Buddy project that engages artists in the design process and allows animation to guide physical implementation. The process combines creative design of believable agents unconstrained by costs with traditional design decision matrices. The paper provides a case study comparing the resulting design of the Survivor Buddy 2.0 robot with the original (Survivor Buddy 1.0). The multi-disciplinary methodology produced a more pleasing and expressive robot that was 50% less expensive, 78% lighter, and up to 700% faster within the same amount of design time. This methodology is expected to contribute to reducing risk in designing cost effective affective robots and robots in general.",6
icra,None,Motion planning for steep hill climbing,"Damion Dunlap,Wei Yu,Emmanuel G. Collins,Charmane V. Caldwell,","The motors or engines of an autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) have torque and power limitations, which limit their abilities to climb steep hills, which are defined to be hills that have high grade sections in which the vehicle is forced to decelerate. Traversal of a steep hill requires the vehicle to have sufficient momentum before entering the hill. This problem is part of a larger class of momentum-based motion planning problems such as the problem of lifting heavy objects with manipulators. Hence, solutions to the steep hill climbing problem have much wider applicability. The motion planning here is accomplished using a dynamic model of the skid-steered AGV used in the experiments along with Sampling Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC), a recently developed input sampling planning algorithm that may be viewed as a generalization of LPA* to the direct use of kinodynamic models. The motion planning is demonstrated experimentally using two scenarios, one in which the robot starts at rest at the bottom of a hill and one in which the robot starts at rest a distance from the hill. The first scenario requires the AGV to first reverse direction so that the vehicle can gather enough momentum before reaching the hill. This corresponds to having the vehicle begin at a local minimum, which results in a problem that many traditional model predictive control methods cannot solve. It is seen that, whereas open loop trajectories can lead to vehicle immobilization, SBMPC successfully uses the information provided by the dynamic model to ensure that the AGV has the requisite momentum.",18

icra,None,Rapidly-exploring Random Belief Trees for motion planning under uncertainty,"Adam Bry,Nicholas Roy,","In this paper we address the problem of motion planning in the presence of state uncertainty, also known as planning in belief space. The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efficiently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and finding low cost paths.",473

The efficiency of this approach depends however on the ability to realistically reproduce the situations encountered in the real world. If not, users could develop false perception-action loops or illusionary conjunctions. This would be detrimental for the transfer of the training to the real world. Our institute, the Lab of applied research on Software-Intensive Technologies from the French Atomic Energy Commission, CEA, LIST, is currently developing such a platform for the training of maxillo facial surgery.

Team negotiation is performed using a decentralized gradient-based optimization algorithm. Conventional approaches use finite differencing to approximate the gradient information that is computationally less efficient and exposes the gradient-based optimizer to potential numerical errors and instability. The novelty of our work is the explicit formulation of the gradient for the target search problem that significantly enhances the efficiency in gradient evaluation and robustness for the gradient-based optimization algorithm. We present results by firstly showing the computational advantage and robustness of this explicit gradient model against the finite differencing approach and further demonstrate its application in simulation by coordinating multiple UAVs searching a large scale environment in a decentralized network.,84

Four propellers are devoted to the attitude control of the robot, and two manipulators are designed for the wall-climbing and arm-operating modes. When the aerial robot works in wall-climbing and arm-operating, there are dynamics coupling between the manipulators and the main body. The dynamics of manipulators depends on the motion of the main body, and the motion of manipulators will have reaction force and torque applied on the main body. The dynamics modeling of the robot is investigated by using recursive method. Based on the model, the trajectory linearization control of the robot is proposed. The controller of the robot when it transitions between its flight mode and wall-climbing mode is then designed.

icra,None,Evolutionary tuning of sigma-point Kalman filters,"Tak Kit Lau,Kai-wun Lin,","The Kalman filter is widely used but the tedious and time-consuming tunings of the filter parameters must be unavoidably carried out before use, and frustratingly, after every reconfiguration on the sensors. In this paper, we formulated the measurement residual in a performance index, and utilised an evolutionary method to automatically and efficiently calibrate the parameters of the sigma-point Kalman filter. Without analytically resolving the nonlinear and multivariate process and measurement models in the filter, the proposed method implicitly solves for the filter parameters in a gradient-free manner through a series of strategies including the selection, crossover and shuffling mutation. Furthermore, to demonstrate the superior performance of the method, we applied this method to a highly nonlinear and coupled state estimation problem on an unmanned helicopter which experiences a GNSS outage. The empirical results showed that the proposed method not only automated and significantly accelerated the exhausting tweaking of the filter parameters, but also yielded a high quality tuning result that strikingly outperformed an earlier, painstakingly handcrafted calibration.",11

Applied with fluid driven and fluidic vacuuming, the robot can carry twice extra weight as its bodyweight on vertical climbing. As a result of motor-less design, the robot owns a unique benefit to get almost all power from the pressure of fluid working medium like water, compressed air, oil and etc., regardless of little energy supplied by internal batteries for low-power control circuit and solenoid valves.

The robot comprises two springy legs connected to a body. Leg angle and spring tension are independently controlled. The robot climbs between two parallel walls by leaping from one wall to the other. During flight, the robot stores elastic energy in its springy legs and automatically releases the energy to ""kick off"" the wall during touch down. This paper elaborates on the mechanical design of the ParkourBot. We use a simple SLIP model to simulate the ParkourBot motion and stability.

icra,None,Two level world modeling for cooperating robots using a multiple hypotheses filter,"J. Elfring,M.J.G. van de Molengraft,R.J.M. Janssen,M. Steinbuch,","Robots increasingly operate in dynamic environments and in order to operate safely, reliable world models are indispensable. A world model is the robot's view of the world and contains information about obstacle locations and velocities. A two level algorithm is proposed. It is of particular use for teams of cooperating robots and the algorithm is based on a multiple hypotheses filter. Each robot features a low level world model with a fast update rate which can be used for obstacle avoidance. The local world models are combined to one global view of the world that is shared between all robots and can be used for the implementation of team strategies. Labeling and tracking is added to the multiple hypotheses filter in order to reduce the sensitivity to track loss in case of temporary occlusions of objects or false measurements. The algorithm was extensively tested during the 2010 RoboCup Middle Size League world championships in Singapore, the results of which are presented.",11
icra,None,A novel rectification framework for coaxial omni-directional stereo,"Jie Lei,Xin Du,Jilin Liu,","Epipolar rectification greatly simplifies the stereo matching which is important for vision based robotics navigation. In this paper we propose a novel rectification algorithm for coaxial omni-directional stereo system, i.e. systems aligned on the same axis of symmetry. The essential matrix is derived and computed for an arbitrary omni-directional stereo configuration based on Taylor model firstly. Using the one-to-one corresponding relationship between epipolar curve and its tangential space, we rectify the system to the direction of the line connecting two cameras' centers. This step removes the translation misalignment. After that, the corresponding points are constraint to the radial line. Image-resample based on the essential matrix compensates the rotation misalignment and makes corresponding points lie on the same scan column. The proposed algorithm is only performed on image plane so that the computation time and error caused by multi-projections in 3D space are decreased. Finally, experimental results on simulation and real data illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithm.",1
icra,None,Autonomous river navigation using the Hamilton-Jacobi framework for underactuated vehicles,"Kevin Weekly,Leah Anderson,Andrew Tinka,Alexandre M. Bayen,","Motorized floating sensors have distinct advantages over their non-actuated counterparts. A motorized unit can prevent the sensor from washing ashore or heading into dangerous areas, expanding the mission regions in which they can be feasibly operated. In this article, we present a control frame work and describe the physically realized system used to prove its effectiveness. The controller uses two minimum-time-to-reach (MTTR) functions-one giving the time to reach the center of the river and one giving the time to reach the shoreline. The MTTR functions are constructed from solutions to Hamilton Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) Equations. Contours along these functions are used to define the state transition thresholds for an on-off controller. The first MTTR function is also used to construct the optimal bearing to travel back to the center of the river. We investigate the effectiveness of the controller using a software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulator. Using prototypes built at UC Berkeley, results from a field operational test in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta are then presented to validate the simulation results.",21

icra,None,SLAC: 3D localization of human based on kinetic human movement capture,"Qilong Yuan,I-Ming Chen,Shang Ping Lee,","This article introduces a method called SLAC (Simultaneous Localization And Capture) to track the spatial location of a human using wearable inertia sensors without additional external assistive global sensing device (e.g., camera, ultrasound, IR, etc.) The method uses multiple wearable inertia sensors to determine the orientation of the body segments and lower limb joint motions. At the same time, based on human kinematics and locomotion phase detection, the spatial position and trajectory of a reference point on the body can be determined. Preliminary experimental study has shown that the position error of SLAC can be controlled stairs within less than 2% error of the total distance travelled for a person to walk around a rectangle on the floor and climb up and down stairs. A benchmark study on the accuracy of SLAC was carried out using the camera-based Motion Analysis® system. The localization data obtained from SLAC tally well with that from the commercial system. The positioning accuracy obtained from SLAC is at least an order of magnitude better than that of GPS. Since the sensors can be worn on the human at any time and any place, this method has no restriction to indoor and outdoor applications and is complimentary to GPS applications.",40
icra,None,Better models for people tracking,"Matthias Luber,Gian Diego Tipaldi,Kai O. Arras,","People tracking is a key component for robots operating in populated environments. Previous works have employed different filtering and data association techniques for this purpose that typically rely on a set of generic assumptions on target behavior and detector characteristics. In this paper, we focus on these assumptions rather than the tracking approach itself and show that with informed models, people tracking can be made substantially more accurate without compromising efficiency. Concretely, we present better, human-specific models for the occurrence of new tracks, false alarms, track occlusions, and track deletions. In the experiments with a large-scale outdoor data set collected with a laser range finder, the models and combinations thereof are experimentally compared using a multi-hypothesis baseline tracker and the CLEAR MOT metrics. The results show how some models selectively improve tracking performance at the expense of other measures. The final combination is then able to resolve the trade-offs, leading to a reduction of data association errors by more than a factor of two at the same cost.",19
icra,None,Real-time human detection using contour cues,"Jianxin Wu,Christopher Geyer,James M. Rehg,","A real-time and accurate human detector, C 4 , is proposed in this paper. C 4 achieves 20 fps speed and state-of-the-art detection accuracy, using only one processing thread without resorting to special hardwares like GPU. Real-time accurate human detection is made possible by two contributions. First, we show that contour is exactly what we should capture and signs of comparisons among neighboring pixels are the key information to capture contours. Second, we show that the CENTRIST visual descriptor is particularly suitable for human detection, because it encodes the sign information and can implicitly represent the global contour. When CENTRIST and linear classifier are used, we propose a computational method that does not need to explicitly generate feature vectors. It involves no image pre-processing or feature vector normalization, and only requires O(1) steps to test an image patch. C 4 is also friendly to further hardware acceleration. In a robot with embedded 1.2GHz CPU, we also achieved accurate and 20 fps high speed human detection.",153

Experimental results show that the proposal is faster and less false detection than the method described in the reference [1].",11
icra,None,Adaptive fuzzy control for synchronization of nonlinear teleoperators with stochastic time-varying communication delays,"Zhijun Li,Nan Ding,Xiaoqing Cao,","In this paper, adaptive fuzzy control is investigated for nonlinear teleoperators with time-delays, which ensures synchronization of positions and velocities of the master and slave manipulators, and does not rely on the use of the scattering transformation. Compared with previous passivity framework, the communication delays are assumed to be stochastic time varying. By feedback linearization, the nonlinear dynamics of the tele-operation system is transformed into two sub systems: local master/slave position control with unmodelled dynamics and delayed motion synchronization. Then, based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and Markov jump linear systems, adaptive fuzzy control strategies are developed for the nonlinear teleoperators with time-delay, modeling uncertainties and external disturbances by using the approximation property of the fuzzy logic systems. It is proven that the master-slave tele operation system is stochastically stable in mean square under specific LMI conditions, and all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly bounded.",176

Two players located at separated places operate each haptic device to collaboratively finish the game task. Herein, a new collaboration mode of manipulation separate DOF control is proposed for the first time. Separate DOF control here means each player controls one DOF of an object or a task independently in collaborative virtual environment. Mutual guidance is also proposed which provides guidance force to each player. We setup an experiment to evaluate its efforts on cooperation performance and co-presence. Twelve participants did the experiment. The results revealed that this collaboration mode is effective.

icra,None,Passive wave variable control of haptic interaction with an unknown virtual environment,"Naser Yasrebi,Daniela Constantinescu,","The wave variable transformation cannot be exploited for the control of sampled-data and discrete-time systems without precaution. This paper shows that connecting a haptic interface to a discrete time virtual environment through a wave variable controller can inject energy into the haptic feedback loop and thus jeopardize the stability of the haptic interaction. The connection involves a one step computational delay when the virtual environment is not known prior to starting the interaction. Using the Jury-Marden stability criterion, the paper investigates the effect of this computational delay on the stability of wave variable control of haptic interaction with a virtual wall. It also develops a time domain passivity analysis to compute the energy injected in the wave variable transformation by the computational delay. Then, it proposes an algorithm for dissipating the extra energy and restoring the passivity of the wave variable transformation. The paper concludes with the experimental validation of the energy dissipating algorithm.",9
icra,None,A novel passive haptic device for simulating a broad range of impedances,"Chris A. Lightcap,Hyosig Kang,","The strength of a haptic display may be assessed from its range of stable impedances. This paper presents a novel passive haptic display (PARM) capable of simulating a broad range of impedances. It comprises a passive constraint that can simulate both uninhibited motion through free-space and collision into a rigid obstacle. In free-space, the user feels the natural impedance of the end-effector without the added inertia and friction from a transmission or actuator. In a collision with a rigid object, haptic stiffness can be much greater than a traditional impedance haptic display. An experimental study with a 2 DoF planar manipulator illustrates the minimum and maximum impedances that are attainable for this haptic display. The inertial mass and friction in free-space are less than 0.2 kg and 12.3 Ns/m, and the stiffness against a haptic boundary is 465 N/mm. In addition, collision with a haptic object produces a more authentic experience, since there are naturally-occurring high frequency oscillations that result from the physical collision between two objects. This novel haptic display has both the minimum impedance benefits of impedance haptic displays and the maximum impedance benefits of admittance haptic displays.",0

In this paper, a novel optimum assembly algorithm with ant colony algorithm is proposed to solve the maintenance assembly process for 3D objects and complex environments, and to find both optimal sequence and 3D path planning. Sequentially, the assembly sequence was optimized by a traditional ant colony optimization algorithm and then, the 3D path planning with the optimized sequence information was optimized by combining an ant colony algorithm enhanced by potential field concepts. Simulation results showed that proposed algorithm has faster convergence rate towards the optimal solution when compared with existing algorithms based on genetics and traditional ant colony approach.",13

Thus, computing manipulator Jacobians and compliance matrices efficiently is not straight forward. In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining an arc length parametrized Jacobian and compliance matrix. Our approach involves obtaining an augmented Jacobian by propagating the necessary partial derivatives through the model equations, resulting in a new set of differential equations. These equations can be solved as an initial value problem, via a single numerical integration. Our method can be generally applied to various continuum robot architectures, regardless of the specific actuation system used.

We propose a learning method that combines a least squares algorithm with a non-linear feature mapping and an efficient update rule. Using data from five different robots, we show that the method can accurately model manipulator dynamics, either when trained in batch or incrementally. Furthermore, the update time and memory usage of the method are bounded, therefore allowing use in real-time control loops.",43

The proposed mechanical closed loop structure consists of two rotary shafts and a belt-shaped elastic material which two ends are connected to one active rotary shaft and one free joint type shaft, respectively. Driving the active rotary shaft continuously, we can obtain impulsive motion by using snap-through buckling repeatedly. The change of the driving torque and the angular momentum generated snap-through buckling are shown by numerical simulations. From these results, it is shown that an offset parameter of the proposed structure is useful for generating impulsive turning motions of the compact swimming robot. The proposed mechanism is applied to a compact swimming robot which can turn impulsively at a maximum rate of 135 deg/s underwater.",7

icra,None,A novel optimal calibration algorithm on a dexterous 6 DOF serial robot-with the optimization of measurement poses number,"Tian Li,Kui Sun,Yue Jin,Hong Liu,","Normally, people always believe that the more measurement poses used in a robot calibration process, the more accurate result can be obtained. However, the accuracy improvement converges to a threshold after a number of measurement poses. Moreover, robot calibration is a time consuming process, too many poses would seriously complicate the process and consumedly increase the spending time. In this paper, an optimal measurement pose number searching method was proposed to improve the calibration method in time spending aspect. Optimal robot poses were added to an initial pose set one by one to establish a new pose set for the robot calibration. The root mean squares (RMS) of the end-effector pose errors after being calibrated by using these pose sets were calculated. The optimal number of the configuration set which correspond to the least RMS of pose error can then be obtained. This algorithm can get higher end-effector accuracy, meanwhile consume less time. The simulation on a serial robot manipulator with 24 unknown kinematic parameters shows that the end-effector pose accuracy after calibrated by the using of the optimal pose set is much better than the result before calibration, and is better than the using of a random pose set.",20
icra,None,Calibration of an eye-to-hand system using a laser pointer on hand and planar constraints,"Jwu-Sheng Hu,Yung-Jung Chang,","This work proposes a technique for calibration of an eye-to-hand system. The target of the hand-eye calibration is to estimate the geometric transformation between the hand and the eye. This calibration method further considers camera intrinsic parameters and geometric relations of a working plane in space at the same time. A laser pointer casually mounted on the hand is utilized. By manipulating the robot and projecting the laser beam on a plane of unknown orientations, a batch of related image positions of light-spots are extracted from images of the camera. Since the laser is rigidly mounted and the plane is fixed at each orientation, the geometric parameters and measurement data must obey a certain nonlinear constraints and the solutions of parameters can be estimated accordingly. A close-form solution is developed by decoupling the nonlinear equations into linear forms to compute all of the initial values. As a result, the calibration method does not need any manual initial guess of the unknown parameters. To achieve a higher accuracy, a nonlinear optimization method is implemented to refine the estimation. The advantage of using laser pointer is that this technique can be used for the case when the eye does not see the hand. Experimental results of simulations and real data are presented to show the validity and the simple requirements of the proposed algorithm.",18
icra,None,Error analysis and flexibility compensation of a cable-driven humanoid-arm manipulator,"Quanzhu Chen,Weihai Chen,Rong Liu,Jianbin Zhang,","Kinematic calibration is an effective method for improving the accuracy of the robot motion control. For the cable-driven robot, the flexibility of the cable makes the robot have good compliance and meet safety requirements; however, it brings a greater influence on the movement accuracy of the mechanism. Thus, kinematic calibration alone cannot accurately establish the error model. In view of the error analysis and flexibility compensation of the cable-driven robot, this paper analyzes the effect of flexible rope on kinematic movement accuracy by introducing a flexibility compensation weighting factor. A kind of comprehensive error analysis model of the cable-driven robot was established. By using kinematic calibration algorithm, it organically merges together the kinematic errors caused by the geometric parameters errors and that caused by flexibility of cable. With shoulder joint of the cable-driven humanoid-arm manipulator as the experimental object, the results showed that the algorithm has a better convergence, and it can effectively improve the accuracy of the robot motion control.",6

Moreover, it does not scale computationally to large sets of data, requiring O(N 3 ) operations per iteration. We present a GraphSLAM-like algorithm for signal strength SLAM. Our algorithm shares many of the benefits of Gaussian processes, yet is viable for a broader range of environments since it makes no signature uniqueness assumptions.

Here we develop the first model of contact dynamics defined in both the forward and inverse directions. The contact impulse is the solution to a convex optimization problem: minimize kinetic energy in contact space subject to non-penetration and friction-cone constraints. We use a custom interior-point method to make the optimization problem unconstrained; this is key to defining the forward and inverse dynamics in a consistent way. The resulting model has a parameter which sets the amount of contact smoothing, facilitating continuation methods for optimization.

icra,None,New dry friction model with load- and velocity-dependence and dynamic identification of multi-DOF robots,"P. Hamon,M. Gautier,P. Garrec,","Usually, the joint transmission friction model for robots is composed of a viscous friction force and of a constant dry sliding friction force. However, according to the Coulomb law, the dry friction force depends linearly on the load driven by the transmission, which has to be taken into account for robots working with large variation of the payload or inertial and gravity forces. Moreover, for robots actuating at low velocity, the Stribeck effect must be taken into account. This paper proposes a new inverse dynamic identification model for n degrees of freedom (dof) serial robot, where the dry sliding friction force is a linear function of both the dynamic and the external forces, with a velocity-dependent coefficient. A new sequential identification procedure is carried out. At a first step, the friction model parameters are identified for each joint (1 dof), moving one joint at a time (this step has been validated in). At a second step, these values are fixed in the n dof dynamic model for the identification of all robot inertial and gravity parameters. For the two steps, the identification concatenates all the joint data collected while the robot is tracking planned trajectories with different payloads to get a global least squares estimation of inertial and new friction parameters. An experimental validation is carried out with an industrial 3 dof robot.",30

However legged robots such as humanoids are inherently different as they are underactuated and subject to switching external contact constraints. Recently several methods have been proposed to create inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers for these robots. In an attempt to compare these different approaches, we develop a general framework for inverse dynamics control and show that these methods lead to very similar controllers.

Soueres,","In this paper, we propose a solution to compute full-dynamic motions for a humanoid robot, accounting for various kinds of constraints such as dynamic balance or joint limits. As a first step, we propose a unification of task-based control schemes, in inverse kinematics or inverse dynamics. Based on this unification, we generalize the cascade of quadratic programs that were developed for inverse kinematics only. Then, we apply the solution to generate, in simulation, whole-body motions for a humanoid robot in unilateral contact with the ground, while ensuring the dynamic balance on a non horizontal surface.",56
icra,None,Wearable tactile keypad with stretchable artificial skin,"Rebecca K. Kramer,Carmel Majidi,Robert J. Wood,","A hyperelastic, thin, transparent pressure sensitive keypad is fabricated by embedding a silicone rubber film with conductive liquid-filled microchannels. Applying pressure to the surface of the elastomer deforms the cross-section of underlying microchannels and changes the electrical resistance across the affected channels. Perpendicular conductive channels form a quasi-planar network within an elastomeric matrix that registers the location, intensity and duration of applied pressure. Pressing channel intersections of the keypad triggers one of twelve keys, allowing the user to write any combination of alphabetic letters. A 5% change in channel output voltage must be achieved to trigger a key. It is found that approximately 100 kPa of pressure is necessary to produce a 5% change in voltage across a conductive microchannel that is 20 microns in height and 200 microns in width. Sensitivity of the keypad is tunable via channel geometry and choice of elastomeric material.",156

The first approach that is presented combines filtered dynamic equations with a recursive least squares estimation algorithm to provide a smoothened force signal, which is useful in the (common) case of noisy torque measurements. The second approach, which uses a generalized momentum based disturbance observer, is mainly discussed to compare it to the first approach. Although very different in appearance, it is shown that a close connection exists between both approaches. Simulation results for both algorithms are shown, and experimental results derived from a sensorless admittance controller that was implemented using the algorithms are presented.",82
icra,None,Fingertip force and contact position and orientation sensor,"Yu Sun,",This paper presents a novel integrated system that is composed of a fingerprint sensor and a force sensor to measure contact position and orientation of the fingertip along with the contact force. The system uses fingerprints from the fingerprint sensor to identify the contact position and orientation with fingerprint features such as core point and ridge orientations. The contact position and orientation are represented in a fingerpad coordinate system for grasping studies. An experiment has been designed to evaluate the proposed system in terms of accuracy and resolution with three subjects. The proposed system can be used in human grasping studies to characterize the fingerpad contact.,5
icra,None,Finger-shaped thermal sensor using thermo-sensitive paint and camera for telexistence,"Katsunari Sato,Hiroyuki Shinoda,Susumu Tachi,","A thermal change on a fingertip is essential for haptic perception. We have proposed a vision-based thermal sensor using thermo-sensitive paint and a CCD camera for telexistence. The thermo-sensitive paint is employed to measure thermal information on the basis of its color, which changes according to its temperature. The proposed sensor can simulate the physical interaction between a human fingertip and an object in order to measure surface thermal information correctly. Furthermore, because the proposed sensor can be easily integrated with our vision-based force sensor, a comprehensive measurement device for measuring haptic information can be realized. In this study, we constructed a prototype of the proposed thermal sensor and experimentally confirmed that this sensor could measure surface thermal information.",14
icra,None,Robot-facilitated scanning and co-registration of multi-modal and multi-level sensing: Demonstration with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy,"Ahmet E. Sonmez,Alpay Özcan,William M. Spees,Nikolaos V. Tsekos,","Robotic manipulators have emerged and are continuously evolving as a valuable tool in medical applications. This work introduces a new biomedical application for robotics: multimodality imaging by facilitating scanning of spatially localized bio-sensing and co-registration. Established or currently emerging molecular and near cellular modalities, such as optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, offer new opportunities for assessing tissue pathophysiology in situ. The limited tissue penetration of those modalities can be addressed by locally placing the sensor, i.e. with a minimally invasive trans-needle or trans-catheter approach. Herein, we describe the use of a robotic manipulator to scan the area of interest by carrying such a sensor for generating 1-D scans while registering them to a guiding modality. The approach is demonstrated by using a miniature RF coil for collecting proton MR spectra (MRS) and scanning an area of interest on phantoms with the manipulator. MRI is used to guide this procedure as well as co-register MR imaging and spectroscopy. LineScans on two compartment phantoms demonstrated a clear spatial distribution of the resonances originating from those compartments in agreement with the scout guiding MR images. The system described herein, is a generalized platform for performing MR-guided multimodality and multilevel sensing.",4
icra,None,Friction modeling in concentric tube robots,"Jesse Lock,Pierre E. Dupont,","Concentric tube robots are a novel class of continuum robots that are constructed by combining pre curved elastic tubes such that the overall shape of the robot is a function of the relative rotations and translations of the constituent tubes. Frictionless kinematic and quasistatic force models for this class of robots have been developed that incorporate bending and twisting of the tubes. Experimental evaluation of these models has revealed, however, a directional dependence of tube rotation on robot shape that is not predicted by these models. To explain this behavior, this paper models the contributions of friction arising from two sources: the distributed forces of contact between the tubes along their length and the concentrated bending moments generated at discontinuities in curvature and at the boundaries. It is shown that while friction due to distributed forces is insufficient to explain the experimentally observed tube twisting, a simple model of frictional torque arising from concentrated moments provides a good match with the experimental data.",76

The device features an articulated distal tip with seven independently controllable degrees-of-freedom (DoF), arranged as two universal joints (intersecting pitch and yaw) and three single DoF joints (yaw only); two Ø3mm internal channels, one for an on-board camera for visualization and the other for passing interventional instruments. The design allows the robot to explore the entire peritoneal cavity from a chosen single incision point.

icra,None,Towards a MR image-guided SMA-actuated neurosurgical robot,"Mingyen Ho,Michael Koltz,J. Marc Simard,Rao Gullapalli,Jaydev P. Desai,","We present our work towards the development of a MR image-guided SMA-actuated neurosurgical robot. We used two antagonistic SMA wires as actuators for each joint in the robot, so that each joint can be actuated independently. We also modeled and tested the force behaviour of SMA wires in the bent configuration, which can be used as a guideline for SMA actuator selection. Due to the size scale of the robot, it is impossible to have individual position sensors at each joint and hence we rely primarily on vision feedback to control the joint motion of the robot. The images used to control the robot in this paper were obtained from a camera with the goal of eventually using MR images to control the end-effector motion. We then developed a control strategy and a switching circuit to control multiple links simultaneously and independently using only one power supply. Experimental results from our current prototype of a 3-DOF robot showed that we can actuate the robot and hence observe joint motion in a gelatin slab. We also did a series of experiments inside the MRI to show that the robot is fully MRI-compatible and creates no significant image distortion in the MR images.",14

In this paper a system is proposed that estimates the self-motion and wind velocity by fusing information from airspeed sensors, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a monocular camera. Such estimates can be used in control systems for managing wind disturbances or chemical plume based tracking strategies. Simulation results indicate that while the inertial dead-reckoning process is subject to drift, the system is capable of separating the self-motion and wind velocity from the airspeed information.",25

Moreover, the road appearance is often affected by a number of factors in challenging conditions. In this paper, we present an adaptive non-planar road detection and tracking approach which overcomes these difficulties by a piecewise planar road model as well as a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based alternating optimization using belief propagation (BP) on segmented images and a hard conditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to achieve adaptability and optimality.

icra,None,Scenario and context specific visual robot behavior learning,"Krishna Kumar Narayanan,Luis Felipe Posada,Frank Hoffmann,Torsten Bertram,","The design of visual robotic behaviors constitutes a substantial challenge. It requires to draw meaningful relation ships and constraints between the acquired visual perception and the geometry of the environment both empirically and programmatically. This contribution proposes a novel robot learning framework to classify and acquire scenario specific autonomous behaviors through demonstration. During demonstration, robocentric 3D range and omnidirectional images are recorded as training instances of typical robot navigation situations pertaining to different contexts in multiple indoor scenarios. A programming by demonstration approach generalizes the demonstrated trajectories to a general mapping between visual features extracted from the omnidirectional image onto a corresponding robot motion. The approach is able to distinguish among different traversing scenarios and further identifies the best matching context within the scenario to predict an appropriate robot motion. As a comparison to context matching, the behaviors are trained by means of an artificial neural network and its generalization ability is evaluated against the former. The experimental validation on the mobile robot indicates that the acquired visual behavior is robust and generalizes meaningful actions beyond the specific environments and scenarios presented during training.",12
icra,None,Robust recognition of planar mirrored walls using a single view,"Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi,Dezhen Song,",We report a method for the detection and recognition of a large planar mirror based on the images captured by a monocular camera. We start with deriving a mirror transformation matrix in a homogeneous coordinate and geometric constraints for corresponding real and virtual feature points in the image. We find that existing feature detection methods are not reflection invariant. We introduce a secondary artificial reflection to virtual features to generate secondary features which are proven to share a rigid body motion relationship with the original feature set. We propose an iterative strategy to adjust the secondary mirror configuration so that existing feature matching methods can be used. The combined method yields a robust mirror detection algorithm which has been verified in physical experiments.,10

icra,None,Towards joint attention for a domestic service robot - person awareness and gesture recognition using Time-of-Flight cameras,"David Droeschel,Jörg Stückler,Dirk Holz,Sven Behnke,","Joint attention between a human user and a robot is essential for effective human-robot interaction. In this work, we propose an approach to person awareness and to the perception of showing and pointing gestures for a domestic service robot. In contrast to previous work, we do not require the person to be at a predefined position, but instead actively approach and orient towards the communication partner. For perceiving showing and pointing gestures and for estimating the pointing direction a Time-of-Flight camera is used. Estimated pointing directions and shown objects are matched to objects in the robot's environment. Both the perception of showing and pointing gestures as well as the accurary of estimated pointing directions have been evaluated in a set of different experiments. The results show that both gestures are adequatly perceived by the robot. Furthermore, our system achieves a higher accuracy in estimating the pointing direction than is reported in the literature for a stereo-based system. In addition, the overall system has been successfully tested in two international RoboCup@Home competitions and the 2010 ICRA Mobile Manipulation Challenge.",52

The extensive hobbyist community has tended to focus on the hardware and the low-level software aspects. We claim that there is a need for a low-cost, general-purpose robot, accessible to the hobbyist community, with sufficient computation and sensing to run “research-grade” software. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of such a robot. We explicitly outline our design goals, and show how a capable robot can be assembled from off-the-shelf parts, for a modest cost, by a single person with only a few tools. We also show how the robot can be used as a low-cost telepresence platform, giving the system a concrete purpose beyond being a low-cost development platform.",34

The model, called spatial affordance map, is a non-homogeneous spatial Poisson process that relates space, time and occurrence probability of activity events. We describe how learning and inference is made and present a novel planning algorithm that produces paths which maximize the probability to encounter a person. We show that the problem is a special class of the orienteering problem that can be solved as a finite horizon Markov decision process. We develop a simulator of populated office environments to validate the model and the planning algorithm. The simulated agents follow activity patterns learned by administering a questionnaire to 27 colleagues over two weeks. The experiments shows that the model is statistically valid with respect to both the Anderson-Darling test and the expected waiting time estimation. They further show that the proposed algorithm is able to find optimal paths.",39

icra,None,Zero-moment point feedback balance control of leg-wheel hybrid structures by using dynamic decoupling and control allocation,"Sang-ik An,Dong-Soo Kwon,","This paper proposes a balance control algorithm which uses Zero Moment Point (ZMP) in order to improve the mobility of leg-wheel hybrid structures on hard, flat surfaces. The algorithm generates balancing leg motions which continuously adjust the contact points to allow the geometric center of the contact area to follow ZMP. During our simulation of a balance control system which uses Individual Joint PD Control (IJPD), we encountered two main problems-high frequency oscillation and unbalanced control input. To solve these issues, we derived a method for dynamic decoupling and control allocation (DDCA). We tested the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by simulating the maximum distance that a robot can stably move during a fixed time period. There are three important advantages to our proposed balance control algorithm. First, the balancing motions have no effect on the primary tasks of its arms and upper body. Second, the interaction forces between the contact points are minimized, thereby reducing an unbalance of the control inputs. Third, the task dynamics are decoupled and controlled independently.",7

However, despite growing interest in leg compliance within the robotics literature, little experimental work has been reported on tunable passive leg compliance in running machines. In this paper we present an empirical study into the role of leg compliance using a composite tunable leg design implemented on our dynamic hexapod, EduBot, with gaits optimized for running speed using a range of leg stiffnesses, on two different surface stiffnesses, and with two different payload configurations (0 kg and 0.91 kg). We found that leg stiffness, surface compliance, and payload had a significant impact on the robot's final optimized speed and efficiency. These results document the value and efficacy of what we believe is the first autonomous dynamic legged robot capable of runtime leg stiffness adjustment.",64

icra,None,Self-supervised obstacle detection for humanoid navigation using monocular vision and sparse laser data,"Daniel Maier,Maren Bennewitz,Cyrill Stachniss,","In this paper, we present an approach to obstacle detection for collision-free, efficient humanoid robot navigation based on monocular images and sparse laser range data. To detect arbitrary obstacles in the surroundings of the robot, we analyze 3D data points obtained from a 2D laser range finder installed in the robot's head. Relying only on this laser data, however, can be problematic. While walking, the floor close to the robot's feet is not observable by the laser sensor, which inherently increases the risk of collisions, especially in nonstatic scenes. Furthermore, it is time-consuming to frequently stop walking and tilting the head to obtain reliable information about close obstacles. We therefore present a technique to train obstacle detectors for images obtained from a monocular camera also located in the robot's head. The training is done online based on sparse laser data in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach projects the obstacles identified from the laser data into the camera image and learns a classifier that considers color and texture information. While the robot is walking, it then applies the learned classifiers to the images to decide which areas are traversable. As we illustrate in experiments with a real humanoid, our approach enables the robot to reliably avoid obstacles during navigation. Furthermore, the results show that our technique leads to significantly more efficient navigation compared to extracting obstacles solely based on 3D laser range data acquired while the robot is standing at certain intervals.",37

This paper discusses the transition issue among multiple tasks on how the transition can be effectively and smoothly achieved. The proposed approach is to compose intermediate desired values to smooth the transitions rather than to modify control laws. The approach can be practically used on robotic systems without modification on their specific control algorithms. In this paper, multi-points control and joint limit avoidance are performed as applications of the proposed approach.",13

The robot interacts with a changing environment, and the input torques are different depending on whether the robot performs tasks in a constrained state (e.g. in contact) or not. We develop a solution with smooth weights variations and transitional tasks which avoids sharp torque evolutions.

Introduced is a method to adapt the observation model of a particle filter, to identify partial and full occlusions of a person, to determine the amount of occlusion behind an obstacle, and the occluding obstacle itself. This is done by tracing rays from positions near the person to the sensor and determining whether the ray hits an obstacle. The laser range data is represented using a voxel grid, which facilitates efficient retrieval and data reduction. As our experiments show, our proposed tracking approach is able to reliably keep track of a person in real-time, even when only partially visible, when moving in uneven terrain, or when the person passes closely another person of different size.",14
icra,None,Tracking people in 3D using a bottom-up top-down detector,"Luciano Spinello,Matthias Luber,Kai O. Arras,","People detection and tracking is a key component for robots and autonomous vehicles in human environments. While prior work mainly employed image or 2D range data for this task, in this paper, we address the problem using 3D range data. In our approach, a top-down classifier selects hypotheses from a bottom-up detector, both based on sets of boosted features. The bottom-up detector learns a layered person model from a bank of specialized classifiers for different height levels of people that collectively vote into a continuous space. Modes in this space represent detection candidates that each postulate a segmentation hypothesis of the data. In the top-down step, the candidates are classified using features that are computed in voxels of a boosted volume tessellation. We learn the optimal volume tessellation as it enables the method to stably deal with sparsely sampled and articulated objects. We then combine the detector with tracking in 3D for which we take a multi-target multi-hypothesis tracking approach. The method neither needs a ground plane assumption nor relies on background learning. The results from experiments in populated urban environments demonstrate 3D tracking and highly robust people detection up to 20 m with equal error rates of at least 93%.",116

Typical teleoperation system dynamics, however, posses terms with nonlinearly parameterized (NLP) structures. Stribeck friction is an example of NLP terms in robot dynamics. If not compensated for in the control scheme, uncertainties in the NLP dynamic terms may lead to significant tracking errors. In this paper, for a bilateral teleoperation system, adaptive controllers are designed for the master and slave robots with both LP and NLP dynamic uncertainties. Next, these controllers are incorporated into the 4-channel bilateral teleoperation framework. Then, transparency of the overall teleoperation is studied via a Lyapunov function analysis.

icra,None,Comparison between two mixed reality environments as a teleoperation interface,"Ida Bagus Kerthyayana Manuaba,Ken Taylor,Tom Gedeon,","An important aspect of teleoperation is situational awareness through visualization. The actual operation and control of a remote machine must be supported by an interface which provides enough information through visualization from a remote location to complete a task. This can be achieved with a Mixed Reality (MR) environment. The concept is to combine information from the real world and a virtual world. An experiment was conducted to assess the differences between two platforms and to determine interface features required to maximize operator performance and satisfaction. The result indicates that both mixed reality environments tested were suitable for teleoperation where sufficient information to perform the task could be modeled in the virtual world. However, one of the environments turned out to be superior where the task required information in the video but not modeled in the virtual environment.

But humans also continually adjust impedance during contact and throughout manipulation tasks. We examine the value and effect of continual impedance variation on quasi-static manipulation. We approach this challenge from the perspective of telerobotics where the operator can explicitly modulate the robotic impedance. Using a three degree of freedom planar teleoperation system we explore two quasi-static tasks: inserting a rigid peg into a tight hole and throwing a switch without overshoot. The work finds that no single impedance can optimally accomplish both tasks. Instead user-controlled impedance variations achieve the desired results, demonstrating the benefits of variable impedance to quasi-static applications in telerobotics.",20
icra,None,Adaptive frequency differentiation: An approach to increase the transparency and performance of haptic devices,"Kamran Ghaffari Toiserkan,József Kövecses,Paul Karam,","There are many applications for which a robotic device is used to recreate the sense of touch for a physical or virtual environment. Transparency and stability are two major issues in controlling haptic devices. Transparency highly depends on the quality of state observation while the stability range is mainly affected by the time-delay and sampling frequency. The control force is calculated based on the model of the environment and usually is a function of the position and the velocity at the joints. Optical encoders are commonly used for position measurement because of their high resolution, robustness to noise, and high bandwidth. The velocity, however, is usually determined by differentiating the position data over time which can be noisy at high frequencies. This noise demotes the transparency and stability. Low-pass filters are widely used to filter the noise but they make the system slow and conservatively introduce time-delay which further limits the stability range. In this paper, the method of Adaptive Frequency Differentiation (AFD) is introduced, which operates at varying frequencies and effectively removes the noise caused by the error in position data. The AFD is optimized to operate at its best performance while maintaining the reliability of the differentiation. The output of the AFD is derived by logically interpreting the available data and does not involve iterative loops, which improves the processing time. An extension to this method allows to compute low-delay and noiseless acceleration directly from the position data. The claims of this paper are supported by simulation and experimental results.",4

Restrictions are carefully applied on contact area spreading so that vibration will be the only factor that would induce a sensation. A vibrotactile device was excited at constant frequency and its amplitude is adjusted at different levels to alter the amount of skin displacement. Volunteers participated in a two-alternative force choice experiment were ask to compare the perceived softness difference between voice coil and silicone rubber. Statistical analysis on the responses of participants showed a decline of spring constant. It was interesting to note, that even though contact area was significantly restrained participants were still able to discriminate softness sensation form vibrotactile stimulation. Such observation possibly shows that illusion of contact area spread rate can be reproduced by vibrotactile stimulation.",14
icra,None,Quadrupedal bounding with an actuated spinal joint,"Utku Çulha,Uluç Saranli,","Most legged vertebrates use flexible spines and supporting muscles to provide auxiliary power and dexterity for dynamic behaviors, resulting in higher speeds and additional maneuverability during locomotion. However, most existing legged robots capable of dynamic locomotion incorporate only a single rigid trunk with actuation limited to legs and associated joints. In this paper, we investigate how quadrupedal bounding can be achieved in the presence of an actuated spinal joint and characterize associated performance improvements compared to bounding with a rigid robot body. In the context of both a new controller structure for bounding with a body joint and existing bounding controllers for the rigid trunk, we use optimization methods to identify the highest performance gait parameters and establish that the spinal joint allows increased forward speeds and hopping heights.",73
icra,None,Granular lift forces predict vertical motion of a sand-swimming robot,"Ryan D. Maladen,Paul B. Umbanhowar,Yang Ding,Andrew Masse,,","Previously we modeled the undulatory subsurface locomotion of the sandfish lizard with a sand-swimming robot which displayed performance comparable to the organism. In this work we control the lift forces on the robot by varying its head shape and demonstrate that these granular forces predict the vertical motion of the robot. Inspired by the tapered head of the sandfish lizard, we drag a wedge shaped object horizontally and parallel to its lower face through a granular medium and show that by varying the angle of the upper leading surface of the wedge, α, the lift force can be varied from positive to negative. Testing the robot with these wedges as heads results in vertical motion in the same direction as the lift force in the drag experiments. As the robot moves forward, the force on its head normal to the body plane results in a net torque imbalance which pitches the robot causing it to rise or sink within the medium. Since repeatedly varying α for a wedge head to achieve a desired lift is impractical, we test robot heads that approximate a wedge head inclined at varying angles by changing the angle of the bottom and top surfaces of the wedge, and show that similar lift control is achieved. Our results provide principles for the construction of robots that will be able to follow arbitrary trajectories within complex substrates like sand, and also lend support to hypotheses that morphological adaptations of desert-dwelling organisms aid in their subsurface locomotion.",18
icra,None,Robotic arm control inspired by human muscle tension effect under the gravity,"Ji-Hun Bae,Woosung Yang,Doik Kim,Yonghwan Oh,Bum-Jae You,,","In recent, control approaches for the human-like behavior in the field of service robotics have been attracting considerable attention, since most humans or animals perform various tasks uncomplicatedly. Hence simple control methods based on gaining a physical insight into human reaching movement in redundancy of DOFs have been proposed. In comparison with the conventional approaches, the proposed method tries to control directly robotic systems in task-space with the control signal composed of linear superposition of three terms 1) joint-damping, 2) virtual spring, and 3) virtual damper in task-space. In particular, our work contains a muscle tension effect of a human under the gravity. This give birth to energy efficient natural motions avoiding problems on repeatability of the motion and ill-posedness problems emerged in most of redundant DOF systems. Thus, this paper exhibits expendability of the position control into the orientation control and compliant behavior. It is verified with a real robotic arm that satisfies human-like movements and motion repeatability under kinematic redundancy of joints.",21
icra,None,Analysis of the 1-Joint Spring-Motor Coupling System and optimization criteria focusing on the velocity increasing effect,"Takatoshi Hondo,Ikuo Mizuuchi,","This paper describes analysis and design criteria of the 1-Joint Spring-Motor Coupling System (SMCS). A system including series elastic elements shows vibrational responses in the velocity space, and our concept is to use the velocity peak of the system for motions that need explosive power. By tuning parameters, we can obtain instantaneously higher velocity than without any spring. We constructed a mathematical model of a 1-Joint SMCS (including motor electrical properties) and confirmed the velocity increasing effect on SMCS by numerical analyses and real experiments. And we discovered existence of the most effective inertia balance between the motor shaft and the robot link, and proposed the optimum spring constant with consideration of the moveable range of the link. We confirmed the validity and the limitation of the criteria by the real experiments.",20
icra,None,On the potential field-based control of the MIT-Skywalker,"Panagiotis K. Artemiadis,Hermano Igo Krebs,","Walking impairments are a common sequela of neurological injury, severely affecting the quality of life of both adults and children. Gait therapy is the traditional approach to ameliorate the problem by re-training the nervous system and there have been some attempts to mechanize such approach. We have recently presented the MIT-Skywalker; a novel device to deliver gait therapy, which, in contrast to previous approaches, takes advantage of the concept of passive walkers and the natural dynamics of the lower extremity in order to deliver more ""ecological"" therapy. In this paper we present a control scheme for the MIT-Skywalker, which is based on an artificial potential field applied at the foot workspace. It is used to improve sensory feedback to the patient, as well as to increase to normal the range of motion of the paretic leg. Simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed controller.",6
icra,None,Muscle fatigue tracking based on stimulus evoked EMG and adaptive torque prediction,"Qin Zhang,Mitsuhiro Hayashibe,David Guiraud,","Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is effective to restore movement in spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects. Unfortunately, muscle fatigue constrains the application of FES so that output torque feedback is interesting for fatigue compensation. Whereas, inadequacy of torque sensors is another challenge for FES control. Torque estimation is thereby essential in fatigue tracking task for practical FES employment. In this work, the Hammstein cascade with electromyography (EMG) as input is applied to model the myoelectrical mechanical behavior of the stimulated muscle. Kalman filter with forgetting factor is presented to estimate the muscle model and track fatigue. Fatigue inducing protocol was conducted on three SCI subjects through surface electrical stimulation. Assessment in simulation and with experimental data reveals that the muscle model properly fits the muscle behavior well. Moreover, the time-varying parameters tracking performance in simulation is efficient such that real time tracking is feasible with Kalman filter. The fatigue tracking with experimental data further demonstrates that the proposed method is suitable for fatigue tracking as well as adaptive torque prediction at different prediction horizons.",14
icra,None,Stiffness adjustment of a Series Elastic Actuator in an ankle-foot prosthesis for walking and running: The trade-off between energy and peak power optimization,"Martin Grimmer,André Seyfarth,","During walking and running, passive foot prostheses can only do positive work by releasing elastic energy stored in compliant structures. This limited ability to generate positive work can be improved in devices which actively support the push-off. Here, we estimate the peak power and energy requirements of a simulated serial elastic actuator (SEA) for walking and running and compare it with a direct drive setup. The simulations indicate that a serial spring can highly reduce peak power and the energy. Results suggest that optimizing SEA stiffness to obtain minimal peak power is the more general approach as it needs similar energy requirements as observed in optimizing for minimal energy. In contrast, optimization for minimal energy results in clearly higher peak power requirements. For both gaits, the predicted optimal spring stiffness suitable for minimizing peak power increases with speed. For optimizing energy, the stiffness decreases with walking speed and remains nearly constant across speeds in running. A constant stiffness for both gaits is possible. It should be chosen based on the optimized peak power solution for the highest desired speed, where the peak power requirements are most critical.",42

The driving motors are a major source of power consumption. In this paper, we study the problem of finding velocity profiles for car-like robots so as to minimize the energy consumed while traveling along a given path. We start with an established model for energy consumption of DC motors. We present closed form solutions for the unconstrained case and for the case where there is a bound on maximum velocity. We also study a general problem where the robot's path is composed of segments (e.g. circular arcs and line segments). We are given a velocity bound for each segment. For this problem, we present a dynamic programming solution which uses the solution for the single-constraint case as a subroutine. In addition, we present a calibration method to find model parameters. Finally, we present results from experiments conducted on a custom-built robot.",44
icra,None,Planning curvature-constrained paths to multiple goals using circle sampling,"Edgar Lobaton,Jinghe Zhang,Sachin Patil,Ron Alterovitz,","We present a new sampling-based method for planning optimal, collision-free, curvature-constrained paths for nonholonomic robots to visit multiple goals in any order. Rather than sampling configurations as in standard sampling based planners, we construct a roadmap by sampling circles of constant curvature and then generating feasible transitions between the sampled circles. We provide a closed-form formula for connecting the sampled circles in 2D and generalize the approach to 3D workspaces. We then formulate the multi goal planning problem as finding a minimum directed Steiner tree over the roadmap. Since optimally solving the multi-goal planning problem requires exponential time, we propose greedy heuristics to efficiently compute a path that visits multiple goals. We apply the planner in the context of medical needle steering where the needle tip must reach multiple goals in soft tissue, a common requirement for clinical procedures such as biopsies, drug delivery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. We demonstrate that our multi-goal planner significantly decreases tissue that must be cut when compared to sequential execution of single-goal plans.",18

It operates on detailed, continuous geometric representations and does not require a-priori discretization of the state or action spaces.",0
icra,None,Anytime Motion Planning using the RRT*,"Sertac Karaman,Matthew R. Walter,Alejandro Perez,Emilio Frazzoli,,","The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, based on incremental sampling, efficiently computes motion plans. Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor ""anytime"" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods. We also demonstrate experimental results for an outdoor wheeled robotic vehicle.",649
icra,None,Cooperative visual mapping in a heterogeneous team of mobile robots,"Marius Hofmeister,Marcel Kronfeld,Andreas Zell,","Mapping is regarded as one of the most fundamental tasks for mobile robots. In this work, we present an approach that enables multiple resource-limited mobile robots to cooperatively build an image-based map of the environment and to afterwards localize in it. To achieve this, we deploy a hierarchical team of mobile robots. A parent robot possesses state-of-the-art sensors, computation power and acts as a leader. It teleoperates small child robots within its line-of-sight. In contrast to other approaches and due to the cooperation among the robots, we can relax the requirement that every robot must be able to self-localize to take part in multi-robot mapping. Additionally, our algorithm ensures the mapping of the entire area in an efficient way, i.e., it fulfills the requirements of area coverage. To test our approach, extensive experiments have been performed both in simulation and real-world. In the latter case, a team of four heterogeneous mobile robots was deployed. Besides the successful cooperation in the robot team, localization results are presented to validate the applicability of the proposed mapping procedure.",8

A line-based partial 3D map was built, in which many structural properties of the environment can be included. The vertical line and the floor line can be represented as simple 2D objects in the floor plane. These two heterogeneous types of line features were developed as independent SLAM features and combined to represent the environment in a more complete fashion. Although the vertical and floor line use different parameterization and initialization methods, their measurement models are integrated into a unified EKF framework. Experimental results show that this method is practical in a structured indoor environment.",36
icra,None,Real-time outline mapping for mobile blind robots,"Juan Liu,Ying Zhang,","Mapping is important for mobile robots in unknown environments. However, existing work largely relies on long-range sensors such as expensive laser range finders and cameras. Little has been done for robots with only short-range sensors such as bumpers or wall sensors. In this paper, we fill in the gap and propose a method for real-time indoor mapping for blind robots, i.e. robots that have only short-range sensors. Several key problems for mapping are addressed in this paper: (1) generating map from a single robot's odometry and short-range sensor data, (2) combining and collating maps from multiple robots to generate a coherent bigger map, and (3) detecting loops in the map and performing loop closure. The method has been implemented on iRobot Create and tested in hallways of office buildings. Experimental results have shown that the system is robust to noisy odometry and obstacles along the walls.",7
icra,None,Color point cloud registration with 4D ICP algorithm,"Hao Men,Biruk Gebre,Kishore Pochiraju,","This paper presents methodologies to accelerate the registration of 3D point cloud segments by using hue data from the associated imagery.

A k-d tree based nearest neighbor search is used to associated common points in {x, y, z, hue} 4D space. The unknown rigid translation and rotation matrix required for registration is iteratively solved using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method. A mobile robot mounted scanner was used to generate color point cloud segments over a large area. The 4D ICP registration has been compared with typical 3D ICP and numerical results on the generated map segments shows that the 4D method resolves ambiguity in registration and converges faster than the 3D ICP.",117

Kyriakopoulos,","This paper presents a solution to the robust practical stabilization of a unicycle-like marine vehicle, under non vanishing current-induced perturbations. A hysteresis-based switching control strategy is proposed, rendering the system globally practically stable to a set G around the origin. The control scheme consists of three control laws; the first one is active out of G and drives the system trajectories into G, based on a dipole-like vector field. The other two control laws are active in G and alternately regulate the position and the orientation of the vehicle. The system is shown to be robust, in the sense that the vehicle enters and remains into G even if only a maximum bound of the perturbation is known. The efficacy of the solution is demonstrated through simulation results.",11

icra,None,A compact underwater vehicle using high-bandwidth coanda-effect valves for low speed precision maneuvering in cluttered environments,"Anirban Mazumdar,H. Harry Asada,","A highly maneuver able, compact vehicle for underwater precision inspection of complex structures is presented. The vehicle will have no appendages such as rudders, screws, and other external thrusters, which might get tangled and interfere with the underwater structure in a cluttered environment. A multi-axis, integrated thruster mechanism using Coanda-effect high-speed valves for switching the direction of jets can be encapsulated in a compact, egg-shaped body. Compared to traditional screw thrusters, these valves have improved dynamic performance in switching the jet stream direction. Furthermore, the reaction forces and moments due to switching can be substantially reduced. First, the principle of Coanda effect water jet valves is introduced, and its governing equations are obtained. Optimal dimensions and parameters producing a maximum of thrust are obtained, and are experimentally verified. Multiple Coanda-effect valves are then integrated into a tree structure to create a multi-axis thrust mechanism. A simple planar proof of concept prototype is built and tested.",19
icra,None,Autonomous navigation of in-pipe working robot in unknown pipeline environment,"Dong-Hyuk Lee,Hyungpil Moon,Hyouk Ryeol Choi,","In this paper, we present the autonomous pipeline navigation method of an in-pipe robot, based on the landmark recognition system and 3D orientation sensor. The fittings of pipelines such as elbows and branches can be used as the landmarks. In this paper, we introduce a noise tolerant landmark detection method using a line laser beam projected on the internal surface of the pipeline. Once the line laser is projected on the surface of landmarks, a unique line pattern is generated. By using this line pattern, the robot can easily detect and distinguish these landmarks while recognizing the direction of the pipeline path. Simultaneously, the robot's pose information from the orientation sensor and the driving motor's encoder is continuously recorded and used to reconstruct a map of the pipelines. By using this map and a specific navigation strategy, the robot can navigate in the 3D pipeline autonomously. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments using the in-pipe robot called MRINSPECT V.",40

icra,None,Real-time volume estimation of a dragline payload,"Alex Bewley,Rajiv Shekhar,Sam Leonard,Ben Upcroft,Paul Lever,","This paper presents a method for measuring the in-bucket payload volume on a dragline excavator for the purpose of estimating the material's bulk density in real-time. Knowledge of the payload's bulk density can provide feedback to mine planning and scheduling to improve blasting and therefore provide a more uniform bulk density across the excavation site. This allows a single optimal bucket size to be used for maximum overburden removal per dig and in turn reduce costs and emissions in dragline operation and maintenance. The proposed solution uses a range bearing laser to locate and scan full buckets between the lift and dump stages of the dragline cycle. The bucket is segmented from the scene using cluster analysis, and the pose of the bucket is calculated using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Payload points are identified using a known model and subsequently converted into a height grid for volume estimation. Results from both scaled and full scale implementations show that this method can achieve an accuracy of above 95%.",29

The application differs from most existing robotics research in that it requires a detailed world model of the sub-surface geological structure. This in-ground geological information is then used to drive many of the planning and control decisions made on a mine site. This paper formulates a method for automatically detecting in-ground geological boundaries using geophysical logging sensors and a supervised learning algorithm. The algorithm uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) and a single length scale squared exponential covariance function. The approach is demonstrated on data from a producing iron-ore mine in Australia. Our results show that two separate distinctive geological boundaries can be automatically identified with an accuracy of over 99 percent. The alternative approach to automatic detection involves manual examination of these data.",8
icra,None,Force control of flexible catheter robots for beating heart surgery,"Samuel B. Kesner,Robert D. Howe,","Recent developments in cardiac catheter technology promise to allow physicians to perform most cardiac interventions without stopping the heart or opening the chest. However, current cardiac devices, including newly developed catheter robots, are unable to accurately track and interact with the fast moving cardiac tissue without applying potentially damaging forces. This paper examines the challenges of implementing force control on a flexible robotic catheter. In particular, catheter friction and backlash must be compensated when controlling tissue interaction forces. Force controller designs are introduced and evaluated experimentally in a number of configurations. The controllers are based on the inner position loop force control approach where the position trajectory is adjusted to achieve a desired force on the target. Friction and backlash compensation improved force tracking up to 86% with residual RMS errors of 0.11 N while following a prerecorded cardiac tissue trajectory with accelerations of up to 3800 mm/s 2 . This performance provides sufficient accuracy to enable a wide range of beating heart surgical procedures.",77
icra,None,Behavior recognition in laboratory mice using HFR video analysis,"Yuman Nie,Takeshi Takaki,Idaku Ishii,Hiroshi Matsuda,","Abstract-In this paper, we propose an automatic behavior recognition algorithm for laboratory mice to determine their typical model behaviors and hence detect the degrees of diseases via animal testings for behavioral pharmacology. The algorithm can quantify several model behaviors of mice by detecting the repetitive motions of fore or hind limbs at several hertz; these motions, too rapid for the naked eye and the NTSC cameras, are captured on a high-frame-rate video. Even when a mouse changes its position and orientation, the algorithm can always detect these repetitive motions as periodic frame differential image features on four segmented regions-head, left side, right side, and tail-because the silhouette image of a mouse is converted in the polar coordinate system as its shift and rotation-invariant shape by detecting the positions of its head and tail. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated for six typical model behaviors, including scratching and grooming, by analyzing the experimental results for several laboratory mice, obtained by capturing long-term videos at 240 fps. We have provided the detection/correction ratios and compared the time durations of the model behaviors of these mice.",8
icra,None,Compensating beating heart motion displayed by a heart motion simulator,"Martin Groeger,Renat Iskakov,Gerd Hirzinger,","The compensation of motion of the beating heart is investigated in the context of minimally invasive robotic surgery. Although reduced by mechanical stabilisers, residual tissue motion makes surgery still difficult and time consuming. Compensation for this motion is therefore highly desirable. Motion can be captured by tracking natural landmarks on the heart surface viewed by a video endoscope. The proposed motion compensation scenario uses tracked motion information on the beating heart to stabilise image motion at the surgeon's display and to move his instruments accordingly, i.e. synchronously to the surface of the beating heart. The setup uses a specially designed heart motion simulator to display real heart motion and employs a particular prediction strategy to overcome latencies, which is required to achieve synchronous motion of robot instruments and the heart surface. Results show that the proposed methods are suitable to achieve the desired compensation of heart motion.",1

In this paper, we present an approach for the autonomous acquisition of visual object representations in a cluttered environment. Guided by surprise, the robot detects novel objects in a familiar environment, selects local image features which represent their appearance and stores them in a database.

For the first time, we bring together the so-called Partitioned Particle filter, an improvement of the traditional Particle filter, and the linear-parabolic lane model which alleviates many shortcomings of traditional lane models. The former improves the traditional Particle filter by subdividing the whole state space of particles into several subspaces and estimating those subspaces in a hierarchical structure, such that the number of particles for each subspace is flexible and the robustness of the whole system is increased. Furthermore, we introduce a new statistical observation model, an important part of the Particle filter, where we use multi-kernel density to model the probability distribution of lane parameters.

icra,None,Modeling and control of rate-dependent hysteresis for a piezo-driven micropositioning stage,"Qingsong Xu,Yangmin Li,","Piezoelectric hysteresis usually relies on the frequency of the input signal. Most of the existing rate-dependent models use a lot of parameters to capture the rate-dependent hysteresis. In this paper, a simple rate-dependent hysteresis model is proposed to describe the frequency dependency effect of a micropositioning stage driven by piezoelectric actuators. This model is extended from an enhanced Coleman-Hodgdon (C-H) model. It has only 9 parameters and exhibits an accuracy better than 97%. The dependencies of the model parameters on the input rate are derived based on open-loop experimental tests. As inverse rate-dependent C-H model is established to construct a feedforward compensation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the rate-dependent model over the traditional rate-independent one. The feedforward in conjunction with a PID feedback control is constructed to further attenuate the modeling errors and creep effects. Results show that the combined control scheme suppresses the tracking error by more than 8 times compared to the stand-alone PID control. It provides a sound base of practical control of the micropositioning system for micro/nano scale manipulation.",10

Then, the character decides by itself how to execute proper actions while maintaining its balance, in a virtual environment which is different from the real world. Given a manipulation task, the desired virtual task wrench is computed thanks to a force control approach. The control system takes these task wrenches into consideration and solves a constrained quadratic problem for joint torques, which are then used to drive the virtual character. The whole control problem is solved online so that the virtual character can interact in real-time with the virtual environment as well as the operator. Examples using this control framework are presented as results from simulation.",20
icra,None,Transformation control to an inverted pendulum mode of a mobile robot with wheel-arms using partial linearization,"Hiroaki Fukushima,Satoru Shinmura,Fumitoshi Matsuno,","This paper presents a shape transformation control method of a mobile robot with wheel-arms. The proposed method aims at transformation from a four-wheeled mode for high speed mobility to an inverted pendulum mode, which has advantages of high viewing position and small turning radius. The transformation starts with lifting up the wheel-arms to raise the center of gravity of the whole body. From such initial states, the body is lifted up and controlled to the target angle by partial linearization, while returning the arms to the initial angle. Then, the wheels are slowed down by properly changing the target pitch angle of the body. Stability analysis is carried out by taking into account the transient response of the body angle to the target value, which is neglected in existing work. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments.",5
icra,None,Impact dynamics of a flying soccer ball with consideration of variable characteristic of coefficient of restitution,"Jae Yeon Choi,Byung-Ju Yi,Younghun Kwon,","This paper deals with the impact dynamics of a soccer ball. The trajectory of the ball is decided according to its initial velocity, launch angle, and some aerodynamic effect. Specially, the initial velocity is created by an instant impulse given to the ball. The external impulse exerted on a ball by a kicking robot is a function of the robot's geometry and dynamic parameters. Here, the coefficient of restitution (COR) is an important parameter to calculate the impulse applied to the ball when the collision is occurred. Usually, COR has been assumed a constant value. We derive an analytical model of COR for the pendulum model colliding with a soccer ball, and show that COR varies according to the velocity. The drag force is taken into account in the COR model. The velocity-dependent characteristic of COR is applied to simulation of a soccer ball traveling a long distance. It is shown that the velocity-dependent COR considerably affects the traveling distance of the flying ball.",4

We also assess the accuracy of these methods where possible. We conclude the paper with a prescriptive description in order to guide the user of multibody simulation.",36

However, such connectivity can be easily sabotaged by a single or multiple simultaneous agent failure(s). To handle this problem, in this paper, a hybrid connectivity restoration framework, namely HERO, is developed. By integrating a distributed connectivity restoration algorithm with a potential function based motion controller, HERO can restore the connectivity of the disconnected networks subjected to a single or multiple simultaneous agent failure(s). In the mean time, inter-agent collisions and further partitions of the underlying networks can also be effectively avoided.",21
icra,None,Semi-automated haptic device for cable installation,"Yoon Jung Jeong,Homayoon Kazerooni,Eugen Solowjow,Jakob Katz,","The development of a semi-automated haptic device for installing cables is a promising application for ship building industry, as well as in other industries which require power cable installations. The most critical tasks of this device involve quickly and reliably grasping and releasing cables. In this study, we design a device with an end-effector that uses a self-locking mechanism based on rope elements. Here, the pulling force is directly transferred to the cable using a frictional connection. The modules of this device are designed for one-person-operation, and optimize for the harsh environment of shipyards. A set of equations of motions were derived from a mathematical model of the connection between rope elements of the end effector and the cable, which show that the presented design provides the necessary no-slip condition between the end effector and the cable. A printed circuit board with an 8-bit microcontroller controls the induction motor which gives 0.6 horsepower, in combination with an AC motor driver. Thereby sensor signals are processed to ensure the desired functions by the operator's commands. This device has been shown to perform with enhanced efficiency in cable-installing tasks throughout the field test in a shipyard.",0
icra,None,Multiple-goal task realization utilizing redundant degrees of freedom of task and tool attachment optimization,"Lounell B. Gueta,Jia Cheng,Ryosuke Chiba,Tamio Arai,Tsuyoshi Ueyama,,","Minimizing the task completion time of manipulator systems is essential in order to achieve high productivity. In this paper, this problem is dealt with by utilizing the redundant degrees of freedom (DOF) of a given task and the tool attachment optimization. For example, in a vision-based inspection where a camera is held by a manipulator, the extra DOF can be brought about by allowing the camera to be translated along its approach axis or rotated about this axis when capturing images. Furthermore, the manipulator end-effector position and orientation is optimized by designing an additional linkage at the manipulator end-effector which is called a tool attachment. A 7-DOF manipulator system is used in the simulations to verify the proposed approach. Results showed that this approach can minimize the task completion time by about 17% compared to conducting only motion coordination.",8
icra,None,Smooth creeping actuator by tip growth movement aiming for search and rescue operation,"Hideyuki Tsukagoshi,Nobuyuki Arai,Ichiro Kiryu,Ato Kitagawa,","This paper proposes a novel flexible fluid actuator with a long cylindrical structure, aimed at creeping smoothly even on rugged and narrow terrain. Since only the tip goes forward by drawing out the outer skin from its inside, the actuator creeps without moving against the outer environment, just like the plant's growing process. The actuator is composed of the plural flexible flat tubes, placed around the cylindrical slippery cloth in parallel, whose tips are bent to cut off the fluid passage. Moreover, it is designed to be capable of steering the direction actively by curving its tip, while the outer shape formed before remains constant. The developed prototype named ""Grow-hose-I"" creeps at the maximized speed of 500mm/s with generating the driving force of 40N in linear motion. Finally, its feasibility for search and rescue operation is discussed, aiming to make it carry small cameras and microphones as smoothly as possible at the disastrous site.",15
icra,None,"Development of the airway management training system WKA-4: For improved high-fidelity reproduction of real patient conditions, and improved tongue and mandible mechanisms","Yohan Noh,Kazuki Ebihara,Masanao Segawa,Kei Sato,Chunbao Wang,,,,,,","In recent years advanced robotic technology has seen more use in the medical field to assist in the development of efficient training systems. Such training systems must fulfill the following criteria: they must provide quantitative information, must simulate the real-world conditions of the task, and assure training effectiveness. We developed Waseda Kyotokagaku Airway series to fulfill all of those requirements. The WKA series we had developed does not consider external appearance such as patient skin, or internal appearance such as the pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Moreover, the tongue mechanism of the previous system can not precisely measure the force applied by medical devices and cannot simulate muscle stiffness. In addition, the mandible mechanism of the previous system could not adequately reproduce various airway difficulties or apply force control. For these reasons, we propose the WKA-4, which has high-fidelity simulated human anatomy, and we have improved the mechanism over the previous system. We have also attached a lung to the proposed system to improve simulation of the real-world conditions of the task. In this paper, we present how to design several organs with various embedded sensors and actuators, for a conventional patient model with high-fidelity simulated human anatomy. We also present the control system for the WKA-4. Finally, we present a set of experiments carried out using doctors as subjects, and they gave their valuable opinions about our system.",9
icra,None,Visual SLAM for autonomous ground vehicles,"Henning Lategahn,Andreas Geiger,Bernd Kitt,","Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) in particular have been an active area of research lately. In V-SLAM the main focus is most often laid on the localization part of the problem allowing for a drift free motion estimate. To this end, a sparse set of landmarks is tracked and their position is estimated. However, this set of landmarks (rendering the map) is often too sparse for tasks in autonomous driving such as navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance etc. Some methods keep the raw measurements for past robot poses to address the sparsity problem often resulting in a pose only SLAM akin to laser scanner SLAM. For the stereo case, this is however impractical due to the high noise of stereo reconstructed point clouds. In this paper we propose a dense stereo V-SLAM algorithm that estimates a dense 3D map representation which is more accurate than raw stereo measurements. Thereto, we run a sparse V SLAM system, take the resulting pose estimates to compute a locally dense representation from dense stereo correspondences. This dense representation is expressed in local coordinate systems which are tracked as part of the SLAM estimate. This allows the dense part to be continuously updated. Our system is driven by visual odometry priors to achieve high robustness when tracking landmarks. Moreover, the sparse part of the SLAM system uses recently published sub mapping techniques to achieve constant runtime complexity most of the time. The improved accuracy over raw stereo measurements is shown in a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by presenting outdoor experiments of a car like robot.",159

Our approach can be applied to more realistic scenarios than are typically studied in most previous work, including agents moving in 3D environments such as terrains, multi-story buildings, and dynamic environments. We also support more realistic three-dimensional visibility computations that allow evading agents to hide in crowds or behind hills. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on mobile robots and in simulation for a variety of scenarios including pursuit-evasion and tag on terrains, in multi-level buildings, and in crowds.",16

With the help of the aircraft sensors, the carrier is first detected in the image using a warped patch of a reference image. This provides an initialization to a real time 3D model-based tracker estimating the camera pose during the sequence. This method is demonstrated and evaluated using a simulator with high-fidelity visualization and on real video.",39
icra,None,Composite control based on optimal torque control and adaptive Kriging control for the CRAB rover,"Bin Xu,Cedric Pradalier,Ambroise Krebs,Roland Siegwart,Fuchun Sun,","Terrainability is mostly dependant on the suspension mechanism and the control of a space rover. For the six wheeled CRAB rover, this paper presents the composite control design with torque control and adaptive Kriging control to improve the terrainability, somewhat related to minimizing wheel slip. As CRAB is moving slowly, the torque control is processed by minimizing the variance of the required friction coefficient based on the static model. Adaptive Kriging control is used to track the commanded velocity. The system uncertainty is compensated by Kriging estimation based on the velocity dynamics. Experiment results with two different tires show the effectiveness of the control scheme.",18
icra,None,A dense structure model for image based stereo SLAM,"Tommi Tykkälä,Andrew I. Comport,",In this paper a dense structure model is developed for stereo image based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). It is proposed to model dense environment structure incrementally by robustly integrating disparity maps from current and previous time instants. In this way disparities can be refined over time to favor consistent 3D structure over noise. The analytical search bounds for disparities are transferred into the current map to allow efficient re-localization. The cost function is image-based and it is minimized by combining Iteratively Reweighted Least-Squares (IRLS) with exhaustive search for finding motion and disparity parameters respectively.,21
icra,None,A first-order solution to simultaneous localization and mapping with graphical models,"Luca Carlone,Rosario Aragues,José A. Castellanos,Basilio Bona,","In this work we investigate the problem of Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) for the case in which the information acquired by the robot is modeled as a network of constraints in a graphical model. Analyzing the resulting formulation we propose a closed-form approach to tackle the problem, which is proved to retrieve a first-order approximation of the actual nonlinear solution, under mild assumptions on the structure of the involved covariance matrices. The outcome of the analysis reveals several desirable properties of the proposed approach: no initial guess for optimization is needed and the technique is able to correctly estimate robot posterior also in presence of arbitrarily long loops. The approach is further validated by means of extensive simulations and real tests, and the consistency of the estimation process is also evaluated. We remark that this work is not intended to extend the already crowded literature on SLAM but is aimed at providing a consistent analytical insight, useful for efficiently attacking several open research issues, like active SLAM and exploration, for which the computational cost of simulating SLAM posterior still constitutes a troublesome bottleneck.",14
icra,None,MDL-based control method for mobile robot with randomly varying time-delay,"Jianning Hua,Hongyi Li,Yuechao Wang,Ning Xi,","Robotic teleoperation constitutes a key technique for networked manufacturing system. Since Internet is noisy and performance of telerobotic systems strongly depends on communication conditions, control strategies which could be used to distribute computation and communication resource properly and require less data transmission are required. Motion description language (MDL) is an appropriate solution. In this paper, comparison study between MDL-based and the traditional direct control method under randomly varying time-delay condition has been pursued which show that the MDL-based method has the ability to guarantee the stability of the whole telerobotic system under randomly varying time-delay condition. Furthermore, MDL-based method provides an uniform mathematical description on discrete control on the master site and continuous execution on the slave site. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is promising for Networked Manufacturing development.",4

The strain gages are embedded in silicone under different configurations like corpuscle in humans skin. Both static displacement and dynamic excitations are applied in arbitrary positions, with different magnitudes and frequencies. The responses are observed by measuring the output signals from strain gages. Comparison with FEM simulation of static displacement shows intuitive agreement. The responses to dynamic excitation in typical frequency range of human somatosensors are obtained both experimentally and with simulation of dynamic modeling. We found that each configuration has advantages and disadvantages. This paper shows how strain gages embedded in silicone will behave in response to both static and dynamic excitations, and suggests modeling and fundamental concepts to design a bio-inspired artificial skin sensor.",2
icra,None,3D piecewise planar object model for robotics manipulation,"Johann Prankl,Michael Zillich,Markus Vincze,","Man-made environments are abundant with planar surfaces which have attractive properties for robotics manipulation tasks and are a prerequisite for a variety of vision tasks. This work presents automatic on-line 3D object model acquisition assuming a robot to manipulate the object. Objects are represented with piecewise planar surfaces in a spatio-temporal graph. Planes once detected as homographies are tracked and serve as priors in subsequent images. After reconstruction of the planes the 3D motion is analyzed and initial object hypotheses are created. In case planes start moving independently a split event is triggered, the spatio-temporal object graph is traced back and visible planes as well as occluded planes are assigned to the most probable split object. The novelty of this framework is to formalize Multi-body Structure-and-Motion (MSaM), that is, to segment interest point tracks into different rigid objects and compute the multiple-view geometry of each object, with Minimal Description Length (MDL) based on model selection of planes in an incremental manner. Thus, object models are built from planes, which directly can be used for robotic manipulation.",8
icra,None,Swimming speed control and on-board flow sensing of an artificial trout,"Maarja Kruusmaa,Gert Toming,Taavi Salumäe,Jaas Ježov,Andres Ernits,","This paper describes a sensing-actuation coupling of a robotic trout that detects changes of the laminar flow speed using an on-board pressure sensor and adjusts its tail-beat frequency for steady swimming. The caudal fin actuator closely mimics the morphology of a real trout, in particular the geometry, stiffness and stiffness distribution of the body and the caudal fin. We hypothesize that the linear relationship between the tail-beat frequency and speed, well-known and proven to hold for all fish studied so far, also holds for an artificial fish. We validate the hypothesis and use the results to derive a linear control law to adjust the tail-beat frequency to the swimming speed. We use an onboard pressure sensor to detect the flow speed and test the actuation in a controlled hydrodynamic environment in a flow pipe.",16
icra,None,Open-loop control experiments on driver assistance for crane forestry machines,"Daniel Ortíz Morales,Simon Westerberg,Pedro La Hera,Uwe Mettin,,,","A short term goal in the forest industry is semi-automation of existing machines for the tasks of logging and harvesting. One way to assist drivers is to provide a set of predefined trajectories that can be used repeatedly in the process. In recent years much effort has been directed to the design of control strategies and task planning as part of this solution. However, commercialization of such automatic schemes requires the installation of various sensing devices, computers and most of all a redesign of the machine itself, which is currently undesired by manufacturers. Here we present an approach of implementing predefined trajectories in an open-loop fashion, which avoids the complexity of sensor and computer integration. The experimental results are carried out on a commercial hydraulic crane to demonstrate that this solution is feasible in practice.",14
icra,None,A LIDAR streaming architecture for mobile robotics with application to 3D structure characterization,"Mayank Bansal,Bogdan Matei,Ben Southall,Jayan Eledath,Harpreet Sawhney,","We present a novel LIDAR streaming architecture for real-time, on-board processing using unmanned robots. We propose a two-level 3D data structure that allows pipelined and streaming processing of the 3D data as it arrives from a moving robot: (i) at the coarse level, the incoming 3D scans are stored in memory in a dense 3D voxel grid with a relatively large voxel size - this ensures buffering of the most recent data and the availability of sufficient 3D measurements within a specific processing volume at the next level; (ii) at the fine level, we employ a data chunking mechanism guided by the movement of the robot and a rolling dense 3D voxel grid for processing the data in the immediate vicinity of the robot, which enables reuse of previously computed features. The architecture proposed requires a very small memory footprint, minimal data copying, and allows a fast spatial access for 3D data, even at the finest resolutions. We illustrate the proposed streaming architecture on a real-time 3D structure characterization task for detecting doors and stairs in indoor environments and show qualitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",19
icra,None,Feature based SLAM using laser sensor data with maximized information usage,"Minjie Liu,Shoudong Huang,Gamini Dissanayake,","This paper formulates the SLAM problem using 2D laser data as an optimization problem. The environment is modeled as a set of curves and the variables of the optimization problem are the robot poses as well as the parameters describing the curves. There are two key differences between this SLAM formulation and existing SLAM methods. First, the environment is represented by continuous curves instead of point clouds or occupancy grids. Second, all the laser readings, including laser beams which returns its maximum range value, have been included in the objective function. As the objective function to be optimized contains discontinuities, it can not be solved by standard gradient based approaches and thus a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based method is applied. Matching of laser scans acquired from relatively far apart robot poses is achieved by applying GA on top of the Iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The new SLAM formulation and the use of a global optimization algorithm successfully avoid the convergence to local minimum for both the scan matching and the SLAM problem. Both simulated and experimental data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",28

With its advanced sensing capabilities and the potential for mass adoption, this technology represents an opportunity to dramatically increase robotic object recognition, manipulation, navigation, and interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical multi-view object dataset collected using an RGB-D camera. The dataset contains 300 objects organized into 51 categories and has been made publicly available to the research community so as to enable rapid progress based on this promising technology.

Computer Generated Hologram (CGH) is one of the techniques and it can trap more than 200 objects in three dimension. For dexterous micromanipulation, it is useful to apply robotics into optical tweezers. In this research, we designed the optical system and control system of Holographic Optical Tweezers (HOT). For optical design, we considered working space and positioning resolution. For control design, we applied teleoperation. For online generation of hologram, we developed GCH generator applied General-purpose GPU (GPGPU) acceleration. This system achieved high-speed generation of hologram (250 Hz).

icra,None,Meso-scale compliant gripper inspired by caterpillar's proleg,"Gwang-Pil Jung,Je-Sung Koh,Kyu-Jin Cho,","We propose a biomimetic gripper, inspired by a caterpillar's proleg, that can reliably grip dusty and rough terrain. A caterpillar's proleg makes this possible by using a retractor muscle that opens and closes the proleg, and a planta that gives compliance to the proleg. We implement these components with shape memory alloy (SMA) coil actuators and flexure joints. The gripper is fabricated using composite links and flexure joints. This method replaces metal-based joints and links with flexure joints and composite-based rigid links. The composite-based design provides a simple, light weight, and compact structure that enables the gripper to be applied to small-scale robots. Modeling and experiments are used to analyze the gripping force. The results show how the gripping force changes depending on the length of the flexure joint. A prototype was built to demonstrate reliable gripping on a rough-surfaced block using an adaptive mechanism.",12
icra,None,1000-fps target tracking using vibration-based image features,"Idaku Ishii,Ikuya Ohara,Tetsuro Tatebe,Takeshi Takaki,","In this paper, we propose a concept for the real time target tracking of vibrating objects to extract vibration image regions using digital filters at all the pixels in an image, assuming that periodic changes in image intensities exist at pixels around vibrating objects. By combining vibration-based processing with color extraction as a masking process, our algorithm can prevent the latency effect on a digital filter, which may degrade its tracking performance. Digital filters at a pixel level are implemented on a 1000-fps vision system that can measure vibration distribution over a wide range of frequencies. On our target tracking system, we can track a vibrating object at the center of the camera view by controlling a 2-DOF (Degree Of Freedom) active vision system with vibration-based image features. We have verified its effectiveness by presenting several experimental results using objects vibrating at high frequencies, which cannot be observed with the naked eye.",8
icra,None,Finding the adequate resolution for grid mapping - Cell sizes locally adapting on-the-fly,"Erik Einhorn,Christof Schröter,Horst-Michael Gross,","For robot mapping occupancy grid maps are the most common representation of the environment. However, most existing algorithms for creating such maps assume a fixed resolution of the grid cells. In this paper we present a novel mapping technique that chooses the resolution of each cell adaptively by merging and splitting cells depending on the measurements. The splitting of the cells is based on a statistical measure that we derive in this paper. In contrast to other approaches the adaption of the resolution is done online during the mapping process itself. Additionally, we introduce the Nd-Tree, a generalization of quadtrees and octrees that allows to subdivide any d-dimensional volume recursively with N d children per node. Using this data structure our approach can be implemented in a very generic way and allows the creation of 2D, 3D and even higher dimensional maps using the same algorithm.

icra,None,Predicting the unobservable Visual 3D tracking with a probabilistic motion model,"Thomas Mörwald,Marek Kopicki,Rustam Stolkin,Jeremy Wyatt,,,,","Visual tracking of an object can provide a powerful source of feedback information during complex robotic manipulation operations, especially those in which there may be uncertainty about which new object pose may result from a planned manipulative action. At the same time, robotic manipulation can provide a challenging environment for visual tracking, with occlusions of the object by other objects or by the robot itself, and sudden changes in object pose that may be accompanied by motion blur. Recursive filtering techniques use motion models for predictor-corrector tracking, but the simple models typically used often fail to adequately predict the complex motions of manipulated objects. We show how statistical machine learning techniques can be used to train sophisticated motion predictors, which incorporate additional information by being conditioned on the planned manipulative action being executed. We then show how these learned predictors can be used to propagate the particles of a particle filter from one predictor-corrector step to the next, enabling a visual tracking algorithm to maintain plausible hypotheses about the location of an object, even during severe occlusion and other difficult conditions. We demonstrate the approach in the context of robotic push manipulation, where a 5-axis robot arm equipped with a rigid finger applies a series of pushes to an object, while it is tracked by a vision algorithm using a single camera.",14

In addition, we use a mid-level planner to optimize individual actions according to the plan. The proposed framework incorporates biologically-inspired concepts, such as affordances and motor primitives, in order to efficiently plan for manipulation tasks. The final framework is modular, can generalize well to different situations, and is straightforward to expand. Our demonstrations also show how the use of affordances and mid-level planning can lead to improved performance.",11
icra,None,Classification of clothing using interactive perception,"Bryan Willimon,Stan Birchfield,Ian Walker,","We present a system for automatically extracting and classifying items in a pile of laundry. Using only visual sensors, the robot identifies and extracts items sequentially from the pile. When an item has been removed and isolated, a model is captured of the shape and appearance of the object, which is then compared against a database of known items. The classification procedure relies upon silhouettes, edges, and other low-level image measurements of the articles of clothing. The contributions of this paper are a novel method for extracting articles of clothing from a pile of laundry and a novel method of classifying clothing using interactive perception. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the system to efficiently classify and label into one of six categories (pants, shorts, short-sleeve shirt, long-sleeve shirt, socks, or underwear). These results show that, on average, classification rates using robot interaction are 59% higher than those that do not use interaction.",92

We describe a general purpose feature detector that is not only efficient, but also applicable to virtually any environment. Our method shares its mathematical foundation with feature detectors from the computer vision community, where structure tensor based methods have been successful. Our resulting method is capable of identifying stable and repeatable features at a variety of spatial scales, and produces uncertainty estimates for use in a state estimation algorithm. We verify the proposed method on standard datasets, including the Victoria Park dataset and the Intel Research Center dataset.",53

This paper demonstrates the use of dependent Gaussian processes for data fusion in the context of large scale terrain modeling. Specifically, this paper derives and demonstrates the use of a non-stationary kernel (Neural Network) in this context. Experiments performed on multiple large scale (spanning about 5 sq km) 3D terrain data sets obtained from multiple sensory modalities (GPS surveys and laser scans) demonstrate the approach to data fusion and provide a preliminary demonstration of the superior modeling capability of Gaussian processes based on this kernel.",27
icra,None,Assisted driving of a mobile remote presence system: System design and controlled user evaluation,"Leila Takayama,Eitan Marder-Eppstein,Helen Harris,Jenay M. Beer,","As mobile remote presence (MRP) systems become more pervasive in everyday environments such as office spaces, it is important for operators to navigate through remote locations without running into obstacles. Human-populated environments frequently change (e.g., doors open and close, furniture is moved around) and mobile remote presence systems must be able to adapt to such changes and to avoid running into obstacles. As such, we implemented an assisted teleoperation feature for a MRP system and evaluated its effectiveness with a controlled user study, focusing on both the system-oriented dimensions (e.g., autonomous assistance vs. no assistance) and human-oriented dimensions (e.g., gaming experience, locus of control, and spatial cognitive abilities) (N=24). In a systems-only analysis, we found that the assisted teleoperation helped people avoid obstacles. However, assisted teleoperation also increased time to complete an obstacle course. When human-oriented dimensions were evaluated, gaming experience and locus of control affected speed of completing the course. Implications for future research and design are discussed.",83

icra,None,A distributed model for needle-tissue friction in percutaneous interventions,"Ali Asadian,Rajni V. Patel,Mehrdad R. Kermani,","This paper presents a new approach to account for distributed friction in needle insertion in soft tissue. As is well known, friction is a complex nonlinear phenomenon, and it appears that classical or static models are unable to capture some of the observations in systems subject to significant frictional effects. To characterize dynamic features when the needle is very flexible and friction plays an important role in bending mechanics or when a stop-and-start planning scenario is implemented at low insertion velocities, a distributed LuGre model can be adopted. Experimental results using an artificial phantom illustrate that the proposed method is capable of representing the main features of friction which is a major force component in needle-tissue interaction during percutaneous interventions.",38
icra,None,Scene classification with a sparse set of salient regions,"Ali Borji,Laurent Itti,","This work proposes an approach for scene classification by extracting and matching visual features only at the focuses of visual attention instead of the entire scene. Analysis over a database of natural scenes demonstrates that regions proposed by the saliency-based model of visual attention are robust to image transformations. Using a nearest neighbor classifier and a distance measure defined over the salient regions, we obtained 97.35% and 78.28% classification rates with SIFT and C2 features from the HMAX model at 5 salient regions covering at most 31% of the image. Classification with features extracted from the entire image results in 99.3% and 82.32% using SIFT and C2 features, respectively. Comparing attentional and adhoc approaches shows that classification rate of the first approach is 0.95 of the second. Overall, our results prove that efficient scene classification, in terms of reducing the complexity of feature extraction is possible without a significant drop in performance.",47
icra,None,An adaptive data driven model for characterizing rock properties from Drilling data,"Hang Zhou,Peter Hatherly,Fabio Ramos,Eric Nettleton,","Autonomous operation of blast hole drill rigs requires monitoring of drilling parameters known as ""Measurement While Drilling"" (MWD) data. From these data, rock properties can be inferred. A supervised classification scheme is usually used to map MWD data inputs to rock type outputs given some labeled training data. However, the geology has no definite ground truth that can allow a reliable labeling of the training data, nor is there a clear input-output pair connection between the MWD data and the rock types. In this paper, an adaptive unsupervised approach is proposed to estimate the rock types in a data driven way by minimizing the entropy gradient of the characterizing measure ""Optimized Adjusted Penetration Rate"" (OAPR). Neither data labeling nor fixed model parameters are required because of the data driven nature of the algorithm. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our solution.",22
icra,None,Adaptive-gain complementary filter of inertial and magnetic data for orientation estimation,"James Calusdian,Xiaoping Yun,Eric Bachmann,","Accurate estimation of orientation based on data from small low-cost strapdown inertial and magnetic sensors is often inaccurate during highly dynamic motion or when trying to track movements that include two or more periods characterized by significantly different frequencies. This paper presents a complementary filtering algorithm for estimating orientation based on inertial/magnetic sensor measurements. The algorithm takes advantage of the complementary nature of the information offered by high-frequency angular rate sensor data and low frequency accelerometers and magnetometers. The filtering algorithm utilizes a single gain that can be adaptively adjusted to achieve satisfactory performance while tracking two or more different types of motion. An additional feature of our approach involves the simple estimation of the gyro bias during periods exhibiting low dynamics and its subsequent use to correct the instantaneous gyro measurements. Simulation and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the performance of the algorithm during slow or nearly static movements, as well as, those which are highly dynamic. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm is able to track pitch and roll during dynamic motion with an RMS error of less than two degrees. This is believed to be superior to current proprietary commercial algorithms.",65
icra,None,Experimental validation of the influence of kinematic redundancy on the pose accuracy of parallel kinematic machines,"Jens Kotlarski,Bodo Heimann,Tobias Ortmaier,","In this paper experimental results are presented to compare the performance of kinematically redundant parallel robots with respect to their non-redundant counterparts. The main purpose is to validate existing simulated, i.e. claimed, findings demonstrating the advantages of kinematic redundancy in terms of singularity avoidance and, therefore, accuracy and precision. Exemplarily, the kinematically redundant prototype of the Institute at Mechatronic Systems is introduced. It is based on the well known planar 3RRR mechanism. In order to achieve kinematic redundancy, a prismatic actuator is added to the structure allowing one base joint to move linearly. As a result, the mechanism is able to reconfigure, i.e. optimize, its geometry according to different performance criteria and motion strategies. While performing a geometrical reconfiguration and following several desired (optimized) trajectories the pose of the end-effector is determined using an external measurement device. Hence, in addition to the encoder data of the actuators the performance can be analyzed without using any (uncertain) kinematic models. This allows for a meaningful comparative evaluation of the performance of kinematically redundant mechanisms.",33
icra,None,Towards appearance-based methods for lidar sensors,"Colin McManus,Paul Furgale,Timothy D. Barfoot,","Cameras have emerged as the dominant sensor modality for localization and mapping in three-dimensional, unstructured terrain, largely due to the success of sparse, appearance-based techniques, such as visual odometry. However, the Achilles' heel for all camera-based systems is their dependence on consistent ambient lighting, which poses a serious problem in outdoor environments that lack adequate or consistent light, such as the Moon. Actively illuminated sensors on the other hand, such as a light detection and ranging (lidar) device, use their own light source to illuminate the scene, making them a favourable alternative in light-denied environments. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the largely successful appearance-based methods traditionally used with cameras can be applied to laser-based sensors, such as a lidar. We present two experiments that are vital to understanding and enabling appearance-based methods for lidar sensors. In the first experiment, we explore the stability of a representative keypoint detection and description algorithm on both camera images and lidar intensity images collected over a 24 hour period. In the second experiment, we validate our approach by implementing visual odometry based on sparse bundle adjustment on a sequence of lidar intensity images.",43
icra,None,Towards semi-supervised learning of semantic spatial concepts,"Jesus Martinez-Gomez,Barbara Caputo,","The ability of building robust semantic space representations of environments is crucial for the development of truly autonomous robots. This task, inherently connected with cognition, is traditionally achieved by training the robot with a supervised learning phase. We argue that the design of robust and autonomous systems would greatly benefit from adopting a semi-supervised online learning approach. Indeed, the support of open-ended, lifelong learning is fundamental in order to cope with the dazzling variability of the real world, and online learning provides precisely this kind of ability. Here we focus on the robot place recognition problem, and we present an online place classification algorithm that is able to detect gap in its own knowledge based on a confidence measure. For every incoming new image frame, the method is able to decide if (a) it is a known room with a familiar appearance, (b) it is a known room with a challenging appearance, or (c) it is a new, unknown room. Experiments on a subset of the challenging COLD database show the promise of our approach.",10
icra,None,Individual hand model to reconstruct behavior from motion capture data,"Natsuki Miyata,Yuichi Motoki,Yuki Shimizu,Yusuke Maeda,","This paper proposes a method to build an individual hand model that consists of a surface skin and an inside link model, which can be used to reconstruct hand behavior from motion capture (MoCap) data. Our system uses a static posture data, a palmar side photo and marker positions captured simultaneously by MoCap, to reduce extra time and effort demanded for each subject to build a model. From this modeling scan, several hand dimensions and marker positions are obtained. Joint centers are estimated based on regression analysis about joint centers, marker positions and some hand dimensions derived from magnetic resonance (MR) images of eight subjects. The skin surface is built by scaling a generic hand model so that it satisfies the measured dimensions. The proposed system will be validated through an experiment to build four subjects' hand models.",11
icra,None,Towards quantitative modeling of task confirmations in human-robot dialog,"Junaed Sattar,Gregory Dudek,","We present a technique for robust human-robot interaction taking into consideration uncertainty in input and task execution costs incurred by the robot. Specifically, this research aims to quantitatively model confirmation feedback, as required by a robot while communicating with a human operator to perform a particular task. Our goal is to model human-robot interaction from the perspective of risk minimization, taking into account errors in communication, ""risk"" involved in performing the required task, and task execution costs. Given an input modality with non-trivial uncertainty, we calculate the cost associated with performing the task specified by the user, and if deemed necessary, ask the user for confirmation. The estimated task cost and the uncertainty measure are given as input to a Decision Function, the output of which is then used to decide whether to execute the task, or request clarification from the user. We test our system through human-interface experiments, based on a framework custom-designed for our family of amphibious robots, and demonstrate the utility of the framework in the presence of large task costs and uncertainties. We also present qualitative results of our algorithm from field trials of our robots in both open-and closed-water environments.",15
icra,None,Heterogeneous modules with a homogeneous electromechanical interface in multi-module systems for space exploration,"Alexander Dettmann,Zhuowei Wang,Wiebke Wenzel,Florian Cordes,,","The work presented in this paper is part of the RIMRES 1 project. We describe the design and development of an electromechanical interface for combining heterogeneous modules. The interface has a male and a female face and allows docking in 90-degree steps. The developed concept guarantees a secure connecting and disconnecting in rough environments with fine dust as existing on celestial bodies such as Mars and Moon. A short introduction into the project RIMRES is given with focus on the modularity of the system. After providing the design considerations for the interface, experimental results with the hardware are presented. The experiments show that the interface is capable of operating mechanically with heavy loads of up to 40 kg. The proposed latch mechanism tolerates layers of dust of up to 2 mm. Thus, an electrical as well as mechanical connection in dusty environments is realized.",11
icra,None,Prediction of human behaviors in the future through symbolic inference,"Wataru Takano,Hirotaka Imagawa,Yoshihiko Nakamura,","This paper proposes an approach to construct a system which allows humanoid robots to recognize human behaviors and predict his or her future behaviors. The system consists of two modules : ""motion symbol tree"" and ""motion symbol graph"", Human demonstrator motion patterns are stored as motion symbols, which abstract the motion data by using Hidden Markov Models. The stored motion patterns are organized into a hierarchical tree structure, which represents the similarity among the motion patterns and provides abstracted motion patterns. The formed hierarchical structure is the motion symbol tree. Concatenated sequences of motion patterns are stochastically represented as transitions between the motion patterns by using an Ngram Model, and the causality among the human behaviors are extracted. This structure is the motion symbol graph. The behavioral hierarchy and transition model make it possible to predict human behaviors during observation and to generate sequences of motion patterns automatically while maintaining a natural motion stream, as if the system is a ""crystal ball"" to reflect future behaviors. The experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework on a large scale motion data.",18
icra,None,Motion learning in variable environments using probabilistic flow tubes,"Shuonan Dong,Brian Williams,","Commanding an autonomous system through complex motions at a low level can be tedious or impractical for systems with many degrees of freedom. Allowing an operator to demonstrate the desired motions directly can often enable more intuitive and efficient interaction. Two challenges in the field of learning from demonstration include (1) how to best represent learned motions to accurately reflect a human's intentions, and (2) how to enable learned motions to be easily applicable in new situations. This paper introduces a novel representation of continuous actions called probabilistic flow tubes that can provide flexibility during execution while robustly encoding a human's intended motions. Our approach also automatically determines certain qualitative characteristics of a motion so that these characteristics can be preserved when autonomously executing the motion in a new situation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our motion learning approach both in a simulated two-dimensional environment and on the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) robot performing object manipulation tasks.",29
icra,None,Toward Ultra High Speed Locomotors: Design and test of a cheetah robot hind limb,"M. Anthony Lewis,Matthew R.

The cheetah is an existence proof of what the authors term an Ultra-High Speed Locomotor, which can attain speeds of greater than 50 leg lengths per second and can cover 10 meters in a single gait cycle. In this paper, the energetics and dynamics of high-speed quadruped movement are analyzed. A leg design is presented that combines a novel hybrid actuator concept plus biarticular muscles to create a lightweight (17 Newton) leg capable of generating 90 Newtons of force. Static and dynamic test results show the promise of the hybrid actuator system in ultra high-speed locomotors.",57
icra,None,A neuromuscular locomotion controller that realizes human-like responses to unexpected disturbances,"Akihiko Murai,Katsu Yamane,","In this paper, we demonstrate that a neuromuscular controller built based on the human anatomical structure and motion data can realize human-like responses to unexpected disturbances during locomotion. This particular work concerns the response to trips due to obstacles and shows that the two strategies identified in biomechanics emerge from a single controller. We first identify the parameters of a neuromuscular network model using the muscle tension data during a human walking motion. The anatomically-correct network models the somatosensory reflex of the human neuromuscular system. We use this network as the controller for a musculoskeletal human model to simulate its response to disturbances. Simulation results show that our neuromuscular controller automatically results in the appropriate trip recovery strategy with a single set of parameters, although we do not explicitly model the trip response or the condition to invoke each strategy. This result implies that an appropriately designed locomotion controller can also provide rapid responses to trips without deliberate controller selection or planning.",20

The mechanism consists of a four-bar linkage that realizes a mechanical singularity for locking the knee when the leg is in the extended position. Once extended, the knee remains locked without energy consumption, while unlocking it only costs a small amount of energy. Tests showed that the robot walks robustly and that the energy consumption of the new system is low.",30
icra,None,Effect of rolling on running performance,"Jae Yun Jun,Jonathan E. Clark,","The present work investigates the effect of rolling contact during stance phase in running by relating the variation of foot curvature radii to running efficiency, stability and forward speed. Both a conservative reduced-order running model and one with a simple motor and friction model are used to simulate running with a rolling foot. We find that having a larger foot radius implies smoother peak vertical ground reaction forces. Increased foot radius also yields, up to a point, a larger region of stable gaits for the conservative system, and more stable, fast, and efficient gaits for the actuated version. These results motivate the design of a new set of legs to test these findings on a dynamic running platform.",28
icra,None,The analysis on period doubling gait and chaotic gait of the compass-gait biped model,"Jie Zhao,Xiaoguang Wu,Xizhe Zang,Yanhe Zhu,Lei Zhu,","The passive dynamic walking model, which can only depend on the gravity and its own inertia, presents stable, high-efficient, natural periodic gait on a slight slope. The stable periodic gait of the robot has a delicate balance of energy conversion, which makes the gait adjust itself as the parameters of the model change. In our work, the cell mapping method is combined with Newton-Raphson iteration to obtain the limit cycle of the periodic gait in the model, the track stability of the limit cycle is analyzed, and the eigenvalues change rule of Poincare Jacobi matrix is deduced. The influence of changing parameters on the gait is analyzed and discussed by simulations on the model with different sets of parameters. The result suggests that, the location of the center of leg mass too high or too low, foot radius increase or decrease, the slope or moment of inertia increase, will lead to the occurrence of bifurcation of the gait period and chaos; while the way the gait enters chaos from period doubling bifurcation, which results from different parameters change, obeys the law all the period doubling bifurcation share, that is, it has the same Feigenbaum constant. Furthermore, the dynamic features of the robot at the entrance of the chaos are obtained by the rule of the period doubling bifurcation of the gait; meanwhile, it can be found by the analysis of the gait features in the chaos area that there is also certain periodic law in the chaotic gait.",5
icra,None,Online design of torso height trajectories for walking patterns that takes future kinematic limits into consideration,"Koichi Nishiwaki,Satoshi Kagami,",This paper presents an online generation method of a torso height trajectory as a part of walking pattern generation. Torso height trajectories should be designed carefully in order to meet the constraints that are given by the existence of the inverse kinematics solution and limitations of the leg joint angle velocity. Limitations of the height in the future are evaluated and taken into consideration for deciding the height of the torso at a moment. In this manner a trajectory that satisfies the limitations and given maximum acceleration and velocity is generated. The proposed method is implemented as a part of online walking control system of full-size Humanoid HRP-2. Its performance is confirmed through the pattern generation in the walking control system.,14
icra,None,The design of the lower body of the compliant humanoid robot “cCub”,"Nikos G. Tsagarakis,Zhibin Li,Jody Saglia,Darwin G. Caldwell,","The “iCub ”is a robotic platform that was developed by the RobotCub [1] consortium to provide the cognition research community with an open “child-like ”humanoid platform for understanding and development of cognitive systems [1]. In this paper we present the mechanical realization of the lower body developed for the “cCub ”humanoid robot, a derivative of the original “iCub”, which has passive compliance in the major joints of the legs. It is hypothesized that this will give to the robot high versatility to cope with unpredictable disturbance ranging from small uneven terrain variations to unexpected collisions or even accidental falls. As part of the AMARSI European project, the passive compliance of this newly developed robot will be exploited for safer interaction, energy efficient and more aggressive damage-safe learning. The passive compliant actuation module used is a compact unit based on the series elastic actuator principle (SEA). In addition to the passive compliance the “cCub ”design includes other significant updates over the original prototype such as full joint state sensing including joint torque sensing and improved range of motion and torque capabilities. In this paper, the new leg mechanisms of the “cCub ”robot are introduced.",137

The humanoid robot, WABIAN-2R, has achieved human-like walking with heel contact and toe off motions by using a human-like foot mechanism with a passive toe joint. The human-like foot enables a robot to turn by using slipping motion between the feet and the ground because it can switch ground contact conditions such as heel contact, sole contact and toe contact. To realize a slipping turn, we develop an attitude control. Verification of the proposed method is conducted through experiments with a biped humanoid robot WABIAN-2R. WABIAN-2R realized a quick turn by using slipping motion with both feet. We also confirmed that the energy consumption of a slipping turn is less than that of a stepping turn.",36

In this work, we present a practical hierarchical push recovery strategy that can be readily implemented on a wide range of humanoid robots. Our method consists of low level controllers that perform simple, biomechanically motivated push recovery actions and a high level controller that combines the low level controllers according to proprioceptive and inertial sensory signals and the current robot state. Reinforcement learning is used to optimize the parameters of the controllers in order to maximize the stability of the robot over a broad range of external disturbances. The controllers are learned on a physical simulation and implemented on the Darwin-HP humanoid robot platform, and the resulting experiments demonstrate effective full body push recovery behaviors during dynamic walking.",41
icra,None,Postural control in a bipedal robot using sensory reweighting,"Theresa J. Klein,M. Anthony Lewis,John Jeka,Tim Kiemel,","Postural control is a difficult problem for bipedal robots. Even in robots restricted to the sagittal plane, the system must react to falling forward or backward to stabilize itself during walking, standing, and during initiation and termination of walking. Most robots rely mainly on proprioceptive information such as foot pressure sensors and joint angle sensors for balance. By contrast, humans use a variety of sensory sources, including visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sources to adapt fluidly to varying conditions. These sensory inputs combine to control posture but are ""reweighted"" in response to changing conditions such as floor motion, visual scene motion, and degradation in vestibular sensitivity. Based on models of sensory reweighting in humans, we implement a sensory reweighting scheme in a bipedal robot using an adaptive Kalman filter. The adaptive filter uses an online estimate of the noise variance to adjust the Kalman gain depending on time-varying noise conditions. Thus, the robot automatically downweight sensory channels with unreliable data.",1

Automatic vehicle detection by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) will replace current pipeline patrol services that rely on pilot visual inspection of the pipeline from low altitude high risk flights that are often restricted by weather conditions. Our research compares a set of feature extraction methods applied for this specific task and four classification techniques.

icra,None,Recognition of 6 DOF rigid body motion trajectories using a coordinate-free representation,"Joris De Schutter,Enrico Di Lello,Jochem F.M. De Schutter,Roel Matthysen,,,","This paper presents an approach to recognize 6 DOF rigid body motion trajectories (3D translation + rotation), such as the 6 DOF motion trajectory of an object manipulated by a human. As a first step in the recognition process, 3D measured position trajectories of arbitrary and uncalibrated points attached to the rigid body are transformed to an invariant, coordinate-free representation of the rigid body motion trajectory. This invariant representation is independent of the reference frame in which the motion is observed, the chosen marker positions, the linear scale (magnitude) of the motion, the time scale and the velocity profile along the trajectory. Two classification algorithms which use the invariant representation as input are developed and tested experimentally: one approach based on a Dynamic TimeWarping algorithm, and one based on Hidden Markov Models. Both approaches yield high recognition rates (up to 95 % and 91 %, respectively). The advantage of the invariant approach is that motion trajectories observed in different contexts (with different reference frames, marker positions, time scales, linear scales, velocity profiles) can be compared and averaged, which allows us to build models from multiple demonstrations observed in different contexts, and use these models to recognize similar motion trajectories in still different contexts.",19

In our approach, the door recognition is transformed into the classification problem of feature points, which can be done quickly enough to conduct it on-line. The knob is extracted by a segmentation method and a few thresholds: blob size, blob ratio, and the distance from the floor. We show in the experiment that our humanoid robot can recognize a door and its knob reliably and quickly.",11
icra,None,A Gaussian measurement model for local interest point based 6 DOF pose estimation,"Thilo Grundmann,Wendelin Feiten,Georg v. Wichert,","One of the main challenges for service robots during operation lies in the handling of unavoidable uncertainties which originate from model and sensor inaccuracies and which are characteristic for realistic application scenarios. Robustness under real world conditions can only be achieved when the dominant uncertainties are explicitly represented and purposefully managed by the robot's control system. We therefore adopt a probabilistic approach in which perception is regarded as a sequential estimation process and follow a Bayesian filtering methodology. Under these assumptions probabilistic models of the robot's perception systems are key. In this paper we shortly describe a model based object recognition and localization system. However, we do not not focus on the 6D pose estimation procedure itself, but on the method to quantify and compute the uncertainty associated with it. We construct a Gaussian approximation of the resulting pose error using the implicit function theorem. It is then used as a proposal density for importance sampling. Our goal is to sample from the measurement model describing 6D object localization based on local features in a Bayesian filtering context.",13
icra,None,Using prioritized relaxations to locate objects in points clouds for manipulation,"Robert Truax,Robert Platt,John Leonard,","This paper considers the problem of identifying objects of interest in laser range point clouds for the purposes of manipulation. One of the characteristics of perception for manipulation is that while it is unnecessary to label all objects in the scene, it may be very important to maximize the likelihood of correctly locating a desired object. This paper leverages this and proposes an approach for locating the most likely object configurations given an object parameterization and a point cloud. While many other approaches to object localization need to explicitly associate points with hypothesized objects, our proposed method avoids this by optimizing relaxations of the likelihood function rather than the exact likelihood. The result is a simple, efficient, and robust method for locating objects that makes few assumptions beyond the desired object parameterization and with few parameters that require tuning.",8
icra,None,Bilateral telemanipulation: Improving the complementarity of the frequency- and time-domain passivity approaches,"Michel Franken,Bert Willaert,Sarthak Misra,Stefano Stramigioli,","Passivity of bilateral telemanipulation systems ensures stability of the interaction with such systems. In the frequency domain, passivity of a linear time invariant approximation of the system can be designed for a considered set of operating conditions. Non-linear control structures have been proposed that enforce passivity of the system in the time domain. In this paper, extensions are proposed that increase the complimentarity of the frequency- and time domain approaches. The combination of both approaches allows a guaranteed measure of transparency to be designed in the frequency domain for a desired set of operating conditions. For operating conditions outside the desired set, stable interaction is guaranteed by the non-linear passivity enforcing control structure. Simulation results of the combined approach are presented that show that the stability properties of the bilateral controller designed in the frequency domain are improved and the transparency properties are improved with respect to those of the standard passivity-enforcing algorithm in the time domain.",11
icra,None,On the use of shunt impedances versus bounded environment passivity for teleoperation systems,"B. Willaert,M. Franken,H. Van Brussel,E.B. Vander Poorten,","This paper analyses and compares two passivity-based approaches that allow to include a-priori knowledge on the dynamic range of the human operator and/or the environment. This can lead to less conservative teleoperation systems compared to systems designed to be purely passive or absolutely stable. The first approach under investigation is a method where the absolute stability is analysed of a teleoperation system augmented with shunt impedances in series and/or parallel with the teleoperation system. It is shown that the traditional interpretation of the use of shunt impedances is not valid and a more accurate description of how to use this method is presented. The second approach under investigation is the bounded environment (operator) method. It is shown that the original idea to restrict the analysis to the so-called worst-case scenarios of a pure mass and a pure stiffness as environment can be too simplistic. Illustrative examples with mass-spring-damper systems fixed to the ground and floating objects as environments are made to demonstrate this in detail. In conclusion, this paper shows that embedding environment knowledge into the controller analysis/design is not straightforward and further research should be dedicated to determine which bounds should be used to obtain practically stable systems for different applications.",10
icra,None,Feedback r-passivity of Lagrangian systems for mobile robot teleoperation,"Dongjun Lee,Daye Xu,","One of the key challenges in mobile robot teleoperation is master-slave kinematic dissimilarity: master device (e.g., joystick) has a bounded workspace, while slave mobile robot can/should cover an unbounded workspace. A direct master-position/slave-velocity coupling has been frequently used for this, which, yet, in general, violates passivity of the closed-loop system, since the master system with position output cannot be passive. In this paper, we propose a new notion of feedback r-passivity of general multi-dimensional Lagrangian systems, which allows us to achieve such master-position/slave-velocity coupling while enforcing passivity. Its applications to tele-driving of dynamic and kinematic WMRs with constant communication delay are also presented.",44
icra,None,A novel shared structure for dual user systems with unknown time-delay utilizing adaptive impedance control,"M. Shahbazi,H.A. Talebi,S. F. Atashzar,F. Towhidkhah,R. V. Patel,,","In this paper, a novel decentralized multilateral structure is proposed for the dual user systems in the presence of communication delay. The proposed structure utilizes adaptive impedance control approach in order to overcome the destructive effect of the time-delay on system desired-objectives, which is a disregarded issue in the previous studies on dual user system. The proposed control strategy, which utilizes three desired impedance surfaces defined in the paper, satisfactorily brings the system hybrid matrix close to the ideal one that guarantees the system stability and transparency. The controller is designed in a way that eliminates the necessity of the delay estimation as one of its outstanding characteristics; consequently, the unknown communication time-delay can be handled via this structure while previous studies have disregarded the issue of time delay in dual user system. Furthermore, the adaptive structure of the controller promises to overcome the uncertainties on robot's dynamics. In addition, the efficiency of the controller in guaranteeing the system stability in the presence of unknown communication delay is investigated through passivity theory and the presented analysis illustrates complete independency of the closed-loop system stability on time delay value applying the proposed controller. Experimental results performed on a delayed dual user system demonstrate validity of the proposed scheme.",24
icra,None,Design and implementation of selectable sound separation on the Texai telepresence system using HARK,"Takeshi Mizumoto,Kazuhiro Nakadai,Takami Yoshida,Ryu Takeda,,,,","This paper presents the design and implementation of selectable sound separation functions on the telepresence system ""Texai"" using the robot audition software ""HARK."" An operator of Texai can ""walk"" around a faraway office to attend a meeting or talk with people through video-conference instead of meeting in person. With a normal microphone, the operator has difficulty recognizing the auditory scene of the Texai, e.g., he/she cannot know the number and the locations of sounds. To solve this problem, we design selectable sound separation functions with 8 microphones in two modes, overview and filter modes, and implement them using HARK's sound source localization and separation. The overview mode visualizes the direction-of-arrival of surrounding sounds, while the filter mode provides sounds that originate from the range of directions he/she specifies. The functions enable the operator to be aware of a sound even if it comes from behind the Texai, and to concentrate on a particular sound. The design and implementation was completed in five days due to the portability of HARK. Experimental evaluations with actual and simulated data show that the resulting system localizes sound sources with a tolerance of 5 degrees.",62
icra,None,First-exit model predictive control of fast discontinuous dynamics: Application to ball bouncing,"Paul Kulchenko,Emanuel Todorov,","We extend model-predictive control so as to make it applicable to robotic tasks such as legged locomotion, hand manipulation and ball bouncing. The online optimal control problem is defined in a first-exit rather than the usual finite-horizon setting. The exit manifold corresponds to changes in contact state. In this way the need for online optimization through dynamic discontinuities is avoided. Instead the effects of discontinuities are incorporated in a final cost which is tuned offline. The new method is demonstrated on the task of 3D ball bouncing. Even though our robot is mechanically limited, it bounces one ball robustly and recovers from a wide range of disturbances, and can also bounce two balls with the same paddle. This is possible due to intelligent responses computed online, without relying on pre-existing plans.",37
icra,None,"Closed-loop belief space planning for linear, Gaussian systems","Michael P. Vitus,Claire J. Tomlin,","This paper considers the problem of motion planning for linear, Gaussian systems, and extends existing chance constrained optimal control solutions [1], [2] by incorporating the closed-loop uncertainty of the system and by reducing the conservativeness in the constraints. Due to the imperfect knowledge of the system state caused by motion uncertainty and sensor noise, the constraints cannot be guaranteed to be satisfied and consequently must be considered probabilistically. In this work, they are formulated as convex constraints on a univariate Gaussian random variable, with the violation probability of all the constraints guaranteed to be below a threshold. This threshold is a tuning parameter which trades off the performance of the system and the conservativeness of the solution. In contrast to similar methods, the proposed work considers the specific estimator and controller used in the closed-loop system in order to directly characterize the a priori distribution of the closed-loop system state. Using this distribution, a convex optimization program is formulated to solve for the optimal solution for the closed-loop system. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated through several examples.",76

We present in this paper a systematic approach for generating robust motion control strategies to satisfy high level specifications of safety, target attainability, and invariance, under unknown but bounded, continuous disturbances. The motion planning task is decomposed into the two sub-problems of finite horizon reach with avoid and infinite horizon invariance. The set of states for which each of the sub-problems is robustly feasible is computed via iterative reachability calculations under a differential game framework. We discuss how the results of this computation can be used to inform selections of control inputs based upon state measurements at run-time and provide an algorithm for implementing the corresponding feedback control policies. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental application of this method to the control of an autonomous helicopter in tracking a moving ground vehicle.",72

A simple model for a single degree of freedom flexible manipulator is derived and a control scheme is chosen and implemented. The latter includes a robust non-linear estimator. Simulation and preliminary experimental results are presented that demonstrate the validity of the proposed control scheme.,10
icra,None,Control of rhythmic robotic movements through synchronization with human muscle activity,"Tadej Petrič,Andrej Gams,Martin Tomšič,Leon Žlajpah,","We address the problem of extracting the fundamental frequency of an arbitrary periodic or quasi-periodic signal for application in robotic tasks. We focus on controlling periodic robotic movement by extracting the frequency of human movement by using surface electromyography (EMG), a technique by which muscle action potentials are gathered by electrodes placed on the skin. However, since the EMG signal is quasi-periodic with a lot of frequency components and noise, it is difficult to determine the frequency and phase of the measured limb motion. We propose to use nonlinear dynamical systems capable of extracting the frequency and the phase from an unknown periodic signal with an arbitrary waveform. The method uses a whole Fourier series representation in a feedback loop. It is capable of extracting the frequency and the phase of an unknown periodic signal in real-time, without any additional signal processing or preprocessing. Combining this method with an output dynamic system based on dynamic movement primitives, which generate the desired trajectory, allows synchronization between human muscles actions and some other system actions like robot motion or electrical neuromuscular stimulator activation.",8

icra,None,Autonomous rover traverse and precise arm placement on remotely designated targets,"Michael Fleder,Issa A. Nesnas,Mihail Pivtoraiko,Alonzo Kelly,Richard Volpe,","Exploring planetary surfaces typically involves traversing challenging and unknown terrain and acquiring insitu measurements at designated locations using arm-mounted instruments. We present field results for a new implementation of an autonomous capability that enables a rover to traverse and precisely place an arm-mounted instrument on remote targets. Using point-and-click mouse commands, a scientist designates targets in the initial imagery acquired from the rover's mast cameras. The rover then autonomously traverses the rocky terrain for a distance of 10 - 15 m, tracks the target(s) of interest during the traverse, positions itself for approaching the target, and then precisely places an arm-mounted instrument within 2-3 cm from the originally designated target. The rover proceeds to acquire science measurements with the instrument. This work advances what has been previously developed and integrated on the Mars Exploration Rovers by using algorithms that are capable of traversing more rock-dense terrains, enabling tight thread-the-needle maneuvers. We integrated these algorithms on the newly refurbished Athena Mars research rover and fielded them in the JPL Mars Yard. We conducted 43 runs with targets at distances ranging from 5 m to 15 m and achieved a success rate of 93% for placement of the instrument within 2-3 cm.",7

icra,None,Control of a space robot with flexible members,"Payam Zarafshan,S. Ali. A. Moosavian,","Dynamics and control of a space robotic system with flexible members during an object manipulation task is studied here. Flexible members such as solar panels of space free flying robotic systems and their flexible joints during a manoeuvre may get stimulated and vibrate. Therefore, such vibrations will cause some oscillatory disturbance forces on the moving base and manipulated object, which in turn produces error in the position and speed of the manipulating end effectors. These flexible members are classified into active and passive elements, to study the ways of controlling the vibration effects of such members. In this paper, considering a multiple arm space robotic system with flexible joints and flexible solar panels, the system dynamics is partitioned into two rigid and flexible bodies' motion, and a practical model for control implementations on compounded rigid-flexible multi-body systems is developed. Then, based on a designated path/trajectory for a space robotic system, the multiple impedance control is extended to perform an object manipulation task by such complicated rigid-flexible multi body systems. Finally, a space free flying robotic system is simulated which contains two 2-DOF planar manipulators with flexible joints, and a rotating antenna and a camera as its third and fourth arm, appended with two solar panels. Obtained results reveal the merits of proposed controller to successfully perform the manipulation task and effectively suppress the vibration of flexible elements which will be discussed.",17
icra,None,Assistance control of wheelchair operation using active cast for the upper limb,"Eiichi Ohara,Tatsuya Watanabe,Takeshi Oishi,Takaaki Aoki,Yutaka Nishimoto,,","Many people of all ages have sustained cervical cord injury in traffic accidents or sport accidents, and con sequently suffered physical impairment. For individuals with paralysis of the lower limb who have also lost the ability to extend the elbow, many motions become difficult to perform in daily life, for example, independently operating a wheelchair or pushing open doors. In the future, wearable assist robots are expected to be incorporated into daily life. In order to be wearable, the assist robot must not limit the user's range of motion while being carried or used, and must be suitable for a wide range of situations. In this study, we developed an assist robot for upper limb movement which can assist wheelchair operation. To achieve this, we constructed a model of the upper limb during wheelchair operation with a manipulating force ellipsoid, and we developed an assistance control method for the upper limb using the device to apply force vectors. The effectiveness of the developed system is demonstrated experimentally.",11

The system is based on estimating how much help the person needs at each situation and providing just the correct amount. This is achieved by combining robot and human control commands in a reactive fashion after weighting them by their respective local efficiency. Thus, the better the person drives, the more control he/she is awarded with. In order to predict how much help users may need in advance rather than waiting for them to decrease in efficiency, their skills to deal with each situation are estimated with respect to a baseline driver profile to increase assistance when needed. Situations are characterized at reactive level to keep a reduced set. This profile has been extracted from real traces of more than 70 inpatients presenting different physical and cognitive skills via clustering.

icra,None,Task-dependent impedance improves user performance with a virtual prosthetic arm,"Amy Blank,Allison M. Okamura,Louis L. Whitcomb,","Recent studies of neuromotor control have shown that humans modulate the impedance of their arms for different tasks, motivating the development of a prosthetic arm with user-selectable impedance characteristics. While impedance control has been extensively studied in robotics, prosthetic arms present a unique combination of human and robotic control, in which human capabilities and preferences play an important role. To understand the desirable impedance characteristics of prosthetic arms, we studied human control of a one-degree of-freedom virtual prosthetic limb with variable stiffness and damping in tasks involving (1) force minimization and (2) trajectory tracking. Subjects performed best with different patterns of impedance modulation depending on task goals and available feedback, suggesting that the ability to modulate the impedance of a prosthetic limb may be beneficial to the wearer. The results of this study inform the future design of prosthetic limbs in which the wearer can vary limb impedance to improve performance in a variety of manipulation tasks.",23
icra,None,Control of upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton based on motion intention recognition,"Weiguang Huo,Jian Huang,Yongji Wang,Jun Wu,Lei Cheng,","Recognizing the user motion intention plays an important role in the study of power-assist robots. An intention-guided control strategy is proposed for the upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton. A force sensor system comprised of force sensing resistors (FSRs) is designed to online estimate the motion intention of user upper limb. A new concept called ""intentional reaching direction (IRD)"" is proposed to quantitatively describe this intention. Both the state model and the observation model of IRD are obtained by enumerating the upper limb behavior modes and analyzing the relationship between the measured force signals and the motion intention. Based on these two models, the IRD can be online inferred by applying filtering technology. Guided by the estimated IRD, an admittance control strategy is assumed to control the motions of three DC motors in the joints of the robotic arm. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is finally confirmed by the experiments on a 3-DOF robotic exoskeleton.",36

This paper presents a novel approach for joining of several dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) based on a modification of the original formulation for DMPs. The new method produces smooth and natural transitions in position as well as velocity space. The properties of the method are demonstrated by applying it to simulated handwriting generation implemented on a robot, where an adaptive algorithm is used to learn trajectories from human demonstration. These results demonstrate that the new method is a feasible alternative for trajectory learning and generation and its accuracy and modular character has potential for various robotics applications.",5

However, it is also inherently difficult to attain. We propose a novel approach to achieve maximal clearance by exploiting the ability of evenly distributing a set of points by a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT). We adapt the CVT framework to multi agent motion planning by adding an extra time dimension and optimize the trajectories of the agents in the augmented domain. As an optimization framework, our method can work naturally on complex regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in achieving maximal clearance in motion planning with some examples.",2
icra,None,A tuned approach to feedback motion planning with RRTs under model uncertainty,"Guilherme J. Maeda,Surya P. N. Singh,Hugh Durrant-Whyte,","Model uncertainty complicates most kinodynamic motion planning and control approaches due to their reliance on accurate forward prediction. If the model uncertainty is significant, a generated path or control strategy based on forward simulation of this model is potentially invalid and expensive to track (if possible). This paper explores the use of system identification/estimation to tune model parameters. Framed as an extension to rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) methods, it updates the model so that reachable actions added to the tree have more fidelity. This can be viewed as a mixture of a model predictive control (MPC) for local planning with an approximate-model global planner providing sub-goals and thus overcoming the limited lookahead caused by model uncertainty. The benefits of this approach are illustrated for a 3 DOF serial manipulator controlled by computed torque control operating under large external disturbances. In this case, the approach provides operation under intermittent feedback and disturbance observation. Tracking and actuator utilization are also improved over solutions found via conventional methods.",8
icra,None,How many landmark colors are needed to avoid confusion in a polygon?,"Lawrence H. Erickson,Steven M. LaValle,","Suppose that two members of a finite point guard set S within a polygon P must be given different colors if their visible regions overlap, and that every point in P is visible from some point in S. The chromatic art gallery problem, introduced in [7], asks for the minimum number of colors required to color any guard set (not necessarily a minimal guard set) of P. We study two related problems. First, given a polygon P and a guard set S of P, can the members of S be efficiently and optimally colored so that no two members of S that have overlapping visibility regions have the same color? Second, given a polygon P and a set of candidate guard locations N, is it possible to efficiently and optimally choose the guard set S ⊆ N that requires the minimum number of colors? We provide an algorithm that solves the first question in polynomial time, and demonstrate the NP-hardness of the second question. Both questions are motivated by common robot tasks such as mapping and surveillance.",9
icra,None,Optimal sensor placement for underwater positioning with uncertainty in the target location,"D. Moreno-Salinas,A. M. Pascoal,J. Aranda,","Worldwide, there has been increasing interest in the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to drastically change the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation. Representative missions include marine habitat mapping, pipeline inspection, and archaeological surveying. Central to the operation of some classes of AUVs is the availability of good underwater positioning systems to localize one or more vehicles simultaneously based on information received on-board a support ship or a set of autonomous surface vehicles. In an interesting operational scenario the AUV is equipped with an acoustic pinger and the set of surface vehicles carry a network of acoustic receivers that measure the ranges between the emitter and each of the receivers. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of an acoustic sensor network at the ocean surface that will maximize the range-related information available for underwater target positioning. It is assumed that the range measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, the variance of which is distance-dependent. Furthermore, we also assume that an initial estimate of the target position is available, albeit with uncertainty. The Fisher Information Matrix and the maximization of its determinant are used to determine the sensor configuration that yields the most accurate “expected” positioning of the target, the position of which is expressed by a probabilistic distribution. It is shown that the optimal configuration lends itself to an interesting geometrical interpretation and that the “spreading” of the sensor configuration depends explicitly on the intensity of the range measurement noise, the probabilistic distribution that defines the target position, and the target depth. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived.",42

icra,None,Feasibility grids for localization and mapping in crowded urban scenes,"Shao-Wen Yang,Chieh-Chih Wang,","Localization and mapping are fundamental tasks in mobile robotics. State-of-the-arts often rely on the static world assumption using the occupancy grids. However, the real environment is typically dynamic. We propose the feasibility grids to facilitate the representation of both the static scene and the moving objects. The dual sensor models are introduced to discriminate between stationary and moving objects in mobile robot localization. Instead of estimating the occupancy states, the feasibility grids maintain the stochastic estimates of the feasibility (crossability) states of the environment. Given that an observation can be decomposed into stationary objects and moving objects, incorporating the feasibility grids in localization yields performance improvements over the occupancy grids, particularly in highly dynamic environments. Our approach is extensively evaluated using real data acquired with a planar laser range finder. The experimental results show that the feasibility grid is capable of rapid convergence and robust performance in mobile robot localization by taking into account moving object information. A root mean squares accuracy of within 50 cm is achieved, without the aid of GPS, which is sufficient for autonomous navigation in crowded urban scenes. The empirical results suggest that the performance of localization can be improved when handling the changing environment explicitly. I.",35

The USBL is operated in a standard configuration, with the transponder onboard the AUV and the transceiver on the sea surface. Hence, position fixes are fed back to the AUV through an acoustic modem. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used for the Multi Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). The clocks of the AUV and the USBL-computer are synchronized, and a bounded circular buffer of past vehicle poses is kept to project the received USBL position fix, to update the corresponding time step producing a delayed position fix. The method is validated using a data set gathered for a dam inspection task.",29
icra,None,Adaptive Bearing Sampling for a Constant-Time Surfacing A* path planning algorithm for gliders,"Enrique Fernández-Perdomo,Jorge Cabrera-Gámez,Daniel Hernández-Sosa,,,,,","Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are commonly used in Oceanography due to their relative low cost and wide range of capabilities. Gliders are a type of UUV particularly suitable for long-range missions because of their large autonomy. They change their buoyancy to dive and climb describing a vertical saw tooth pattern, which produces an effective but low horizontal speed. Consequently, gliders are strongly sensitive to ocean currents, so they might have to adapt the heading to the current field. In this article we outline a novel path planning algorithm for gliders using ocean currents. It bases on the A* family of algorithms and incorporates a probabilistic framework. Our approach intends to alleviate some of the drawbacks that A* has with the problem at hand. Instead of discretizing the search space, a set of bearing angles is sampled at each surfacing point and the glider trajectory is integrated. We propose an Adaptive Bearing Sampling (ABS) procedure which reduces the computational time with low impact on the results, as shown by the tests run with ocean currents of a Regional Ocean Model.",11

According to this theory, we can reconstruct compressible fields using O(log n) nonadaptive measurements (where n is the number of sites of the spatial domain), in a basis that is ""in coherent"" to the representation basis [1]; random uncorrelated measurements satisfy this incoherence requirement. Because an autonomous vehicle is kinematically constrained and has finite energy and communication resources, it is an open question how to best design missions for CS reconstruction. We compare a two-dimensional random walk, a TSP approximation to pass through random points, and a randomized boustrophedon (lawnmower) strategy. Not unexpectedly, all three approaches can yield comparable reconstruction performance if the planning horizons are long enough; if planning occurs only over short time scales, the random walk will have an advantage.",28

We propose a two-tier controller that is simple and intuitive, which directly controls the curvature of the trailer's trajectory. It allows the control input to be more directly related to path specification and handles path curvature discontinuity better. A side-slope compensator is designed upon the simple controller to prevent side-slope from deteriorating tracking performance.

icra,None,Efficient AUV navigation fusing acoustic ranging and side-scan sonar,"Maurice F. Fallon,Michael Kaess,Hordur Johannsson,John J.

The approach integrates the global constraints of range to and GPS position of a surface vehicle or buoy communicated via acoustic modems and relative pose constraints arising from targets detected in side-scan sonar images. The approach utilizes an efficient optimization algorithm, iSAM, which allows for consistent on-line estimation of the entire set of trajectory constraints. The optimized trajectory can then be used to more accurately navigate the AUV, to extend mission duration, and to avoid GPS surfacing. As iSAM provides efficient access to the marginal covariances of previously observed features, automatic data association is greatly simplified - particularly in sparse marine environments. A key feature of our approach is its intended scalability to single surface sensor (a vehicle or buoy) broadcasting its GPS position and simultaneous one-way travel time range (OWTT) to multiple AUVs. We discuss why our approach is scalable as well as robust to modem transmission failure. Results are provided for an ocean experiment using a Hydroid REMUS 100 AUV co-operating with one of two craft: an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a manned support vessel.

One main innovation of the robot is the capability to measure heavy metals concentrations directly onboard using sensors ad hoc developed by the consortium. This enables the system to provide real-time measurements of heavy metals concentrations potentially changing the current water monitoring methodology in which the samples are collected by a dedicated boat and analyzed in laboratory. The robot is designed for long range missions and for lodging the onboard water analysis system.

A setup optimization process that not only considers the surgery requirements but also considers the robot performance is proposed in the paper. In this process, incisions are chosen carefully by surgeons based on surgical requirements before surgery. The position of the robot relative to the incision is predetermined by maximizing the Global Conditioning Index (GCI) within the moving ranges of the joints. The posture of the robot is optimized also by maximizing the GCI and meets a set of performance constraints. This optimization process is repeated until the robot can reach all the surgical sites.

icra,None,An approach to ulta-tightly coupled data fusion for handheld input devices in robotic surgery,"Andreas Tobergte,Mihai Pomarlan,Georg Passig,Gerd Hirzinger,","This paper introduces an ultra-tightly coupled approach to data fusion of optical and inertial measurements. The two redundant sensor systems complement each other well, with the cameras providing absolute positions and the inertial measurements giving low latency information of derivatives. The targeted application is the tracking of handheld input devices for robotic surgery, where landmarks are not always visible to all cameras. Especially when bi-manual operation is considered, where one hand can move between the other hand and a camera, occlusions occur frequently. The ultra-tighly coupled data fusion uses 2D-camera measurements to correct pose estimations in an extended Kalman filter without an explicit 3D-reconstruction. Therefore marker measurements are used to support the pose estimation, even if the marker is only visible in one camera. Experiments were done with an inertial measurement unit and rectified stereo cameras that show the advantage of the approach for the application.",8
icra,None,Electromyographic evaluation of therapeutic massage effect using multi-finger robot hand,"Ren C. Luo,Chih C. Chang,","The multi-finger robot hand (IRA-Hand I) is specially designed for massage applications. Surface electromyographic (SEMG) evaluation of therapeutic massage effects using multi-finger robot hand are presented in this paper. After an isometric 50% MVC (maximum voluntary contraction) of human back muscles is performed for 90 seconds, SEMG signals of the subject show a muscular fatigue. A grasp-kneading massage by the robot hand is applied on the subject's shoulder for recovering from muscular fatigue. To evaluate the therapeutic effects of massage, the SEMG signals measured from the trapezius muscles before and after the massage therapy are analyzed. Electrical activity (EA) and median frequency (MF) of the SEMG signals are calculated as indexes of the muscle physiological states. The experimental results show that EA increases from the occurrence of fatigue, while MF shifts towards lower frequency in the spectral distribution. After massage, a decrease in EA and an increase in MF are observed which demonstrate the effectiveness of recovery through the grasp-kneading massage by the robot hand. In addition, the joint analysis of EMG spectrum and amplitude (JASA), which considers the changes in time domain and in frequency domain simultaneously, verifies that the therapeutic massage recovers the trapezius muscle from fatigue effectively. For comparison, the experiments with a massage specialist performing the massage therapy are conducted with the same procedures. It is evidenced that the robot hand massage has even better effectiveness than the human hand in most cases.",14

In the present paper, the concept behind a novel medical support system that integrates therapy and diagnostics (theragnostics) is illustrated. The re quired functions for the proposed system are discussed and an overview of the constructed system configuration is illustrated. The problems associated with kidney stone motion tracking by ultrasonography are described. In order to overcome these problems, we consider two approaches. The first approach is to minimize the servoing error so as to enhance both the efficiency of the therapy and the safety of the patient. The second approach is to reduce the effect of the servoing error. With respect to the first approach, we propose a robust detection method of the stone position based on shape information. With respect to the second approach, we propose a solution for controlling the HIFU irradiation power in accordance with the servoing error, primarily in order to enhance the safety of the patient.",26
icra,None,A new information theoretic approach for appearance-based navigation of non-holonomic vehicle,"Amaury Dame,Eric Marchand,","In this paper we propose a new way to achieve a navigation task for a non-holonomic vehicle. We consider an image-based navigation process. We show that it is possible to navigate along a visual path without relying on the extraction, matching and tracking of geometric visual features such as keypoint. The new proposed approach relies directly on the information (entropy) contained in the image signal. We show that it is possible to build a control law directly from the maximisation of the shared information between the current image and the next key image in the visual path. The shared information between those two images are obtained using mutual information that is known to be robust to illumination variations and occlusions. Moreover the generally complex task of features extraction and matching is avoided. Both simulations and experiments on a real vehicle are presented and show the possibilities and advantages offered by the proposed method.",16
icra,None,Monocular model-based 3D vehicle tracking for autonomous vehicles in unstructured environment,"Michael Manz,Thorsten Luettel,Felix von Hundelshausen,Hans-Joachim Wuensche,","In this paper we describe a novel approach to model-based monocular vehicle tracking out of a moving vehicle using active vision. The designed algorithm can cope with cluttered color images, complex lighting conditions as well as partial occlusion of the leading vehicle and is able to detect and track a vehicle even within unstructured offroad environments. Thanks to the used 3D model which describes the characteristic vehicle geometry and appearance in terms of vertexes, edges and colored surfaces, no special visual markers are required. The knowledge of vehicle's geometry and appearance gained from the model are used within a particle filter to estimate the 6DoF position relative to the ego vehicle, thereby fusing edge as well as color information. We successfully use the proposed algorithm for pure vision based autonomous offroad convoy driving.",54

All algorithms run exclusively on the vehicle's on-board computer, and at high frequencies that allow the MAV to react quickly to obstacles appearing in its flight trajectory. Our MAV platform is a quadrotor aircraft equipped with an inertial measurement unit and two stereo rigs. An obstacle mapping algorithm processes stereo images, producing a 3D map representation of the environment; at the same time, a dynamic anytime path planner plans a collision-free path to a goal point.",140
icra,None,Kinodynamic planning for visual servoing,"Moslem Kazemi,Mehran Mehrandezh,Kamal Gupta,","In this paper we incorporate a randomized kinodynamic path planning approach with image-based control for a robotic arm equipped with an in-hand camera in a servoing task. The proposed approach yields C 2 -smooth camera trajectories by taking camera dynamics into account while accounting for a critical set of image and physical constraints. The proposed planner explores the camera state space (i.e., a space of camera poses and velocities) for permissible trajectories by iteratively extending a search tree in this space and simultaneously tracking these trajectories in the robot configuration space (i.e., joint space). The planned camera trajectories are then projected into the image space to obtain desired feature trajectories. In the execution stage an image-based visual servoing scheme is then adopted to track the feature trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been experimentally demonstrated on a robotic arm with an in-hand camera executing servoing tasks in complex environments.",14
icra,None,A multi-hypothesis constraint network optimizer for maximum likelihood mapping,"Dario Lodi Rizzini,Stefano Caselli,","Loop closure is one of the most difficult task in localization and mapping problems since it suffers from perceptual aliasing. Multi-hypothesis topological SLAM algorithms have been developed to exploit connectivity and disambiguate such difficult task. In this paper, we propose a multi-hypothesis constraint network algorithm that tracks multiple map topologies and simultaneously keeps metric information. The map is stored as a graph consisting of poses and constraints and each constraint is associated to a loop closure hypothesis. Hypotheses are stored in a hypothesis tree that is expanded whenever possible loop closure may occur. Network poses are computed according to the most likely topological configuration, but alternative pose values are also computed for the poses that are adjacent to a hypothesis constraint to recover quickly the new configuration when required. Results provide a validation of the proposed approach.",2
icra,None,Path planning for autonomous soaring flight in dynamic wind fields,"Nicholas R.J. Lawrance,Salah Sukkarieh,","An autonomous aircraft capable of utilising soaring flight in a dynamic wind field could considerably extend flight duration by limiting the use of on-board energy for propulsion. While soaring flight is relatively well understood for known wind, an autonomous soaring aircraft would have to generate paths based only on local observations of the wind made during the flight. This paper presents a method to simultaneously map and utilise a wind field using Gaussian process regression to generate a spatio-temporal map of the wind, and a path planning and dynamic target assignment algorithm to generate energy-gain paths from the current wind estimate. The planning architecture is tested in simulation for dynamic wind fields and shows consistent energy gain through exploration and exploitation of the wind environment.",50
icra,None,Aerial SLAM with a single camera using visual expectation,"Michael J. Milford,Felix Schill,Peter Corke,Robert Mahony,Gordon Wyeth,","Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are a rapidly growing area of research and development in robotics. For autonomous robot operations, localization has typically been calculated using GPS, external camera arrays, or onboard range or vision sensing. In cluttered indoor or outdoor environments, onboard sensing is the only viable option. In this paper we present an appearance-based approach to visual SLAM on a flying MAV using only low quality vision. Our approach consists of a visual place recognition algorithm that operates on 1000 pixel images, a lightweight visual odometry algorithm, and a visual expectation algorithm that improves the recall of place sequences and the precision with which they are recalled as the robot flies along a similar path. Using data gathered from outdoor datasets, we show that the system is able to perform visual recognition with low quality, intermittent visual sensory data. By combining the visual algorithms with the RatSLAM system, we also demonstrate how the algorithms enable successful SLAM.",50

In such settings, it is necessary to allow for significant excursions of the attitude from the hover state and small angle approximations cannot be justified for the roll and pitch. We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.",1681

We allow for plans with a non-zero but bounded probability of violating constraints, a quantity that we define as risk and provide a solution technique that keeps the risk below a specified threshold while optimizing reward. We also use the decoupling between the dynamics of individual agents to assume transition independence and use this assumption to reduce the complexity of the problem. We provide representative simulation results to show that our technique achieves high reward while keeping risk bounded.",14
icra,None,Automated cell manipulation: Robotic ICSI,"Zhe Lu,Xuping Zhang,Clement Leung,Navid Esfandiari,Robert F. Casper,,","This paper is the first report of robotic ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection). ICSI is a clinical procedure performed worldwide in fertility clinics, requiring pick-up of a single sperm and insert it into oocyte (i.e., an egg cell). Since its invention 20 years ago, ICSI has been conducted manually by a handful of highly skilled embryologists; however, success rates vary significantly among clinics due to poor reproducibility and inconsistency across operators. We leverage our work in robotic cell injection to realize robotic ICSI and aim ultimately, to standardize how clinical ICSI is performed. This paper presents some of the technical aspects of our robotic ICSI system, including a cell holding device and motion control and computer vision algorithms. The system performs visual tracking of single sperm, robotic immobilization of sperm, aspiration of sperm with pico-liter volume, and insertion of sperm into an oocyte with a high degree of reproducibility. The system requires minimal human involvement (requiring only a few computer mouse clicking), and is human operator skill independent. Using the hamster oocyte-human sperm model in preliminary trials, the robotic system demonstrated a high success rate of 90.0% and survival rate of 90.7% (n=120).",12
icra,None,Multiscale search using probabilistic quadtrees,"Timothy H. Chung,Stefano Carpin,","We propose a novel framework to search for a static target using a multiscale representation. The algorithm we present is appropriate when the target detection sensor trades off accuracy versus covered area, e.g., when a UAV can fly and sense at different elevations. A structure based on quadtrees is used to propagate a posterior about the target location using a variable resolution representation that is dynamically refined in regions associated with higher probability of target presence. Probabilities are updated using a Bayesian approach accounting for erroneous sensor readings in the form of false positives and missed detections. The model we propose is coupled with a search and decision algorithm that determines where to sense next and with which accuracy. The search algorithm is based on an objective function accounting for both probability of detection and motion costs, thus aiming to minimize traveled distances while trying to localize the target. The paper is concluded with simulation results showing our approach outperforms commonly used methods based on uniform resolution grids.",30

Manually pipetting embryos into wells is tedious and time consuming. This paper reports a prototype cooperative robotic system capable of transferring zebrafish embryos in parallel and depositing a single embryo per well in a 96-well microplate. A cell holding device was developed to trap multiple embryos in a regular pattern. The cell holding device and a microplate are positioned and aligned along multiple axes by the system. Embryo release strategies were systematically studied and compared. Experiments demonstrated that out of the 1,056 zebrafish embryos used in experiments (i.e., 44 times parallel transfer into 11 96-well plates), 996 wells were successfully filled with one and only one zebrafish embryo, representing a success rate of 94.3%. Further experiments confirmed that the transferred embryos were able to develop into zebrafish with 100% survival rate.",1

A tour-taking robot autonomously follows a human guide through an environment, interpreting the guide's spoken utterances and the shared spatiotemporal context in order to acquire a spatially segmented and semantically labeled metrical-topological representation of the environment. The described tour-taking capability enables scalable deployment of mobile robots into human-occupied environments, and natural human-robot interaction for commanded mobility. Our primary contributions are an efficient, socially acceptable autonomous tour-following behavior and a tour interpretation algorithm that partitions a map into spaces labeled according to the guide's utterances. The tour-taking behavior is demonstrated in a multi-floor office building and evaluated by assessing the comfort of the tour guides, and by comparing the robot's map partitions to those produced by humans.",72

Campbell,","A novel method for controlling a mobile robot using qualitative inputs in the context of an approximate map, such as one sketched by a human, is presented. By defining a desired trajectory with respect to observable landmarks, human operators can send semi-autonomous robots into areas for which a truth map is not available. Waypoint planning is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, resulting in robot trajectories in the true environment that are qualitatively similar to those provided by the human. The algorithm is implemented both in simulation and on a mobile robot platform in several different environments. A sensitivity analysis is per formed, illustrating how the method is robust to uncertainties, even large sketch distortions, and allows the robot to adapt and re-plan according to its most current perception of the world.",10

Snider,Bakhtiar Litkouhi,","In this paper, a point-based Markov Decision Process (QMDP) algorithm is used for robust single-lane autonomous driving behavior control under uncertainties. Autonomous vehicle decision making is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), then extended to a QMDP framework. Based on MDP/QMDP, three kinds of uncertainties are taken into account: sensor noise, perception constraints and surrounding vehicles' behavior. In simulation, the QMDP-based reasoning framework makes the autonomous vehicle perform with differing levels of conservativeness corresponding to different perception confidence levels. Road tests also indicate that the proposed algorithm helps the vehicle in avoiding potentially unsafe situations under these uncertainties. In general, the results indicate that the proposed QMDP-based algorithm makes autonomous driving more robust to limited sensing ability and occasional sensor failures.",72

In order to mitigate the difficulties of using a graphical model for modeling the contextual relationships among the 3-D points, we instead propose a multi-stage inference procedure to capture these relationships. More specifically, we train this procedure to use point cloud statistics and learn relational information (e.g., tree-trunks are below vegetation) over fine (point-wise) and coarse (region-wise) scales. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, that were obtained from different sensors, and demonstrate improved performance.",155

For accurate magnetic control, the position of the microrobots is required. In this paper, we extract the intraocular projection mapping and use it in the established CAD-model-based pose-estimation framework. Our algorithm requires no focus information. This is the first work that treats a complicated refractive imaging system, such as the eye, in a model-based localization framework.

Prior information can be obtained for many environments in many different ways. However, this information can be incomplete, out-of-date, or presented in a different form than that used by the robot. Therefore, we argue that prior information is most naturally modelled as sets of potential constraints that act between landmarks. We present an extension of GraphSLAM that incorporates these constraints. We illustrate the results in an experiment with a 3D laser scanner and demonstrate a significant improvement in performance.",15

icra,None,SLAM-based automatic extrinsic calibration of a multi-camera rig,"Gerardo Carrera,Adrien Angeli,Andrew J. Davison,","Cameras are often a good choice as the primary outward-looking sensor for mobile robots, and a wide field of view is usually desirable for responsive and accurate navigation, SLAMand relocalisation. While this can potentially be provided by a single omnidirectional camera, it can also be flexibly achieved by multiple cameras with standard optics mounted around the robot. However, such setups are difficult to calibrate. Here we present a general method for fully automatic extrinsic auto-calibration of a fixed multi camera rig, with no requirement for calibration patterns or other infrastructure, which works even in the case where the cameras have completely non-overlapping views. The robot is placed in a natural environment and makes a set of programmed movements including a full horizontal rotation and captures a synchronized image sequence from each camera. These sequences are processed individually with a monocular visual SLAM algorithm. The resulting maps are matched and fused robustly based on corresponding invariant features, and then all estimates are optimised full joint bundle adjustment, where we constrain the relative poses of the cameras to be fixed. We present results showing accurate performance of the method for various two and four camera configurations.",143

Here, we exploit the co-registration of the 3D point cloud with the available camera imagery to associate high dimensional feature descriptors such as scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) or speeded up robust features (SURF) to the 3D points. We first establish putative point correspondence in the high dimensional feature space and then use these correspondences in a random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework to obtain an initial rigid body transformation that aligns the two scans. This initial transformation is then refined in a generalized iterative closest point (ICP) framework. The proposed method is completely data driven and does not require any initial guess on the transformation.

The nanotool was modified by fluorescent dye for intracellular measurement. The nanotool was included in the fusogenic liposome. Membrane fusion of the liposome to the cell membrane was used for invasive cell injection of the nanotool. The liposome fuses to the cell in weak acidic condition. Local pH regulation inside the liposome was developed using photochromic chemical for selective cell injection of the nanotool. The nanotool was modified by Leuco crystal violet (LCV). LCV emits the proton by ultraviolet (UV) illumination. The emitted proton decreases the pH value in the liposome. This pH regulation is reversible by UV/VIS illumination. The liposome was manipulated by optical tweezers. After contact of the liposome to the cell, the liposome was adhered to the cell by UV induced membrane fusion.

icra,None,Electromigration-based deposition enabled by nanorobotic manipulation inside a transmission electron microscope,"Zheng Fan,Xinyong Tao,Xudong Cui,Xudong Fan,Xiaobin Zhang,,","Electromigration-based deposition (EMBD) is an additive nanolithography technology for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures. Key techniques for extending the capability of EMBD have been tackled experimentally including the deposition against a non-conductive surface, shape control of the as-deposited nanostructure, and continuous mass feeding. The process is based on nanofluidic mass delivery at the attogram scale from metal-filled carbon nanotubes (m@CNTs) using nanorobotic manipulation inside a transmission electron microscope. By attaching a conductive probe to the sidewall of the CNT, it has been shown that mass flow can be achieved regardless of the conductivity of the object surface. Experiments have shown the influence of heat sinks on the geometries of the deposits from EMBD. By modulating the relative position between the deposit and the heat sinks using dual probes, it has been possible to reshape the deposits. The limited mass encapsulated inside a CNT requires a frequent change of them for depositing large structures. To realize continuous feeding, a reservoir will be an excellent solution. We have observed that the copper inside the neighbor CNTs to the CNT injector can be sucked into the injector. Although the mechanism is not well understood yet, electromigration and atom-by-atom wall-passing-through may be responsible to this phenomenon. This observation enabled a new path for the design of an EMBD system As a general-purposed nanofabrication process, EMBD will enable a variety of applications such as nanorobotic arc welding and assembly, nanoelectrodes direct writing, and nanoscale metallurgy.",1
icra,None,Dynamic optimization of tendon tensions in biomorphically designed hands with rolling constraints,"Marco Gabiccini,Mirko Branchetti,Antonio Bicchi,","Biomorphic structures for robotic manipulation based on tendon-driven mechanisms have been considered in robotic design for several decades, since they provide lightweight end-effectors with high dynamics. Following this trend, many new robot designs have being proposed based on tendon driven systems. Quite noticeably, the most advanced ones include also higher kinematic pairs and unilateral types of constraints. In this paper, we present a general framework for modeling the above class of mechanical systems for robotic manipulation. Such systems, including biomorphically designed devices, consist of articulated limbs with redundant tendinous actuation and unilateral rolling constraints. Methods based on convex analysis are applied to attack this broader class of mechanisms, and are shown to provide a basis for the dynamic control of co-contraction and internal forces that guarantee the correct operation of the system, despite limited friction between contacting surfaces or object fragility. An algorithm is described and tested that integrates a computed torque law, and allows to control tendon actuators to ""optimally"" comply with the prescribed constraints.",7
icra,None,Varying body stiffness for aquatic locomotion,"Marc Ziegler,Matej Hoffmann,Juan Pablo Carbajal,Rolf Pfeifer,","Fish excel in their swimming capabilities. These result from a dynamic interplay of actuation, passive properties of fish body, and interaction with the surrounding fluid. In particular, fish are able to exploit wakes that are generated by objects in flowing water. A powerful demonstration that this is largely due to passive body properties are studies on dead trout. Inspired by that, we developed a multi joint swimming platform that explores the potential of a passive dynamic mechanism. The platform has one actuated joint only, followed by three passive joints whose stiffness can be changed online, individually, and can be set to an almost arbitrary nonlinear stiffness profile. In a set of experiments, using online optimization, we investigated how the platform can discover optimal stiffness distribution along its body in response to different frequency and amplitude of actuation. We show that a heterogeneous stiffness distribution each joint having a different value outperforms a homogeneous one in producing thrust. Furthermore, different gaits emerged in different settings of the actuated joint. This work illustrates the potential of online adaption of passive body properties, leading to optimized swimming, especially in an unsteady environment.",29
icra,None,A compact representation of locally-shortest paths and its application to a human-robot interface,"Abdullah Akce,Timothy Bretl,","The space of all possible paths through a finite dimensional configuration space is infinite-dimensional. Nevertheless, paths taken by ""real"" robotic systems often cluster on a finite-dimensional manifold that is embedded in this infinite dimensional space and that is governed by a principle of optimality. We take advantage of this property to enable a human user to efficiently specify a desired path for a robot moving through a planar workspace with polygonal obstacles using a sequence of noisy binary inputs, as might be derived from a brain-machine interface. First, we show that the space of all such paths having length that is bounded and locally minimal is homeomorphic to the unit disk. Second, we note that any path mapped to the interior of this disk is a subset of some other path mapped to its boundary. Third, we provide an optimal communication protocol by which the user can, with vanishing error probability, select a point on this boundary. Finally, we validate our approach in preliminary experiments with human subjects.",3

Abdulsadda,Xiaobo Tan,","Fish and aquatic amphibians use the lateral line system, consisting of arrays of hair-like neuromasts, as an important sensory organ for prey/predator detection, communication, and navigation. In this paper a novel bio-inspired artificial lateral line system is proposed for underwater robots and vehicles by exploiting the inherent sensing capability of ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs). Analogous to its biological counterpart, the IPMC-based lateral line processes the sensor signals through a neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed lateral line was validated in localization of underwater motion sources, including both a vibrating sphere (a dipole source) and a flapping foil. In particular, as a proof of concept, a prototype with Body Length (BL) of 8 cm, comprising five millimeter-scale IPMC sensors, was constructed and tested. Experimental results showed that the IPMC-based lateral line could localize the sources from 4-5 BLs away, with a localization error comparable to source placement resolution at the source sensor separation of 1 BL. In addition to the ease of fabrication, these results established the competitiveness of the proposed approach, in terms of both localization range and accuracy, against the state of the art in artificial lateral lines.",50

icra,None,A new quantitative performance index for low mobility parallel kinematic manipulators' accuracy,"Jinbo Shi,Zexiang Li,Yuanqing Wu,","Due to the effect of joint clearance and component flexibility ( joint or link), a parallel kinematic manipulator (PKM), with proposed motion type G ⊂ SE(3), may have undesirable (or uncompensatible) pose error beyond G at the end-effector, which would cause severe accuracy performance degeneration of the PKM. As such phenomenons have been discovered and verified in many researches, we proposed a new performance index, called “Type Error”, which could be applied to evaluate such undesirable errors. Specifically with this index, the largest translational/rotational pose error could be quantized and the worst case over the designed workspace can be predicted. A three-step method for general application is presented in details by case study of three kinds of translational PKM.",2

Utilizing parallel-kinematics configurations and flexure joints, the FPMs can achieve extremely high motion resolution and accuracy. In this work, we focus on the analysis and design of a 3-DOF (θ x - θ y - Z) zero-torsion FPM for nano-alignment applications. Among various possible zero-torsion parallel kinematics configurations, it is identified that the 3-legged Prismatic-Prismatic-Spherical (3PPS) is a suitable candidate. Based on the concept of instantaneous rotation, the critical kinematic design issues, such as displacement and workspace analyses, are addressed. With these analysis algorithms, the major kinematic parameters are readily determined to meet the task requirements. To achieve a large workspace, beam-based flexure joints are employed in the FPM design. As the beam based Universal (U) flexure joints are able to accommodate the required passive prismatic and spherical motions, each flexure PPS leg can be replaced by a simple flexure PU leg. A research prototype of the 3-DOF 3PU FPM has been developed, which achieves position and orientation resolutions of 20 nm and 0.05 arcsecond throughout a workspace of 5° × 5° × 5 mm, respectively.",33

Exterior rotor motors had higher motor constants and efficiency, but lower rated power compared with interior-rotor motors. They required less energy to perform typical robotic tasks. Four exterior-rotor motors were fabricated and compared with manufacturing data from the best existing brushless DC motors. The exterior-rotor motors had more than a 250% increase in stall torque density compared with the best known brushless DC motor (RoboDrive) and more than a 740% increase in stall torque density compared with more common motors such as those produced by MicroMo and Maxon.

The typical one is FMA (Flexible Microactuator), which realizes continuous bending motions like a human finger. In addition, we are recently interested in several novel functions appeared on soft mechanism surfaces such as repellency, hydrophily, friction, structural color, and adhesiveness, which are realized with micro scale soft structures fabricated on the surfaces. We believe novel additional functions can be realized by utilizing the deformability of the soft structures. In this paper, micro grating structures made from silicone rubber are reported. Because of its elastic property, it can realize changing structural color. The experimental results show that beautiful color change can be observed. We fabricate a soft micro grating structure on FMA and confirm the appearance of structural color, which changes in following FMA's motion. This color change indicates distributed information of the strain of FMA, which may be used for servo control of FMA in the future.",19
icra,None,Joint actuation based on highly dynamic torque transmission elements - concept and control approaches,"Daniel Kubus,David Inkermann,Thomas Vietor,Friedrich M. Wahl,","Electric motors clearly constitute the most common drive principle in robotics and mechatronics. Smart materials, however, offer considerably higher power-to-mass ratios than electric motors. If mechanical energy instead of electrical energy can be distributed through a system, highly dynamic and efficient torque transmission elements based on smart materials, e.g. piezoceramics, can be used to transmit torque from an input to an output element. Just like electric motors, they can thus provide position, velocity, and force-torque control of the output element. This paper introduces machine components, called adaptronic couplers, which can transmit variable torques highly dynamically from an input element to an output element employing static and/or dynamic friction. In the long run, systems (e.g. robots) based on these machine components are envisaged to compete with systems based on classic drive principles - especially electric motors - w.r.t. dynamics and power-to-mass-ratio. Apart from the concept itself, this paper addresses different control approaches and discusses their influence on energy consumption and wear. Moreover, various experimental results proving the basic concept are presented.",4
icra,None,Biologically inspired sensory motor control of a 2-link robotic arm actuated by McKibben muscles,"Sofiane Ouanezar,Frédéric Jean,Bertrand Tondu,Marc A. Maier,,,","This study focuses on biomimetic sensory motor control of a robotic arm. We have developed a command circuit that was mathematically deduced from physical and mathematical constraints describing the function of cerebellar pathways. The control circuit contains an internal predictive model of the direct biomechanical function of the limb placed in a closed loop, so that the circuit computes an approximate inverse function. The structure of the model resembles the anatomic connectivity of the cerebellar pathways. In this paper, we present an application of this model to the control of a 2-link robotic arm actuated by four single-joint McKibben muscles and report the results obtained by simulation and real-time learning of 2 degrees of freedom pointing movements.",5

Morton,,","This paper presents a set of segmentation methods for various types of 3D point clouds. Segmentation of dense 3D data (e.g. Riegl scans) is optimised via a simple yet efficient voxelisation of the space. Prior ground extraction is empirically shown to significantly improve segmentation performance. Segmentation of sparse 3D data (e.g. Velodyne scans) is addressed using ground models of non-constant resolution either providing a continuous probabilistic surface or a terrain mesh built from the structure of a range image, both representations providing close to real-time performance. All the algorithms are tested on several hand labeled data sets using two novel metrics for segmentation evaluation.",523
icra,None,Choosing where to go: Complete 3D exploration with stereo,"Robbie Shade,Paul Newman,","This paper is about the autonomous acquisition of detailed 3D maps of a-priori unknown environments using a stereo camera - it is about choosing where to go. Our approach hinges upon a boundary value constrained partial differential equation (PDE) - the solution of which provides a scalar field guaranteed to have no local minima. This scalar field is trivially transformed into a vector field in which following lines of max flow causes provably complete exploration of the environment in full 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF). We use a SLAM system to infer the position of a stereo pair in real time and fused stereo depth maps to generate the boundary conditions which drive exploration. Our exploration algorithm is parameter free, is as applicable to 3D laser data as it is to stereo, is real time and is guaranteed to deliver complete exploration. We show empirically that it performs better than oft-used frontier based approaches and demonstrate our system working with real and simulated data.",108
icra,None,Highly accurate maximum likelihood laser mapping by jointly optimizing laser points and robot poses,"Michael Ruhnke,Rainer Kümmerle,Giorgio Grisetti,Wolfram Burgard,","In this paper we describe an algorithm for learning highly accurate laser-based maps that treats the overall mapping problem as a joint optimization problem over robot poses and laser points. We assume that a laser range finder senses points sampled from a regular surface and we utilize an improved likelihood function that accounts for two phenomena affecting the laser measurements that are often neglected: the conic shape of the laser beam and the incidence angle. To solve the entire problem we apply an optimization procedure that jointly adjusts the position of all the robot poses and all points in the scans. As a result, we obtain highly accurate maps. We evaluated our approach using simulated and real-world data and we show that utilizing the estimated maps greatly improves the localization accuracy of robots. The results furthermore suggest that the accuracy of the resulting map can exceed the resolution of the laser sensors used.",35
icra,None,Search in the real world: Active visual object search based on spatial relations,"A. Aydemir,K. Sjöö,J. Folkesson,A. Pronobis,P. Jensfelt,","Objects are integral to a robot's understanding of space. Various tasks such as semantic mapping, pick-and-carry missions or manipulation involve interaction with objects. Previous work in the field largely builds on the assumption that the object in question starts out within the ready sensory reach of the robot. In this work we aim to relax this assumption by providing the means to perform robust and large-scale active visual object search. Presenting spatial relations that describe topological relationships between objects, we then show how to use these to create potential search actions. We introduce a method for efficiently selecting search strategies given probabilities for those relations. Finally we perform experiments to verify the feasibility of our approach.",127
icra,None,Online dextrous-hand grasping force optimization with dynamic torque constraints selection,"Vincenzo Lippiello,Bruno Siciliano,Luigi Villani,","In this paper, a new algorithm for online grasping force optimization (GFO) of a dextrous robotic hand is presented. The GFO problem is cast in a convex optimization problem, considering also torque joint constraints. The proposed formulation allows to simplify the computational complexity of the problem by dynamically reducing the number of active torque constraints. Moreover, differently from other approaches, it does not require the evaluation of a new initial point at the beginning of each iteration. The effectiveness and the performance of the proposed method have been tested in a simulation case study where the hand manipulates a load with time-varying mass.",13
icra,None,Grasping with application to an autonomous checkout robot,"Ellen Klingbeil,Deepak Rao,Blake Carpenter,Varun Ganapathi,Andrew Y. Ng,,","In this paper, we present a novel grasp selection algorithm to enable a robot with a two-fingered end-effector to autonomously grasp unknown objects. Our approach requires as input only the raw depth data obtained from a single frame of a 3D sensor. Additionally, our approach uses no explicit models of the objects and does not require a training phase. We use the grasping capability to demonstrate the application of a robot as an autonomous checkout clerk. To perform this task, the robot must identify how to grasp an object, locate the barcode on the object and read the numeric code. We evaluate our grasping algorithm in experiments where the robot was required to autonomously grasp unknown objects. The robot achieved a success of 91.6%in grasping novel objects. We performed two sets of experiments to evaluate the checkout robot application. In the first set, the objects were placed in many orientations in front of the robot one at a time. In the second set, the objects were placed several at a time with varying amounts of clutter. The robot was able to autonomously grasp and scan the objects in 49/50 of the single-object trials and 46/50 of the cluttered trials.",117
icra,None,Gaussian process implicit surfaces for shape estimation and grasping,"Stanimir Dragiev,Marc Toussaint,Michael Gienger,","The choice of an adequate object shape representation is critical for efficient grasping and robot manipulation. A good representation has to account for two requirements: it should allow uncertain sensory fusion in a probabilistic way and it should serve as a basis for efficient grasp and motion generation. We consider Gaussian process implicit surface potentials as object shape representations. Sensory observations condition the Gaussian process such that its posterior mean defines an implicit surface which becomes an estimate of the object shape. Uncertain visual, haptic and laser data can equally be fused in the same Gaussian process shape estimate. The resulting implicit surface potential can then be used directly as a basis for a reach and grasp controller, serving as an attractor for the grasp end-effectors and steering the orientation of contact points. Our proposed controller results in a smooth reach and grasp trajectory without strict separation of phases. We validate the shape estimation using Gaussian processes in a simulation on randomly sampled shapes and the grasp controller on a real robot with 7DoF arm and 7DoF hand.",159
icra,None,Collaborative grasp planning with multiple object representations,"Peter Brook,Matei Ciocarlie,Kaijen Hsiao,","Grasp planning based on perceived sensor data of an object can be performed in different ways, depending on the chosen semantic interpretation of the sensed data. For example, if the object can be recognized and a complete 3D model is available, a different planning tool can be selected compared to the situation in which only the raw sensed data, such as a single point cloud, is available. Instead of choosing between these options, we present a framework that combines them, aiming to find consensus on how the object should be grasped by using the information from each object representation according to their confidence levels. We show that this method is robust to common errors in perception, such as incorrect object recognition, while also taking into account potential grasp execution errors due to imperfect robot calibration. We illustrate this method on the PR2 robot by grasping objects common in human environments.",79
icra,None,The multi-robot coverage problem for optimal coordinated search with an unknown number of robots,"Hyeun Jeong Min,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","This work presents a novel multi-robot coverage scheme for an unknown number of robots; it focuses on optimizing the number of robots and each path cost. Coverage problems traditionally deal with how a given number of robots covers the entire environment. This work, however, presents solutions of not only (i) how to cover the area (locations of interest) within the minimum time, but simultaneously (ii) how to find the optimal number of robots for a given time. Also, we consider the worst but realistic case of all robots starting at the same location instead of assuming randomly initialized positions. The minimum coverage time depends upon the number of robots used. Our research specifies (iii) how to find the minimum coverage time without knowing the number of robots. Finally, we present a deterministic coverage algorithm based on finding the shortest paths in order to optimize the number of robots and corresponding paths.",19
icra,None,Fault-tolerant multiagent robotic formation control exploiting system symmetries,"Bill Goodwine,Panos Antsaklis,","This paper extends some prior work by the authors to address general robustness of solutions in multiagent coordination control problems. In particular, it focuses on fault-tolerant formation control. In our prior work, symmetries in the system were exploited to simplify the nonlinear Lyapunov stability analysis for symmetric systems. The type of symmetry considered is a discrete symmetry where the system is composed of many repeated instances of interacting identical agents. The results are based on Lyapunov methods, and hence are of general applicability and specifically these results are applicable to both distributed as well as non-distributed coordination methods. This paper considers the same types of systems and extends the stability results to the cases of robustness of formation stability under failure of individual agents.",4
icra,None,Coverage control for mobile anisotropic sensor networks,"Bruno Hexsel,Nilanjan Chakraborty,Katia Sycara,","Distributed algorithms for (re)configuring mobile sensors to cover a given area are important for autonomous multi-robot operations in application areas such as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Depending on the assumptions about the choice of the environment, the sensor models, the coverage metric, and the motion models of sensor nodes, there are different versions of the problem that have been formulated and studied. In this paper, we consider a system of holonomic mobile robots equipped with anisotropic sensors (e.g., limited field of view cameras) that are required to cover a polygonal region with polygonal obstacles to detect interesting events. We assume a given probability distribution of the events over a region. Motivated by scenarios where the sensing performance not only depends on the resolution of sensing but also on the relative orientation between the sensing axis and the event, we assume that the probability of detection of an event depends on both sensing parameters and the orientation of observation. We present a distributed gradient-ascent algorithm for reconfiguring the system of mobile robots so that the joint probability of detection of events over the whole region is maximized (i.e., positioning the mobile robots and determining their sensor parameters). As an example case study, we use a system of mobile robots equipped with limited field of view cameras with pan and zoom capabilities. We present simulation results demonstrating the performance of our algorithm.",52
icra,None,Approximate characterization of multi-robot swarm “shapes” in sublinear-time,"Lantao Liu,Benjamin Fine,Dylan Shell,Andreas Klappenecker,","Many envisioned applications of multi-robot swarms involve the detection, production or maintenance of global structures through only local means. This paper introduces a scalable, distributed algorithm to approximately characterize important global geometric and topological properties. For a given spatial arrangement of robots, the algorithm estimates the longest network (geodesic) distance in any direction as well as the average Euclidean distance only using locally sensed information. In so doing, the robots need only to communicate with and sense (range and bearing) nearby robots. The algorithm uses a greedy method to approximate both distance metrics via parallel one-way message traversals. We provide a bound for the number of such traversals, showing a global characterization is produced in a running time that is sublinear in the total number of robots. Along with this analysis, we conduct simulations with hundreds of robots to validate the algorithm.",7
icra,None,Algorithms and design considerations for robot assisted insertion of Perimodiolar Electrode Arrays,"Jason Pile,Mei Yi Cheung,Jian Zhang,Nabil Simaan,","This paper evaluates the potential for using robotic assistance for the insertion of commercial Perimodiolar Electrode Arrays (PEA's) that use a stylet and a pre-curved electrode body.We propose an algorithm for coordinated robotic insertion of the pre-curved electrode body and pulling of the stylet in order to provide partial control over the PEA shape. However, for robotic insertion to be a viable option for PEA's, an understanding of the statistical variability of their characteristics is essential. This paper investigates the kinematics of PEA's, their shape variability, and their expected performance during robotic insertion. An investigation of the required number of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) and the workspace is presented. A study of shape variability is carried out for characterizing shape repeatability across different insertion trials using the same electrode array. Also a study of shape variability is carried out between different electrode arrays. We simulate and evaluate the expected performance of three and four DoF robotic instruments for PEA insertion. The results support our proposed algorithm for coordinated insertion of the electrode array body and pulling of the stylet. They show that existing commerical perimodiolar arrays provide good shape repeatability. These results also point to the need for designing robotic insertion tools with at least four DoF. We believe that these results provide guidelines for future robotic instrument design for cochlear implant PEA's.",17
icra,None,Configuration and joint feedback for enhanced performance of multi-segment continuum robots,"Andrea Bajo,Roger E. Goldman,Nabil Simaan,","Multi-segment continuum robots offer enhanced safety during surgery due to their inherent passive compliance. However, they suffer poor position tracking performance due to flexibility of their actuation lines, structural compliance, and actuation coupling effects between segments. The need for control methods addressing accurate tracking for multi segment continuum robots is magnified by increased precision requirements of surgical procedures employing these structures. To address this need, this paper proposes a tiered controller that uses both extrinsic and intrinsic sensory information for improved performance of multi-segment continuum robots. The higher tier of this controller uses configuration space feedback while the lower tier uses joint space feedback and a feed-forward term obtained with actuation compensation techniques. We prove the stability of this controller using Lyapunov's direct method and experimentally evaluate its performance on a three-segment multi-backbone continuum robot. Results demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing regulation and tracking performance. It is shown that the controller mitigates the effects of actuation coupling between robot's sub-segments and decreases phase lag. These results suggest that this tiered controller will enhance telemanipulation performance of multi-segment continuum robots.",0

The manipulator is designed for surgical applications with a preliminary focus on the removal of osteolysis formed behind the acetabular shell of primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs). The manipulator is constructed from two nested superelastic nitinol tubes enabling lengthwise channels for drive cables. Notches in the nested assembly provide reliable bending under applied cable tension producing kinematics that can be effectively modeled as a series of rigid vertebrae connected using pin joints. The manipulator is controlled in plane with two independently actuated cables in a pull-pull configuration. For the purpose of the procedure, the manipulator is mounted on a Z-θ stage adding a translational and rotational degree of freedom (DOF) along the axis of the manipulator. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the initial modeling and control of the manipulator.",69
icra,None,Computer vision issues in the design of a scrub nurse robot,"Amer Agovic,Joseph Levine,Amrudin Agovic,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","Abstract-A robot scrub nurse (RSN) is an example of a robotic assistant for surgical environments. Ideally, by taking over management of instruments, it would lower costs of an operation and cut down on mistakes. Of vital importance for such robots is how they interface with the environment. A scrub nurse robot requires the ability to sense the human operators before it can assist. Computer vision offers here a number of advantages over other sensing modalities. In this paper we examine a visual tracking system for a robot scrub nurse. The system works by estimating the hand position and orientation of the main surgeon. This information is needed to guide the robot in delivering instruments directly to the surgeon. Our work outlines the entire visual tracking process and evaluates robustness and accuracy. The end result is a re-implementable and working application, suitable for surgical environments, that also offers a degree of operation robustness.",2

The simultaneous intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of central cameras rig, using different models for each camera, is developed. The presented approach is suitable for the calibration of rigs composed by N cameras modelled by N different models.

icra,None,"REIN - A fast, robust, scalable REcognition INfrastructure","Marius Muja,Radu Bogdan Rusu,Gary Bradski,David G. Lowe,","A robust robot perception system intended to enable object manipulation needs to be able to accurately identify objects and their pose at high speeds. Since objects vary considerably in surface properties, rigidity and articulation, no single detector or object estimation method has been shown to provide reliable detection across object types to date. This indicates the need for an architecture that is able to quickly swap detectors, pose estimators, and filters, or to run them in parallel or serial and combine their results, preferably without any code modifications at all. In this paper, we present our implementation of such an infrastructure, ReIn (REcognition INfrastructure), to answer these needs. ReIn is able to combine a multitude of 2D/3D object recognition and pose estimation techniques in parallel as dynamically loadable plugins. It also provides an extremely efficient data passing architecture, and offers the possibility to change the parameters and initial settings of these techniques during their execution. In the course of this work we introduce two new classifiers designed for robot perception needs: BiGGPy (Binarized Gradient Grid Pyramids) for scalable 2D classification and VFH (Viewpoint Feature Histograms) for 3D classification and pose. We then show how these two classifiers can be easily combined using ReIn to solve object recognition and pose identification problems.",78

Standard colour and texture descriptors are extracted on a frame by frame basis to build a representation of appearance, which is probabilistically classified by a novel multi-class generalisation of the Gaussian Process (GP) developed for this work. A GP approach was selected for probabilistic outputs, and the ability to automatically determine the relevance of each input dimension to each of the C classes in the problem. When learning hyperparameters from N training examples, the new formulation scales at O(N ), rather than O(CN3) for the standard one-vs-all approach. The novel classification framework is trained and validated on a set of manual labels, and then queried to visualise a map of vegetation type under the UAV flight path.

icra,None,"Design of a miniature, multi-directional optical flow sensor for Micro Aerial Vehicles","Daniel Watman,Hideaki Murayama,","As Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) become smaller, the correspondingly smaller payload capacity greatly limits the type and number of sensors which can be carried. Biologically inspired visual sensors based on optical flow show great promise due to the small size of the image sensors needed to capture visual data, but the high computational cost is a limiting factor. Current optical flow sensors are either small with very low resolution, or high resolution with large computing requirements, making them unsuitable for the primary sensor for MAVs. This paper presents an optical flow sensor specifically de signed for the needs of MAVs, combining very small size with adequate resolution and the capability of processing many image sensors in a single FPGA. Initial results indicate that per formance is sufficient for MAVs, and optical flow calculations can be performed in real-time with image sensors operating at 320×240 resolution at up to 120 FPS.

A nonlinear balance controller is then designed. We estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of motorcycle dynamics under which the stationary motorcycle can be stabilized by steering. For a typical motorcycle/bicycle configuration, we find that the DOA is relatively small and thus balancing control by only steering at stationary is challenging. The balance control and DOA estimation schemes are validated by experiments conducted on the Rutgers autonomous motorcycle. The attitudes of the motorcycle platform are obtained by a novel estimation scheme that fuses measurements from global positioning systems (GPS) and inertial measurement units (IMU).

In recent literature, an under-actuated open-chain planar manipulator with revolute joints has been shown to be feedback linearizable with specific choices of mass and inertia distribution. It has been shown that the dynamic model of an n-joint manipulator with center of mass located at joint 2 and with only one actuator is static feedback linearizable if and only if the input is at the first or the last joint [1]. In our pursuit for novel designs of under-actuated arms, which are both controllable and feedback linearizable, we investigate the feasibility of designing a 3R planar under-actuated manipulator which has a different distribution of compliance [1]. This study shows that this new architecture of 3R planar under-actuated manipulator with one input at the second joint can still be designed to be differentially flat. With this design, a simple stabilizing controller in the flat output space enables the system to perform point-to-point motion and mitigate initial errors.",1
icra,None,Reciprocal screw-based force-closure of an n-DOF open chain: Minimum number of cables required to fully constrain it,"Shabbir Kurbanhusen Mustafa,Sunil Kumar Agrawal,","Due to the unilateral driving property of cables, it has been mathematically proven that a 6-DOF single rigid-bodied cable-driven platform requires a minimum of 7 cables with positive tension to fully constrain it. However, force-closure analysis of open chains driven by cables is still an open question. For the case of an n-DOF open chain driven by cables, two important questions arise: (i) Are n+1 cables sufficient to fully constrain the entire chain? (ii) How can force-closure analysis be carried out for a given cable routing configuration while retaining the geometric insights of the problem? This paper will address these issues and propose a systematic and novel approach based on the reciprocal screw theory. The analysis shows that the entire n-DOF open chain requires a minimum of n+1 cables to fully constrain it and the proposed methodology can analyze any cable routing configuration.",12
icra,None,Underactuated grasp acquisition and stability using friction based coupling mechanisms,"Joseph T. Belter,Aaron M. Dollar,","Underactuated fingers have been extensively studied and optimized in order to achieve better grasp performance in terms of object acquisition and stability. However, little work has been done related to the coupling mechanisms between the fingers and their effects on grasp performance. This paper presents a novel method of underactuated finger coupling that utilizes friction and allows for increased stability and adaptability of robotic grippers. We show that variable friction within the coupling element can help the system maintain kinematic form closure while not affecting non-closure forces during grasp acquisition. A proof of concept prototype demonstrates the increased stability of objects within the grasp as compared to traditional coupling mechanisms.",5
icra,None,Water column current profile aided localisation combined with view-based SLAM for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle navigation,"Lashika Medagoda,Stefan B. Williams,Oscar Pizarro,Michael V. Jakuba,","Survey class Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) rely on Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) for precise navigation near the seafloor. In cases where the seafloor depth is greater than the DVL bottom lock range, transiting from the surface where GPS is available to the seafloor presents a localisation problem since both GPS and DVL are unavailable in the mid-water column. This is traditionally addressed by using acoustic positioning systems, which take extra time to deploy or require a tracking vessel. Such systems increase the costs of operating in deep waters and reduce the flexibility of AUV operations. This paper proposes an alternative approach to navigation in the mid-water column that exploits the stability of current profiles of water columns over short periods of time. Observation of these currents are possible with the ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) mode of the DVL. Results with real data from missions with the Sirius AUV show how the full integration of water column descent with the ADCP, seafloor view-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping), and ascent to the sea surface with ADCP gives results similar to having continuous bottom lock and shows potential to act as an alternative to acoustic localisation.",16

As MAVs are highly agile, it is not sufficient to directly use the visual input for position control at the framerates that can be achieved with small onboard computers. Our contributions in this work are twofold. First, we present a solution to overcome the issue of having a low frequent onboard visual pose update versus the high agility of an MAV. This is solved by filtering visual information with inputs from inertial sensors. Second, as our system is based on monocular vision, we present a solution to estimate the metric visual scale aid of an air pressure sensor. All computation is running onboard and is tightly integrated on the MAV to avoid jitter and latencies. This framework enables stable flights indoors and outdoors even under windy conditions.",375

icra,None,Incremental construction of the saturated-GVG for multi-hypothesis topological SLAM,"Tong Tao,Stephen Tully,George Kantor,Howie Choset,","The generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) is a topological representation of an environment that can be incrementally constructed with a mobile robot using sensor-based control. However, because of sensor range limitations, the GVG control law will fail when the robot moves into a large open area. This paper discusses an extended GVG approach to topological navigation and mapping: the saturated generalized Voronoi graph (S-GVG), for which the robot employs an additional wall-following behavior to navigate along obstacles at the range limit of the sensor. In this paper, we build upon previous work related to the S-GVG and provide two important contributions: 1) a rigorous discussion of the control laws and algorithm modifications that are necessary for incremental construction of the S-GVG with a mobile robot, and 2) a method for incorporating the S-GVG into a novel multi-hypothesis SLAM algorithm for loop-closing and localization.

icra,None,Fusing optical flow and stereo in a spherical depth panorama using a single-camera folded catadioptric rig,"Igor Labutov,Carlos Jaramillo,Jizhong Xiao,","We present a novel catadioptric-stereo rig consisting of a coaxially-aligned perspective camera and two spherical mirrors with distinct radii in a “folded” configuration. We recover a nearly-spherical dense depth panorama (360°×153°) by fusing depth from optical flow and stereo. We observe that for motion in a horizontal plane, optical flow and stereo generate nearly complementary distributions of depth resolution. While optical flow provides strong depth cues in the periphery and near the poles of the view-sphere, stereo generates reliable depth in a narrow band about the equator. We exploit this principle by modeling the depth resolution of optical flow and stereo in order to fuse them probabilistically in a spherical panorama. To aid the designer in achieving a desired field-of-view and resolution, we derive a linearized model of the rig in terms of three parameters (radii of the two mirrors plus axial separation from their centers). We analyze the error due to the violation of the Single Viewpoint (SVP) constraint and formulate additional constraints on the design to minimize the error. Performance is evaluated through simulation and with a real prototype by computing dense spherical panoramas in cluttered indoor settings.",2

icra,None,Background subtraction and accessibility analysis in evidence grids,"Peter Anderson-Sprecher,Reid Simmons,Daniel Huber,","Evidence grids are a popular representation for fused data from multiple sensors. Previous attempts at back ground subtraction within evidence grids either do so prior to sensor fusion or do so naively, simply ignoring any cells with a high background occupancy probability. A key weakness of these approaches is that they cannot reason about interiors of objects or other unobserved regions. Recognizing and removing solid object interiors is important for any application that must be able to differentiate between occupied and unknown space after background subtraction. In this paper, we propose accessibility analysis as a method for the removal of interior regions. We then present and compare two approaches for performing background subtraction with accessibility analysis in evidence grids. Performance is measured using a 3D evidence grid in a test bed for a sensing system designed for use in safety monitoring of an automated assembly workcell. Within the parameters of the present study, both techniques allow for precise detection of foreground objects while fully removing background objects. Subtraction runs in near real-time, even for large grids.",4
icra,None,Parallax angle parametrization for monocular SLAM,"Liang Zhao,Shoudong Huang,Lei Yan,Gamini Dissanayake,","This paper presents a new unified feature parametrization approach for monocular SLAM. The parametrization is based on the parallax angle and can reliably represent both nearby and distant features, as well as features in the direction of camera motion and features observed only once. A new bundle adjustment (BA) algorithm using the proposed parallax angle parametrization is developed and shown to be more reliable as compared with existing BA algorithms that use Euclidean XYZ or inverse depth parametrizations. A new map joining algorithm that allows combining a sequence of local maps generated using BA with the proposed parametrization, that avoids the large computational cost of a global BA, and can automatically optimize the relative scales of the local maps without any loss of information, is also presented. Extensive simulations and a publicly available large-scale real dataset with centimeter accuracy ground truth are used to demonstrate the accuracy and consistency of the BA and map joining algorithms using the new parametrization. Especially, since the relative scales are optimized automatically in the proposed BA and map joining algorithms, there is no need to compute any relative scales even for a loop more than 1km.",40
icra,None,BoRF: Loop-closure detection with scale invariant visual features,"Hong Zhang,","In this paper, we present a novel method for visual loop-closure detection in autonomous robot navigation. Our method, which we refer to as bag-of-raw-features or BoRF, uses scale-invariant visual features (such as SIFT) directly, rather than their vector-quantized representation or bag-of-words (BoW), which is popular in recent studies of the problem. BoRF avoids the offline process of vocabulary construction, and does not suffer from the perceptual aliasing problem of BoW, thereby significantly improving the recall performance. To reduce the computational cost of direct feature matching, we exploit the fact that images in the case of robot navigation are acquired sequentially, and that feature matching repeatability with respect to scale can be learned and used to reduce the number of the features considered for matching. The proposed method is tested experimentally using indoor visual SLAM image sequences.",91
icra,None,Improved frame-to-frame pose tracking during vision-only SLAM/SFM with a tumbling target,"Sean Augenstein,Stephen M. Rock,","A hybrid algorithm for real-time frame-to-frame pose estimation during monocular vision-only SLAM/SFM is presented. The algorithm combines concepts from two existing approaches to pose tracking, Bayesian estimation methods and measurement inversion techniques, to achieve in real-time a feasible, smooth estimate of the relative pose between a robotic platform and a tumbling target. It is assumed that no a priori information about the target is available, and that only a monocular camera is available for measuring the relative motion of the target with respect to the robotic platform. The rationale for a hybrid approach is explained, and an algorithm is presented. A specific implementation using a modified Rao-Blackwellised particle filter is described and tested. Results from both numerical simulations and field experiments are included which demonstrate the performance and viability of the hybrid approach. The hybrid approach to pose estimation described here is applicable regardless of the method by which the map/reconstruction is estimated.",49
icra,None,MAV visual SLAM with plane constraint,"Gim Hee Lee,Friedrich Fraundorfer,Marc Pollefeys,","Bundle adjustment (BA) which produces highly accurate results for visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) could not be used for Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) with limited processing power because of its O(N 3 ) complexity. We observed that a consistent ground plane often exists for MAVs flying in both the indoor and outdoor urban environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a visual SLAM algorithm that make use of the plane constraint to reduce the complexity of BA. The reduction of complexity is achieved by refining only the current camera pose and most recent map points with BA that minimizes the reprojection errors and perpendicular distances between the most recent map points and the best fit plane with all the pre-existing map points. As a result, our algorithm is approximately constant time since the number of current camera pose and most recent map points remain approximately constant. In addition, the minimization of the perpendicular distances between the plane and map points would enforce consistency between the reconstructed map points and the actual ground plane.",35

Our proposed microfluidic chip has several modules. Each one of them has important functions as (a) loading micro-particles singly to main microfluidic flow by the aid of magnetically driven microtools (MMT); (b) finding particle position in a microfluidic channel by micro-capacitance sensors; (c) adjusting micro-channel height locally by pneumatic pressure valve; (d) dispensing particles out from the microfluidic chip to incubation environment.

As one solution of these problems, we propose ""soft handling probe"" in this paper. The probe has an electrode as a microheater. The thermoresponsive polymer can be gelled when a current is applied to the electrode in the thermoresponsive polymer solution. The electrode was fabricated by cupper wire and sputtering of gold on the probe. Thermal gelation of the thermoresponsive polymer was realized at the fabricated probe tip.

Artificially magnetotactic T. pyriformis cells were created by the internalization of iron oxide nano particles. Following the magnetization of the internalized particles, the cells become controllable using an external time-varying magnetic field. The behavior of artificially magnetotactic T. pyriformis under a magnetic field has been investigated in a manual control experiment. A feasible path planner called rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and a feedback control scheme are implemented to guide the cell to a desired position and orientation. Since the motion of T. pyriformis is nonlinear like that of a car, combining the RRT and feedback control allows the cell to be controlled in 3-dimensional (x, y, ¸) space. In the results, real-time feedback control of T. pyriformis in 3-dimensional space demonstrated the potential of utilizing T. pyriformis as a micro-bio-robot for microscale tasks.",25

Designing robotic systems from this perspective necessitates solving new constrained design challenges that integrate with, adapt, and improve upon known approaches. A new design for a bio-mimetic backdrivable modular robot finger which addresses these challenges is presented. Results are presented demonstrating its effectiveness. The novelty of this robot is not only in the integrative design approach, which meets all the constraints presented without compromise, but also as the first bio-mimetic robot to integrate modularity, and it is highly compact.

In this approach, swarm robots are able to self-organize themselves into complex shapes driven by the dynamics of a gene regulatory network based model. This is a distributed approach, since only local interaction is needed for each robot to make decisions during shape formation without any global controller. The target shape is represented by the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and embedded into the gene regulation model, analogous to the morphogen gradients in morphogenesis. Since the self-organization algorithm does not need a global coordinate system, the target shape can be formed anywhere within the environment based on the current distribution of the robots. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for complex shape construction and robust to environmental changes and system failures.",35
icra,None,A projection method for the elimination of contradicting control forces in redundantly actuated PKM,"Andreas Müller,Timo Hufnagel,","While redundantly actuated PKM (RA-PKM) possess desirable kinematic and dynamic properties, their control is impeded by the occurrence of antagonistic control forces. Such forces are observed in non-linear model-based as well as in decentralized control schemes. In this paper it is outlined that such antagonistic forces are inherent to the decentralized control of RA-PKM, and also that calibration errors and finite encoder resolutions cause antagonistic control forces and excited vibrations, hence energy loss and instabilities. The effect of measurement errors and the stability of individual PD and computed torque control is analyzed. They are shown to yield asymptotically stable setpoint control. A central result of this paper is a projection method for the elimination of contradicting control commands. This method is valid independently of the actual control scheme. Experimental results are presented for a 2RRR/RR implementation. The results confirm that the proposed scheme reduces antagonistic control forces up to measurement errors and model uncertainties.",19

We use manufacturing techniques including printing a mold, pouring a molded part, and deposition of cell suspension. Our method allows for co-fabrication of actuator and mechanism through muscle self-assembly. We incorporate muscle construct technologies such that the muscle is fully 3D, anchored, and aligned, yielding a 10 mm long and 0.5 mm thick aligned muscle actuator. By co-fabricating the mechanism and actuators, the muscles are produced and used in the same environmental conditions, the process is more robust and repeatable, and evaluation of performance is under identical conditions to those in which the actuator is used.

The original iSAM algorithm incrementally maintains the square root information matrix by applying matrix factorization updates. We analyze the matrix updates as simple editing operations on the Bayes tree and the conditional densities represented by its cliques. Based on that insight, we present a new method to incrementally change the variable ordering which has a large effect on efficiency. The efficiency and accuracy of the new method is based on fluid relinearization, the concept of selectively relinearizing variables as needed. This allows us to obtain a fully incremental algorithm without any need for periodic batch steps.

The map contains exhaustive information about both the structure and the appearance of the environment and it is well suited also for large scale environments. We start from the assumption that the surrounding environment (the scene) forms a piecewise smooth surface represented by a triangle mesh. Our system is able to infer, without any odometry information, the structure of the environment along with the ego-motion of the camera by performing a robust tracking of the projection of this surface in the omnidirectional image. The key idea is to use a guess of the triangle mesh subdivision based on a constrained Delaunay triangulation built according to a set of point features and edgelet features extracted from the image. In such a way, we take into account both the corners and the edges of the scene imaged by the camera, constrained by the topology of the triangulation in order to improve the stability of the tracking process. Both motion and structure parameters are estimated using a direct method inside an optimization framework, taking into account the topology of the subdivision in a robust and efficient way.

Deploying such a system using current text recognition systems, however, is difficult since even state-of-the-art systems have difficulty reading text from non-document images. Despite these difficulties we present a series of additions to the typical mapping pipeline that nevertheless allow us to create highly usable results. In fact, we show how our text detection and recognition system, combined with several other ingredients, allows us to generate an annotated map that enables our robot to recognize named locations specified by a user in 84% of cases.",59

The measurement method is based on a static identification method and intrinsic impedance is identified inbetween 25 ms. Using this device it is possbile to develop continuous grasp impedance measurement methods as it is an active research topic in physiology as well as in robotics, especially since nowadays (bio-inspired) robotics can be impedance-controlled.

icra,None,Influence of contact types and uncertainties in the computation of Independent Contact Regions,"Máximo A. Roa,Raúl Suárez,","Independent Contact Regions provide robustness in front of finger positioning errors during an object grasping. However, different sources of uncertainty may be present like, for instance, the friction model used in grasp planning, indetermination of the friction coefficients, and errors in the model of the object that affect the positions of the boundary points as well as the direction normal to the object surface. These sources have not been previously considered in the computation of the Independent Contact Regions. This paper discusses how to take into account these factors when computing the Independent Contact Regions for discretized objects, i.e. objects described with a cloud or a mesh of points. The considerations provided allow a more robust result for application in grasp synthesis and regrasp planning.",14
icra,None,Systematic touch scheme for a humanoid robot to grasp a door knob,"Hitoshi Arisumi,Nosan Kwak,Kazuhito Yokoi,","This paper deals with the practical problem as to how a humanoid robot opens a door in an office environment. Among the several tasks for the door opening, we focus on the recognition of a door and grasping its knob and propose a systematic touch scheme that combines the visual and touch data to grasp a knob safely and robustly. The visual recognition of a door and its knob is done by feature matching by a feature classifier and a segmentation method with minor assumptions about a knob, respectively. The position of a knob from the visual recognition is refined by the proposed touch scheme where a robot touches a knob several times with a hand equipped with a force-torque sensor. We realize that in the on-line experiment, a robot recognizes a door and its knob, and grasps the knob and partially opens the door.",9
icra,None,Towards an automatic robot regrasping movement based on human demonstration using tangle topology,"Phongtharin Vinayavekhin,Shunsuke Kudoh,Katsushi Ikeuchi,","This paper introduces a novel method to teach a robot to regrasp an object based on the Programming by Demonstration paradigm. In this paradigm, a robot observes a human performing a regrasping task via various sensors to recognise crucial information in order to reproduce the task using its own hand. The main contribution is in the proposal of a representation technique that can analyse a human regrasping movement and reproduce this movement in a robot hand. The technique is based on tangle topology where both hand and manipulated object are considered as strands. This allows a regrasping movement to be considered as an alteration of the tangle relationship between the strands (hand and the object) over time. Human regrasping movements are analysed and reproduced in multi-fingered robot hands in a grasp simulation to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",20
icra,None,A master-slave fluid cooperative control algorithm for optimal trajectory planning,"Doug Lipinski,Kamran Mohseni,","A control algorithm based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is used to guide a simulated swarm of unmanned vehicles along a pre-computed optimal trajectory. By using a fluid based control method, collision avoidance is automatically incorporated into the control. Given an initial position and goal location, it is computationally impractical to compute the optimal trajectories for a large swarm of vehicles. To overcome this, the optimal trajectory is computed for a single vehicle and the swarm is guided along this trajectory using fluid based control, in this case SPH. Importantly, this method avoids computing a potential field to guide the swarm and is easily adaptable to changing environments. Additionally, this method is intended to be used in the presence of a background flow through which the vehicles must travel. This control algorithm is found to be quite robust in the test case examined here and adding additional vehicles to the swarm has only a small impact on fuel consumption per vehicle.",22
icra,None,Continuum model of crossing pedestrian flows and swarm control based on temporal/spatial frequency,"Ko Yamamoto,Masafumi Okada,","In the densely-populated urban areas, pedestrian flows often cross each other and congestion occurs. It may cause discomfort feeling or pedestrian accidents. In order to reduce the congestion or the risk of accidents, it is required to control swarm flows of pedestrian. This paper proposes an implicit control method of the crossing pedestrian flows. Pedestrian flow is modeled with the continuum fluid model and its congestion degree is calculated as the fluid density. From a simulation of the crossing flows with the continuum model, it is verified that diagonal stripe pattern of the congestion degree emerges. Moreover, the authors propose an implicit control method to improve average flow velocity by moving guides. Focusing on periodic phenomenon of the crossing flows, we investigate the relationship between its temporal and spatial frequency and a periodic motion of guides. From this relationship, a control method based on the temporal and spatial frequency is proposed.",22

A general architecture for decentralized supervisory control of Fuzzy Discrete Event Systems (FDES), which is capable of modeling asynchronous event driven systems with inherited uncertainties, is developed. This architecture is then incorporated for con trolling behavior-based mobile robots moving in unstructured environments while maintaining a fixed distance between each other, which resembles a tightly-coupled multi robot object manipulation task. The proposed approach is then successfully implemented in simulation with two mobile robots and a performance evaluation is also performed to investigate the validity of the proposed approach over the centralized and crisp Discrete Event System (DES) based approaches.",2
icra,None,Robust control of horizontal formation dynamics for autonomous underwater vehicles,"Huizhen Yang,Fumin Zhang,","This paper presents a novel robust controller design for formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We consider a nonlinear three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the horizontal motion of each AUV. By using the Jacobi transform, the horizontal dynamics of AUVs are explicitly expressed as dynamics for formation shape and formation center, and are further decoupled by feedback control. We treat the coupling terms as perturbations to the decoupled system. An H ∞ . state feedback controller is designed to achieve robust stability of the closed loop formation and translation dynamics. By incorporating an orientation controller, the formation shape under control converges and the formation center tracks a desired trajectory simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controllers.",12

The Tracking Fluoroscope System (TFS) is intended to be an orthopedic diagnostic tool that provides more accurate and detailed in vivo pre-operative and post-operative information for surgeons. This is accomplished through the ability to fluoroscope natural and uninterrupted human joint motion during level walking, step climbing, and ramp walking. This overall functionality requires independent tracking of the position and orientation of the body with respect to the robotic platform, as well as the position of the joints with respect to the body. The overall robotic system, embodied in the TFS, necessary to accurately perform real-time imaging of joints in motion is discussed. Recent subject and joint tracking experimental results are presented.",2
icra,None,Evaluation of telerobotic shared control for efficient manipulation of single-cells in microinjection,"Jungsik Kim,Dongjune Chang,Hamid Ladjal,David Folio,Antoine Ferreira,,","Microinjection is the highly efficient delivery method of exogenous materials into cells, and it has been widely used in biomedical research areas such as transgenics and genomics. However, this direct injection task is time consuming and laborious, resulting in low throughput and poor reproducibility. This paper describes a telerobotic shared control (TSC) framework for the microinjection with high manipulation efficiencies, in which a micromanipulator is controlled by the shared motion commands of both the human operator (direct manipulation) and the autonomous controller. To determine the optimal gains between the operator and the controller, we proposed a quantitative evaluation method using Fitts' and steering laws. The results showed that a 40%-60% weighting on the human operator produced better performance for both speed and accuracy of task completion, and suggested that some level of automation or human involvement is important for microinjection tasks.",6

icra,None,Maximizing dexterous workspace and optimal port placement of a multi-arm surgical robot,"Zhi Li,Daniel Glozman,Dejan Milutinovic,Jacob Rosen,","Surgical procedures are traditionally performed by two or more surgeons along with staff nurses. One surgeon serves as the primary surgeon and the other serves as his/her assistant. Surgical robotics have redefined the dynamics in which the two surgeons interact with each other and with the surgical site. Raven IV is a new generation of the surgical robot system having four articulated robotic arms in a spherical configuration, each holding an articulated surgical tool. The system allows two surgeons to teleoperate the Raven IV collaboratively from two remote sites. The current research effort aims to configure the link architecture of each robotic arm, along with the position (port placement) and orientation of the Raven IV with respect to the patient, in order to optimize the common workspace reachable by all four robotic arms. The simulation results indicate that tilting the base of the robotic arms in the range of -20 to 20 deg while moving the ports closer together up to 50 mm apart leads to a preferred circular shape of the common workspace with an isotropy value of 0.5. A carefully configured system with multiple surgical robotic arms will enhance the interactive performance of the two surgeons.",29
icra,None,3D modelling of leaves from color and ToF data for robotized plant measuring,"G. Alenyà,B. Dellen,C. Torras,","Supervision of long-lasting extensive botanic experiments is a promising robotic application that some recent technological advances have made feasible. Plant modelling for this application has strong demands, particularly in what concerns 3D information gathering and speed. This paper shows that Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras achieve a good compromise between both demands, providing a suitable complement to color vision. A new method is proposed to segment plant images into their composite surface patches by combining hierarchical color segmentation with quadratic surface fitting using ToF depth data. Experimentation shows that the interpolated depth maps derived from the obtained surfaces fit well the original scenes. Moreover, candidate leaves to be approached by a measuring instrument are ranked, and then robot-mounted cameras move closer to them to validate their suitability to being sampled. Some ambiguities arising from leaves overlap or occlusions are cleared up in this way. The work is a proof-of-concept that dense color data combined with sparse depth as provided by a ToF camera yields a good enough 3D approximation for automated plant measuring at the high throughput imposed by the application.",116
icra,None,“Bring it to me” - generation of behavior-relevant scene elements for interactive robot scenarios,"Nils Einecke,Manuel Mühlig,Jens Schmüdderich,Michael Gienger,","Humanoid robots are intended to act and interact in dynamically changing environments in the presence of humans. Current robotic systems are usually able to move in dynamically changing environments because of an inbuilt depth and obstacle sensing. However, for acting in their environment the internal representation of such systems is usually constructed by hand and known in advance. In contrast, this paper presents a system that dynamically constructs its internal scene representation using a model-based vision approach. This enables our system to approach and grasp objects in an previously unknown scene. We combine standard stereo with model-based image fitting techniques for a real-time estimation of the position and orientation of objects. The model-based image processing allows for an easy transfer to the internal, dynamic scene representation. For movement generation we use a task-level whole-body control approach that is coupled with a movement optimization scheme. Furthermore, we present a novel method that constrains the robot to keep certain objects in the FOV while moving. We demonstrate the successful interplay between model-based vision, dynamic scene representation, and movement generation by means of some interactive reaching and grasping tasks.",3
icra,None,"Fast and bottom-up object detection, segmentation, and evaluation using Gestalt principles","Gert Kootstra,Danica Kragic,","In many scenarios, domestic robot will regularly encounter unknown objects. In such cases, top-down knowledge about the object for detection, recognition, and classification cannot be used. To learn about the object, or to be able to grasp it, bottom-up object segmentation is an important competence for the robot. Also when there is top-down knowledge, prior segmentation of the object can improve recognition and classification. In this paper, we focus on the problem of bottom-up detection and segmentation of unknown objects. Gestalt psychology studies the same phenomenon in human vision. We propose the utilization of a number of Gestalt principles. Our method starts by generating a set of hypotheses about the location of objects using symmetry. These hypotheses are then used to initialize the segmentation process. The main focus of the paper is on the evaluation of the resulting object segments using Gestalt principles to select segments with high figural goodness. The results show that the Gestalt principles can be successfully used for detection and segmentation of unknown objects. The results furthermore indicate that the Gestalt measures for the goodness of a segment correspond well with the objective quality of the segment. We exploit this to improve the overall segmentation performance.",31

icra,None,Detection and avoidance of semi-transparent obstacles using a collective-reward based approach,"Varun Raj Kompella,Peter Sturm,","Most of the computer and robot-vision algorithms are designed mainly for opaque objects and non-opaque objects have received less attention, in spite of them being omnipresent in man-made environments. With an increasing usage of such objects, especially those made of glass, plastic etc., it becomes necessarily important to detect this class of objects while building a robot navigation system. Obstacle avoidance forms a primary yet challenging task in mobile robot navigation. The main objective of this paper is to present an algorithm to detect and avoid obstacles that are made of semi-transparent materials, such as plastic or glass. The algorithm makes use of a technique called the collective-reward based approach to detect such objects from single images captured by an uncalibrated camera in a live video stream. Random selection techniques are incorporated in the method to make the algorithm run in real-time. A mobile robot then uses the information after detection to perform an obstacle avoidance maneuver.

icra,None,Reciprocal collision avoidance with acceleration-velocity obstacles,"Jur van den Berg,Jamie Snape,Stephen J.

We discuss both the case of navigating a single robot among moving obstacles, and the case of multiple robots reciprocally avoiding collisions with each other while navigating a common workspace. Inspired by the concept of velocity obstacles [3], we introduce the acceleration-velocity obstacle (AVO) to let a robot avoid collisions with moving obstacles while obeying acceleration constraints. AVO characterizes the set of new velocities the robot can safely reach and adopt using proportional control of the acceleration. We extend this concept to reciprocal collision avoidance for multi-robot settings, by letting each robot take half of the responsibility of avoiding pairwise collisions. Our formulation guarantees collision-free navigation even as the robots act independently and simultaneously, without coordination. Our approach is designed for holonomic robots, but can also be applied to kinematically constrained non-holonomic robots such as cars. We have implemented our approach, and we show simulation results in challenging environments with large numbers of robots and obstacles.",244

While prior work in underactuated robotic hands has primarily focused on the mechanism's ability to curl its distal degrees of freedom inward even after the proximal degrees of freedom are constrained by contact with the environment, this paper explores the mechanism's adaptability in terms of both motion and force-application capabilities in the presence of external constraints. Specifically, using four different transmissions for a novel singly-actuated linear three degree-of-freedom mechanism, this paper analyzes how the system's ability to reconfigure joints and apply new contact forces varies as a function of the transmission configuration and object geometry. We show that with more extensive re routing of a single actuator to multiple joints, the mechanism exhibits greater motion and force adaptability at the cost of decreased maximum joint travel and contact forces.",13

Dollar,","The compliance of an underactuated robotic hand, or a robotic hand with fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, is a function of the mechanism type, the design parameters, and the operational control mode. The transmissions used in underactuated mechanisms can be divided into two main classes based on the self adaptive transmission used to route actuation to the various degrees of freedom, namely the single-acting transmission and the double-acting transmission. While both transmission classes can be represented using a kinematic constraint equation that defines the relationship between actuator and joint motion, the main difference between the two transmission classes is that the kinematic constraint is always active in double-acting mechanisms while there are specific combinations of external disturbances and mechanism parmeters that render the constraint inactive in single-acting mechanisms. While previous studies have only explored the performance of underactuated mechanisms with the constraint always active, this paper identifies the benefits for robotic grasping (such as better disturbance rejection) that arise when the constraint becomes inactive in single-acting mechanisms.",7

Much of this work has focused on the manipulation of phrasing, articulation and rubato to make music more expressive. However, it has been difficult to study neuromuscular control used by experts to create such musical music. This paper took a first step toward this effort by using the Anatomically Correct Testbed (ACT) Robotic Hand to mimic the way expert humans play when they are instructed to perform ""musically"" or ""robotically."" Results from 22 human subjects showed that musical expression contained a larger range of dynamics and different articulation than robotic expression, while there was no difference in the use of rubato. The ACT Hand was controlled to the level of precision that allowed the replication of expert expressive performance. Its performance was then rated by 17 human listeners against music played by a human expert to show that the ACT Hand could play as musically as an expert human. Furthermore, articulation, phrasing, and rubato were tested in isolation to determine the importance of articulation over phrasing and rubato. This type of study will lead to understanding how to implement future robots to perform musically without pre-programming them, finding ways to teach novice pianists strategies in controlling their muscles to become expressive musicians more quickly, and understanding why humans feel expressiveness or even emotion in music.",31

Since interest points describe only local portions of objects and scenes, they offer robustness to clutter, occlusions, and intra-class variation. In this paper, we present an efficient approximate algorithm to extract surface normal interest points (SNIPs) in corners and blob-like surface regions from depth images. The interest points are detected on characteristic scales that indicate their spatial extent. Our method is able to cope with irregularly sampled, noisy measurements which are typical to depth imaging devices. It also offers a trade-off between computational speed and accuracy which allows our approach to be applicable in a wide range of problem sets.

However, in a real environment, there exist many kinds of moving objects other than people, and previous methods have focused only on humans. To design a more sophisticated system, it is necessary to distinguish humans from observed objects and recognize their individual condition-for example, the kind and amount of belongings they are carrying. However, in previous methods using 2D laser range finders (LRFs), it proved difficult to recognize the type of target since all sensors observe a common horizontal plane and only the 2D contours of their targets. In this study, to recognize the type of target, we observe the 3D shapes of objects moving in their environment by installing LRFs with an angle of inclination. So far, in the area of 3D modeling, LRFs have been used to construct 3D models of static objects by moving the sensor and registering multiple views. In contrast, our method observes moving objects by using a static LRF network in the environment. Experimental results are shown to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",9

The distribution is evaluated using a Rao Blackwellised particle filter, which weights particles based on local appearance and odometric similarity and explicitly models both the likelihood of revisiting previous locations and visiting new locations. A modified resampling scheme counters particle deprivation and allows loop closure updates to be performed in constant time regardless of map size.

New technology for manufacturing processes plays a significant role in this process. Achieving the potential of technological innovations in production, however, requires a wide range of management, as well as engineering issues related to the system. Material handling is a key component in reaching flexibility, manufacturing, dynamism and agility goals. The handling capacity of advanced materials is essential because without this ability of providing the material needed for the proper workstation at the right time and in the right amount, the whole plant will become ""bogged down"".

It proposes a visual attention-oriented speech-based human robot interaction framework which helps a robot to switch back and-forth between the two modes of visual attention. A set of experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework.,4

In this work, we present a Reinforcement Learning based approach to acquiring new motor skills from demonstration. Our approach allows the robot to learn fine manipulation skills and significantly improve its success rate and skill level starting from a possibly coarse demonstration. Our approach aims to incorporate task domain knowledge, where appropriate, by working in a space consistent with the constraints of a specific task. In addition, we also present an approach to using sensor feedback to learn a predictive model of the task outcome. This allows our system to learn the proprioceptive sensor feedback needed to monitor subsequent executions of the task online and abort execution in the event of predicted failure. We illustrate our approach using two example tasks executed with the PR2 dual-arm robot: a straight and accurate pool stroke and a box flipping task using two chopsticks as tools.",228

K. Leung,Timothy D. Barfoot,Hugh H. T. Liu,","This paper presents a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that allows a recursive state estimation process to be both distributed and decentralized in a sparse robot network that is never guaranteed to be fully connected (communication-wise). In such a sparse network, a robot may not always have the latest odometry and measurements from other robots. Our approach allows robots to obtain a temporary (localization and map) estimate at the current timestep using information available locally, but we also ensure that the centralized-equivalent estimate can always be recovered by all robots at a later time; we do not require a robot to keep track of what other robots know when it applies the Markov property to discard past information. Our method is validated through a hardware SLAM experiment where we distribute data association hypotheses amongst a team of robots. Estimate errors are shown to validate the performance of our approach. We also discuss the trade-offs and show comparisons between our distributed approach versus a non-distributed one.",35

Each tracker is equipped with short range communication hardware and a low resolution sensor that can detect the presence of targets, but not their precise locations, their identities, nor even the number of targets within the sensing range. We present methods for set-membership-based filtering that exploit specific structures in the information space for this problem. We also describe an active algorithm that allows the tracker team to follow the targets in a coordinated way, in spite of the incomplete information and intermittent communication links. A simulation of this algorithm shows that the passive filtering algorithm maintains an accurate representation of each tracker's knowledge, and that the active tracking algorithm is able to leverage this information to achieve accurate, robust target tracking.",7

A proportional controller is used to maintain robots in a formation based on estimates of the robots' states observed through the network. The state information is propagated through the network using a flooding algorithm, which introduces topology-dependent time delays. The coupled interaction of information flow over the network with the dynamics of the robots is modeled as a linear dynamical system. With this model it is shown that systems made up of robots with stable first order dynamics are stable for all network update times, positive feedback gains, and connected communication graphs. With higher order robot dynamics it is found that stability is a complex and counter intuitive function of feedback gain and network update time. A performance metric is proposed for analyzing the convergence rate of the multi-robot system. Experiments with flying quadrotor robots verify the predictions of the model and the performance metric.",35

From a single video sequence with multiple moving objects and stationary background, our algorithm combines spatial (color distribution) and temporal (variety between two consecutive frames) information to extract foreground objects accurately and efficiently. The key idea of our method is to employ tracking results as feedback cues for target detection in the next frame, which adaptively updates the weights and threshold.

Ang,Aun Neow Poo,","We investigate in this paper the problem of misalignment-robust facial expression recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been formally addressed in the literature. Most existing facial expression recognition methods, however, can only work well when face images are well-aligned. In many real world applications such as human robot interaction and visual surveillance, it is still very challenging to obtain well-aligned face images for expression recognition due to currently imperfect vision techniques, especially under uncontrolled conditions. Motivated by the fact that interclass facial images with small differences are more easily mis-classified than those with large differences, we propose a biased linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) method by imposing large penalties on interclass samples with small differences and small penalties on those samples with large differences simultaneously, such that more discriminative features can be extracted for recognition. Moreover, we generate more virtually misaligned facial expression samples and assign different weights to them according to their occurrence probabilities in the testing phase to learn a weighted BLDA (WBLDA) feature space to extract misalignment-robust discriminative features for recognition. Experimental results on two widely used face databases are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed method.",1
icra,None,“Wii Using Only ‘We’”: Using background subtraction and human pose recognition to eliminate game controllers,"Yuanqiang Dong,Daniel Conrad,G. N. DeSouza,","We propose a novel human-computer interface for video gaming systems. Unlike current systems that use active sensors (e.g. Kinect), in the proposed approach, the human-poses are captured by a single camera and used to control the course of the game. This eliminates the need for traditional hand-held controllers and allows for the player to be immersed into the virtual environment of the game. The success of the approach is achieve through a robust extraction of human silhouettes and by a simple but effective human-pose recognizer. The system employs an adaptive framework for background subtraction using Adaptive Local Principal Component Analysis (ALPCA), which is able to handle sudden as well as gradual changes in background. Next, the extracted human silhouettes are used to train a appearance-based algorithm that can recognize the human poses. The excellent results reported here justify the elimination of active sensors and game controllers for many traditional games.",4
icra,None,Bringing clothing into desired configurations with limited perception,"Marco Cusumano-Towner,Arjun Singh,Stephen Miller,James F. O'Brien,,","We consider the problem of autonomously bringing an article of clothing into a desired configuration using a general-purpose two-armed robot. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) for estimating the identity of the article and tracking the article's configuration throughout a specific sequence of manipulations and observations. At the end of this sequence, the article's configuration is known, though not necessarily desired. The estimated identity and configuration of the article are then used to plan a second sequence of manipulations that brings the article into the desired configuration. We propose a relaxation of a strain limiting finite element model for cloth simulation that can be solved via convex optimization; this serves as the basis of the transition and observation models of the HMM. The observation model uses simple perceptual cues consisting of the height of the article when held by a single gripper and the silhouette of the article when held by two grippers. The model accurately estimates the identity and configuration of clothing articles, enabling our procedure to autonomously bring a variety of articles into desired configurations that are useful for other tasks, such as folding.",151

Based on optimal control theory and operational space control, our method can generate an infinite number of variations in real-time that resemble the kinematic and dynamic characteristics from the single input motion sequence. We also introduce a stochastic method to generate smooth but nondeterministic transitions between arbitrary motion variants. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluate task-aware variance against random white torque noise, operational space control, style-based inverse kinematics, and retargeted human motion to prove that task-aware variance generates human-like motion. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of task-aware variance to maintain velocity and time-dependent features that exist in the input motion.",5

A hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approach is used to provide the robot with the ability to: (i) learn appropriate assistive behaviors based on the structure of the activity and (ii) personalize the interaction based on the person's affective state during the activity.

In addition, traditional programming methods for industrial robots is too complex for an inexperienced robot programmer, thus external assistance is often needed. In this paper a new incremental multimodal language, which uses augmented reality (AR) environment, is presented. The proposed language architecture makes it possible to manipulate, pick or place the objects in the scene. This approach shifts the focus of industrial robot programming from coordinate based programming paradigm, to object based programming scheme.

Firstly, the mathematical definition of the position/orientation resolution is given. Then we discuss how to calculate them using Rayleigh quotient. And the design optimization problem is formulated. Fundamental concepts of the method are illustrated through a 3-RRR planar parallel manipulator. The design process to achieve an optimized task space of the required pose resolution is also demonstrated in the example.",2
icra,None,General formulation of the singularity locus for a 3-dof regional manipulator,"Peter Donelan,Andreas Müller,","The analysis of singularities is a central aspect in the design of robotic manipulators. Such analyses are usually based on the use of geometric parameters like DH parameters. However, the manipulator kinematics is naturally described using the concept of screws and twists, associated to Lie groups and algebras. These give rise to general and coordinate-invariant singularity conditions on the manipulator geometry. In this setting no restrictions are imposed onto the type of joints, as it is the case when using DH parameters. In this paper a single closed-form equation is presented that gives a complete description of the singularity locus of an arbitrary regional manipulator in terms of two joint variables and all design parameters, expressed by joint screw coordinates, together with the coordinates for the wrist centre. Some examples are reported, and it is shown that the expression can be used to analyse bifurcations in the singularity locus. The simple form of the condition should make it useful for practical design as well as for a deeper understanding of singularities.",1

This research approach aims in understanding the human motor control from an engineering point of view and enabling the communication between humans and robots in musical terms. In a previous research, we have presented the Waseda Saxophonist Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which improved the design of the lip and finger mechanisms. In addition, a feed-forward air pressure with dead-time compensation and an overblowing correction controller were implemented. However, the range of pressure was too limited to reproduce dynamic effects of the sound (i.e. decrescendo, etc.), a delay on the response of the finger mechanism was detected (due to the use of a wire-driven mechanism) and deviations on the pitch during the saxophone playing were observed. Therefore; in this paper, we present the Waseda Saxophonist Robot No. 2 Refined (WAS-2R). In particular the shape of the oral cavity has been re-designed to increase the sound pressure range and potentiometers were embedded on the fingers to reduce the dynamic delay response of the wire-driven mechanism. In addition, a Pressure-Pitch Controller has been implemented to reduce the deviation of the sound pitch by implementing a feedback error learning algorithm for a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output system. A set of experiments were proposed to verify the effectiveness of the re-designed mechanisms and the improved control strategy. From the experimental results, we could confirm the improvements to extend the sound pressure range to reproduce the decrescendo effect, to reduce the response delay from the finger mechanism as well as the deviations on the sound pitch.",3
icra,None,Humanoid navigation with dynamic footstep plans,"Johannes Garimort,Armin Hornung,Maren Bennewitz,","Humanoid robots possess the capability of step ping over or onto objects, which distinguishes them from wheeled robots. When planning paths for humanoids, one therefore should consider an intelligent placement of footsteps instead of choosing detours around obstacles. In this paper, we present an approach to optimal footstep planning for humanoid robots. Since changes in the environment may appear and a humanoid may deviate from its originally planned path due to imprecise motion execution or slippage on the ground, the robot might be forced to dynamically revise its plans. Thus, efficient methods for planning and replanning are needed to quickly adapt the footstep paths to new situations. We formulate the problem of footstep planning so that it can be solved with the incremental heuristic search method D* Lite and present our extensions, including continuous footstep locations and efficient collision checking for footsteps. In experiments in simulation and with a real Nao humanoid, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the footstep plans computed and revised by our method. Additionally, we evaluate different footstep sets and heuristics to identify the ones leading to the best performance in terms of path quality and planning time. Our D* Lite algorithm for footstep planning is available as open source implementation.",76

Several controllers from the Computed Torque (CT) family together with a Passivity Based controller (PBC) are compared based on their energy efficiency and robustness. The previous controllers are used in their original form, with minor adjustment to handle hybrid systems such as the kneed biped case. PBC proved not suitable for real implementation however a combined strategy between PBC and a soft PD control has shown promising results. PD Computed Torque control also offered high tolerance to disturbances with reasonable energy consumption.

icra,None,The optimal swing-leg retraction rate for running,"J.G. Daniël Karssen,Matt Haberland,Martijn Wisse,Sangbae Kim,","Swing-leg retraction was introduced as a way to improve the stability and disturbance rejection of running robots. It was also suggested that the reduced foot speed due to swing-leg retraction can help reduce impact energy losses, decrease peak forces, and minimize foot slipping. However, the extent to which swing-leg retraction rate influences all these benefits was unknown. In this paper, we present a study on the effect of swing-leg retraction rate on these benefits. The results of this study show that swing-leg retraction can indeed improve the performance of running robots in all of the suggested areas. However, the results also show that, for moderate and high running speeds, the optimal retraction rate for maximal disturbance rejection and stability is different from the optimal retraction rate for minimal impact losses, peak forces, and foot slipping. This discrepancy indicates an inherent tradeoff to consider when selecting the retraction rate for a robot control system: in general, retraction rate can be optimized for better stability and disturbance rejection or for more favorable efficiency, impact forces, and footing stability, but not all simultaneously. Furthermore, this tradeoff becomes more severe as running speed increases.",58
icra,None,Speed independent terrain classification using Singular Value Decomposition Interpolation,"Eric Coyle,Emmanuel G. Collins,Rodney G. Roberts,","Terrain classification is key to using terrain dependent control modes to improve performance of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). One of the most viable forms of terrain classification, reaction-based terrain classification, is subject to the problem of speed and load dependency, which requires collecting large data sets for algorithm training. The research presented here presents a method of interpolating point clouds called Singular Value Decomposition Interpolation or SVDI, which uses singular value decomposition, matrix logarithms and Catmull-Rom splines. The estimated point clouds can then substitute for empirical training data, thereby reducing the need to collect large data sets for algorithm training. Here, SVDI is applied to the problem of speed dependency using a mobile robot. Although it is seen that interpolated point clouds are not as effective as real data, interpolated point clouds are seen to be more effective than known point clouds that do not correspond to the desired vehicle speed. Therefore it is concluded that SVDI can effectively reduce the speed and load dependence of reaction-based terrain classification.",24

The dynamics features are composed of torques from knee and hip joints of both legs and implicitly include the gravity, ground reaction forces, and the pose of the remaining body parts. These features are more discriminative than the kinematics features, and they result in a low dimensional representation of a human action which preserves much information of the original high dimensional pose. This low dimensional feature allows us to achieve a good classification performance even with a relatively small training data in a simple classification framework such as HMM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on the CMU motion capture dataset with various actions.",9
icra,None,Fast object detection for robots in a cluttered indoor environment using integral 3D feature table,"Asako Kanezaki,Takahiro Suzuki,Tatsuya Harada,Yasuo Kuniyoshi,","Realizing automatic object search by robots in an indoor environment is one of the most important and challenging topics in mobile robot research. If the target object does not exist in a nearby area, the obvious strategy is to go to the area in which it was last observed. We have developed a robot system that collects 3D-scene data in an indoor environment during automatic routine crawling, and also detects objects quickly through a global search of the collected 3D-scene data. The 3D-scene data can be obtained automatically by transforming color images and range images into a set of color voxel data using self-location information. To detect an object, the system moves the bounding box of the target object by a certain step in the color voxel data, extracts 3D features in each box region, and computes the similarity between these features and the target object's features, using an appropriate feature projection learned beforehand. Taking advantage of the additive property of our 3D features, both feature extraction and similarity calculation are considerably accelerated. In the object learning process, the system obtains the feature-projection matrix by weighting unique features of the target object rather than its common features, resulting in reducing object detection errors.",34

Our new track classification method, based on a mathematically principled method of combining log odds estimators, is fast enough for real time use, is non-specific to object class, and performs well (98.5% accuracy) on the task of classifying correctly-tracked, well-segmented objects into car, pedestrian, bicyclist, and background classes. We evaluate the classifier's performance using the Stanford Track Collection, a new dataset of about 1.3 million labeled point clouds in about 14,000 tracks recorded from an autonomous vehicle research platform.

icra,None,Robust EKF-SLAM method against disturbance using the Shifted Mean based Covariance Inflation Technique,"Won-Seok Choi,Se-Young Oh,","This paper presents a novel solution to overcome the disturbance noise (outlier) for the Extended Kalman Filter based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (EKF-SLAM). The standard Kalman Filter (KF) is not robust to the disturbance noise. The possibility that disturbance may happen is high, because SLAM aims at exploring unknown environment. Hence KF based SLAM methods should consider how to handle the disturbance noise. Variations of KF have been introduced to overcome this problem. However, these methods employ manual parameter tuning, detecting/weighting method. The core of our algorithm is to inflate the state uncertainty by using the magnitude of innovation, without tuning and detecting. Although it is impossible to estimate the state value immediately, the inflated state uncertainty makes it possible for the estimated value to converge on the true value much faster. We evaluate the proposed method under the well-known benchmark Matlab program. The results show that the proposed method overcomes the disturbance noise and increases the performance of EKF-SLAM.",13

While the feasibility of monocular SLAM has been demonstrated and undelayed initialization has been achieved using the inverse depth parametrization, it is still challenging to achieve undelayed initialization in monocular SLAM with GO because of the delay decision of static and moving object classification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective static and moving object classification method using the velocity estimates directly from SLAM with GO. Compared to the existing approach in which the observations of a new/unclassified feature can not be used in state estimation, the proposed approach makes the uses of all observations without any delay to estimate the whole state vector of SLAM with GO. Both Monte Carlo simulations and real experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed classification algorithm and the estimates of monocular SLAM with GO.",15
icra,None,Incremental topo-metric SLAM using vision and robot odometry,"Stéphane Bazeille,David Filliat,","We address the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping by combining visual loop-closure detection with metrical information given by the robot odometry. The proposed algorithm builds in real-time topo-metric maps of an unknown environment, with a monocular or omnidirectional camera and odometry gathered by motors encoders. A dedicated improved version of our previous work on purely appearance-based loop-closure detection [1] is used to extract potential loop-closure locations. Potential locations are then verified and classified using a new validation stage. The main contributions we bring are the generalization of the validation method for the use of monocular and omnidirectional camera with the removal of the camera calibration stage, the inclusion of an odometry-based evolution model in the Bayesian filter which improves accuracy and responsiveness, and the addition of a consistent metric position estimation. This new SLAM method does not require any calibration or learning stage (i.e. no a priori information about environment). It is therefore fully incremental and generates maps usable for global localization and planned navigation. This algorithm is moreover well suited for remote processing and can be used on toy robots with very small computational power.",34

In a novel approach to spatial representation quality measurement, the 3D geometrical modeling task is formulated as a classification problem and its accuracy is evaluated with standard machine learning performance metrics.

The arbitrary shape objects are made of the photo-crosslinkable resin on the microfluidic device under a microscope and these objects are manipulated by optical tweezers. In this paper, we report a method of hybrid-microstructures fabrication which improves the trapping efficiency by optical tweezers. The hybrid-microstructure is composed of the photo-crosslinkable resin and polystyrene beads. The manipulation speed of the hybrid-microstructure increases when the optical tweezers trap the polystyrene beads. This is because the trapping efficiency of spherical configuration is higher than that of planar shape.

This mechanism is analyzed using numerical simulations and tested in pick-and-place experiments using commercial laser diode components. The advantage of the capillary microgripper has been demonstrated in picking and aligning microchips from adhesive films, which requires substantial picking force.",8
icra,None,Robotic cell manipulation with optical tweezers for biomechanical characterization,"Youhua Tan,Dong Sun,Shuk Han Cheng,Ronald A. Li,","In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of robotic cell stretching with optical tweezers for biomechanical characterization. Optical traps serve as end-effectors to manipulate micro-beads attached to the cell surface. The dynamics of the cell-bead mixture during cell stretching is investigated for the first time. Based on our previous work, cell stiffness is extracted and biomechanical properties of cells can be characterized. Our study shows that the modeling results agree with the experimental data. Further, the area compressibility moduli of two types of cells, human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM), are characterized. The results indicate that undifferentiated stem cells are much softer than differentiated ones, which provides an important insight into the cell mechanics during hESC differentiation. In summary, this paper successfully demonstrates that the robot-tweezer system can manipulate biological cells effectively to characterize biomechanical properties of living cells.",7
icra,None,Construction of mechano-bionic system using an environmentally robust insect muscle tissue,"Keisuke Morishima,Yoshitake Akiyama,Takayuki Hoshino,Kikuo Iwabuchi,","Here we present an environmentally robust mechano-bionic system using insect dorsal vessel tissues. Although mechano-bionic systems using mammalian heart muscle cells were reported previously, these mechano-bionic systems require precise environmental control to keep the heart muscle cells contracting spontaneously. To overcome this problem, our group focused on insect dorsal vessel tissues as a novel driving source of mechano-bionic system. We have shown so far that insect dorsal vessel can be utilized as driving source that is robust over culture conditions. In this paper, as a mechano-bionic system that is robust over its operating environment, we propose a micro-actuated system that consists of insect dorsal vessel and mechanical structure fabricated by micro fabrication technology. By photolithographic technique, the components of the machine were fabricated. The excised dorsal vessel was attached to the microstructure by tweezers under the stereomicroscope. The micro-mechanical components with dorsal vessel was incubated at 25°C, and after several hours of culture, it was actuated by contraction of dorsal vessel. Using image analysis, its maximum open-end displacement and operating frequency was measured around 27μm and 0.5Hz, respectively. We successfully demonstrated in constructing the mechano-bionic system that is robust over its operating environment.",0
icra,None,Adaptive backstepping and MEMS force sensor for an MRI-guided microrobot in the vasculature,"Laurent Arcese,Matthieu Fruchard,Felix Beyeler,Antoine Ferreira,,","-A microrobot consisting of a polymer binded aggregate of ferromagnetic particles is controlled using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) device in order to achieve targeted therapy. The primary contribution of this paper is the design of an adaptive backstepping controller coupled with a high gain observer based on a nonlinear model of a microrobot in a blood vessel. This work is motivated by the difficulty in accurately determining many biological parameters, which can result in parametric uncertainties to which model-based approaches are highly sensitive. We show that the most sensitive parameter, magnetization of the microrobot, can be measured using a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) force sensor, while the second one, the dielectric constant of blood, can be estimated on line. The efficacy of this approach is illustrated by simulation results.",24
icra,None,Handheld micromanipulation with vision-based virtual fixtures,"Brian C. Becker,Robert A. MacLachlan,Gregory D. Hager,Cameron N. Riviere,","Precise movement during micromanipulation becomes difficult in submillimeter workspaces, largely due to the destabilizing influence of tremor. Robotic aid combined with filtering techniques that suppress tremor frequency bands increases performance; however, if knowledge of the operator's goals is available, virtual fixtures have been shown to greatly improve micromanipulator precision. In this paper, we derive a control law for position-based virtual fixtures within the framework of an active handheld micromanipulator, where the fixtures are generated in real-time from microscope video. Additionally, we develop motion scaling behavior centered on virtual fixtures as a simple and direct extension to our formulation. We demonstrate that hard and soft (motion scaled) virtual fixtures outperform state-of-the-art tremor cancellation performance on a set of artificial but medically relevant tasks: holding, move-and-hold, curve tracing, and volume restriction.",43

The nano knife with a small edge angle 5° was fabricated from a commercial AFM cantilever by focused ion beam (FIB) etching. The spring constant of the nano knife was calibrated by nanorobotic manipulation method. A piezo actuator was employed to generate the vibration of the nano knife. The oscillating amplitude response to the applied voltage was calculated based on the realtime image observation. Single yeast cell (W303) cutting using oscillating nano knife was performed based on the nanorobotic manipulation system inside an environment-SEM.

icra,None,A strategy to abstract WCE video clips based on LDA,"Qian Zhao,Max Q.-H. Meng,","Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is a novel technique that allows visualization of the whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract especially the small intestine in a comfortable, non-invasive and efficacious way. The main disadvantage of WCE is that physicians need to examine a video of over 55,000 frames which is a time-consuming and labor intensive task. To address the problem, a strategy of WCE video clip abstraction based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is proposed in this paper. We extract multiple features based on which the frame differences are measured. Then the video clips are segmented using a non-parametric key-point detection algorithm and finally the most representative frames (MRFs) are extracted based on LDA algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed strategy achieves promising performances.",7
icra,None,Stable turning movement of a gait-controlled personal mobility “Tread-Walk 1”,"Takeshi Ando,Yu Ogawa,Yasutaka Nakashima,Eiichi Ohki,Yo Kobayashi,,,","We have been developing the new personal mobility aid, ""Tread-Walk 1,"" which is controlled by the driver's walking pace and amplifies walking velocity. The Tread-Walk 1 not only assists mobility but also helps the elderly maintain their physical abilities. However, the turning movement of the Tread-Walk is likely to be unstable, because the Tread-Walk is controlled by walking. In this paper, we focus on the stable turning movement of the Tread-Walk 1. First, we simulate the centrifugal force applied to the driver, which was not considered in our previous report. Then, a new algorithm to realize stable turning movement is established by measuring the driver's standing position. Finally, the developed algorithm for the turning movement of the Tread-Walk 1 is evaluated by measuring the handle grasping time. With the new algorithm, the Tread-Walk 1 turned steadily and driver did not lose their balance.",1
icra,None,A cable driven upper arm exoskeleton for upper extremity rehabilitation,"Ying Mao,Sunil K. Agrawal,","Conventional robotic rehabilitation devices for upper extremity are bulky, heavy or lack the ability to provide joint level rehabilitation. Some designs address these issues by replacing rigid links of the exoskeletons with light weight cables. However these designs are controlled in position mode instead of force control which is desirable for rehabilitation. In this paper, a 5 degree-of-freedom cable-driven upper arm exoskeleton, with control of force, is proposed. In this design, attachment points of cables on the arm are adjustable. The attachment points are optimized to achieve large workspace to perform activities of daily living. Simulation results of force field control for training and rehabilitation of the arm are presented. Experiments have been performed on a dummy robotic arm in the upper arm exoskeleton.",66

The results show that nearly 80% of the time the house maid used just six grasps and the machinist used nine.

icra,None,"Stable, adaptive interaction and contact transition control of a high inertia haptic interface for haptic simulation in gait rehabilitation","Sami Hussein,Moritz Büchel,Jörg Krüger,","In robot assisted rehabilitation the development of sophisticated training strategies using force and impedance control methods is an important field of research. The objective of the presented work is to provide a haptic control framework for end-effector based gait rehabilitation robots, which allows for the training of arbitrary foot trajectories of daily life and the design of sophisticated, patient-adaptive training environments. Due to the end-effector design principle the machine carries the patient's full bodyweight during the whole training cycle which implies excessively high forces at the interaction ports. To allow for a guided movement under the described conditions the machine features powerful drives and a massive, stiff mechanical structure. This results in exceptionally high device inertia comparable to heavy-duty industrial robots and normally not common in haptic displays. To ensure stable interaction with a passive user and a known range of stiff and viscose virtual environments an adaptive virtual coupling controller is developed. To minimize the complexity of design procedure, a linear, discrete-time coupled and contact transition stability analysis is derived, taking into account the known target range of environments. The developed haptic controller was implemented and tested experimentally on the robotic walking simulator HapticWalker. It was shown to interact stably with virtual environments within the defined stiffness bounds. Further a set of lower target impedance parameters was evaluated in free motion without contact. An algorithm for the adaptation of the target damping was suggested to improve transparency during free motion while still ensuring a stable contact transition and interaction with stiff environment objects. The feasibility of the adaptive coupling controller was proven in free motion and walking experiments on the HapticWalker with the simulation static and dynamic virtual environments.",6
icra,None,Inhibitory connections between neural oscillators for a robotic suit,"X. Zhang,M. Hashimoto,","A new synchronization-based control is proposed for a robotic suit which is designed for walking assistance. Neural oscillators are connected to each joint of the robotic suit to synchronize suit's movement with human user's movement (outer-synchronization). At the same time, mutual inhibition is incorporated between neural oscillators at each left and right joint of the suit to help to maintain a human-gait-like anti-phase relationship (inner-inhibition). We have developed a 2-DOF robotic suit, which consists of two actuators fixed to the places where the human hip joints are. Each actuator has a built-in torque sensor, which helps to measure the mutual joint torque generated by once there is any difference between the movement of a user and that of the suit. The mutual joint torque is used as input to neural oscillators, which control each actuator of the robotic suit through outer-synchronization with the mutual joint torque and inner-inhibition. The inhibitory weight, used to adjust the inhibitory strength between neural oscillators, is designed properly using series of simulations. We have conducted walking experiments to show the validity of our proposal for walking assistance of the robotic suit with mutual inhibition between neural oscillators.",10
icra,None,Learning approximate cost-to-go metrics to improve sampling-based motion planning,"Yanbo Li,Kostas E. Bekris,","Sampling-based planners have been shown to be effective in searching unexplored parts of a system's state space. Their desirable properties, however, depend on the availability of an appropriate metric, which is often difficult to be defined for some robots, such as non-holonomic and under-actuated ones. This paper investigates a methodology to approximate optimum cost-to-go metrics by employing an offline learning phase in an obstacle-free workspace. The proposed method densely samples a graph that approximates the connectivity properties of the state space. This graph can be used online to compute approximate distances between states using nearest neighbor queries and standard graph search algorithms, such as A*. Unfortunately, this process significantly increases the online cost of a sampling-based planner. This work then investigates ways for the computationally efficient utilization of the learned metric during the planner's online operation. One idea is to map the sampled states into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space through multi-dimensional scaling that retains the relative distances represented by the sampled graph. Simulations on a first-order car and on an illustrative example of an asymmetric state space indicate that the approach has merit and can lead into more effective planning.",28
icra,None,Adaptive reactionless motion for space manipulator when capturing an unknown tumbling target,"Thai-Chau Nguyen-Huynh,Inna Sharf,","This paper presents a new adaptive algorithm to generate reactionless motion for a space manipulator during and after capturing an unknown tumbling target. The intended application scenario is on-orbit servicing whereby the service spacecraft/manipulator system must dock to, or get a hold of the target satellite in order to conduct the required operations. In the course of these missions, it is important to maintain the base attitude of the servicer unchanged. However, the changes in the dynamics parameters of the system, as a result of capturing an unknown target, degrade the performance of the attitude stabilization system. To overcome this problem in the post capture scenario, the adaptive reactionless control algorithm to produce the arm motions with minimum disturbance to the base, without knowledge of target dynamics, is proposed in this study. This algorithm is intended for use in the transition phase from the instant of capture till the unknown parameters are identified and/or the available stabilization methods can be applied properly. The proposed approach is developed based on the momentum conservation of the system, while recursive least squares algorithm is employed for parameter adaptation. To verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed concept, MSC Adams simulation platform is employed to implement a planar base-manipulator-target model. Two basic scenarios are considered: one where the initial (prior to capture) angular momentum of the target is zero and the second where the target is spinning. The numerical results show that the space manipulator is able to perform reactionless motion after capturing an unknown spinning target.",49
icra,None,Nonholonomic path planning optimization for Dubins' vehicles,"Douglas G.

We present an improved solution that computes paths through two-dimensional waypoints, that are shorter than those produced by one of the most used techniques in the literature. We initially present an optimization cost function that proves to be better suited for the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicles that are the focus of this work. We also propose an improvement for the Alternating Algorithm, used to determinate the orientation angles on the calculation of the Dubins' Path through the waypoints. Finally, we use a recently developed optimization meta-heuristic, called Continuous-GRASP (C-GRASP), to generate a path that is shorter than paths obtained with classical techniques. Our results show significant improvements on the search for optimal paths for the case of nonholonomic vehicles. Our methodology was thoroughly evaluated and validated in simulation, and the results have shown a decrease on path's length of 28% on average, compared with the classic technique found in literature. In some cases a reduction of approximately 50% was obtained.",56
icra,None,Real-time motion planning for the macro-micro parallel manipulator system,"XueChao Duan,Yuanying Qiu,Jingli Du,Ze Zhao,Qingjuan Duan,","In order to achieve the high motion precision of the macro-micro parallel manipulator system for a large radio telescope, its real-time motion planning is dealt with in this paper. To uniquely determine the spatial position and orientation of the cable driven parallel manipulator, the real-time optimization is conducted according to the principle of uniform tension in the six driving cables. Synchronized points and the “judge and wait” mechanism ensure the continuity and synchrony of the trajectory tracking of the two parallel manipulators. The preadjustment of the micro parallel manipulator reduces the drastic dynamical coupling as a result of the fast movement of the micro manipulator. Besides, over-workspace avoidance procedure is introduced to restrict the micro parallel manipulator not to exceed it workspace. Experimental results validate the high precision of the macro-micro parallel manipulator system with supervisory controller and the motion prediction algorithm.",5
icra,None,Optimal motion planning for a class of hybrid dynamical systems with impacts,"Andrew W. Long,Todd D. Murphey,Kevin M. Lynch,",Hybrid dynamical systems with impacts typically have controls that can influence the time of the impact as well as the result of the impact. The leg angle of a hopping robot is an example of an impact control because it can influence when the impact occurs and the direction of the impulse. This paper provides a method for computing an explicit expression for the first derivative of a cost function encoding a desired trajectory. The first derivative can be used with standard optimization algorithms to find the optimal impact controls for motion planning of hybrid dynamical systems with impacts. The resulting derivation is implemented for a simplified model of a dynamic climbing robot.,12
icra,None,Dictionary learning for robust background modeling,"Ravishankar Sivalingam,Alden D'Souza,Michael Bazakos,Roland Miezianko,,,","Background subtraction is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications, such as robotics and automated surveillance systems. The performance of high-level visions tasks such as object detection and tracking is dependent on effective foreground detection techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel background modeling algorithm that represents the background as a linear combination of dictionary atoms and the foreground as a sparse error, when one uses the respective set of dictionary atoms as basis elements to linearly approximate/reconstruct a new image. The dictionary atoms represent variations of the background model, and are learned from the training frames. The sparse foreground estimation during the training and performance phases is formulated as a Lasso [1] problem, while the dictionary update step in the training phase is motivated from the K-SVD algorithm [2]. Our proposed method works well in the presence of foreground in the training frames, and also gives the foreground masks for the training frames as a by-product of the batch training phase. Experimental validation is provided on standard datasets with ground truth information, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shown.",26

In this article, we provide a way to simplify the user's task of understanding the scene by rendering the camera view as if observed from the user's perspective by estimating his position using a real-time visual SLAM system. Augmenting the view is referred to as hidden view synthesis. Compared to previous work, the current approach improves by simplifying the setup and requiring minimal user input. This is achieved by building a map of the environment using a visual SLAM system and then registering the surveillance camera in this map. By exploiting the map, a different moving camera can render hidden views in real-time at 30Hz. We discuss some of the challenges remaining for full automation.

These strategies are then used to compute a schedule and task assignment for all agents. We improve the graph construction from previous work and for the first time present a method that computes a schedule to minimize the execution time. For this we consider travel times of agents determined by a path planner on the height map. We demonstrate the entire system in a real environment with an area of 700,000m 2 in which eight human agents search for two intruders using mobile computing devices (iPads).

icra,None,Visibility-based pursuit-evasion with probabilistic evader models,"Nicholas M. Stiffler,Jason M. O'Kane,","We propose an algorithm for a visibility-based pursuit-evasion problem in a simply-connected two-dimensional environment, in which a single pursuer has access to a probabilistic model describing how the evaders are likely to move in the environment. The application of our algorithm can be best viewed in the context of search and rescue: Although the victims (evaders) are not actively trying to escape from the robot, it is necessary to consider the task of locating the victims as a pursuit-evasion problem to obtain a firm guarantee that all of the victims are found. We present an algorithm that draws sample evader trajectories from the probabilistic model to compute a plan that lowers the Expected Time to Capture the evaders without drastically increasing the Guaranteed Time to Capture the evaders. We introduce a graph structure that takes advantage of the sampled evader trajectories to compute a path that would ""see"" all the evaders if they followed only those trajectories in our sampled set. We then use a previous technique to append our path with actions that provide a complete solution for the visibility-based pursuit evasion problem. The resulting plan guarantees that all evaders are located, even if they do not obey the given probabilistic motion model. We implemented the algorithm in a simulation and provide a quantitative comparison to existing methods.",8

Most of the strategies proposed in literature are based on the idea of evaluating a number of candidate locations according to ad hoc utility functions that combine different criteria. In this paper, we show some of the advantages of using a more theoretically-grounded approach, based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), to define exploration strategies for robots employed in search and rescue applications. We implemented our MCDM-based exploration strategies within an existing robot controller and we evaluated their performance in a simulated environment.",7

However, passive systems sometimes cannot generate enough force to guide the human hand along the desired path because the servo brakes cannot generate a driving force and the system does not have enough brake units to generate the desired force. In this paper, we theoretically consider the feasible braking force region of a passive system with multiple brake units and discuss the number of brake units required to generate the desired force appropriately. We also develop a system based on our analysis of the feasible braking force and conduct path-following experiments.

icra,None,Dynamic shared control for human-wheelchair cooperation,"Qinan Li,Weidong Chen,Jingchuan Wang,","Shared control is a common used method for human and wheelchair cooperation. However, most of the previous shared control methods didn't think much of the effect caused by the difference in the user's control ability. The control weight of a user in these methods is irrelevant to the user's capability or the driving conditions. In this paper, a dynamic shared control method is proposed to adapt wheelchair's assistance to the variations of user performance and the environmental changes. Three evaluation indices including safety, comfort and obedience are designed to evaluate wheelchair performance in real time. A minimax multi-objective optimization algorithm is adopted to calculate the user's control weight. The results of lab experiments and elderly home field tests show that this method can adapt the degree of wheelchair's autonomy to the user's control ability and it makes driving wheelchair much easier for elder people.",98
icra,None,Compensation for biodynamic feedthrough in backhoe operation by cab vibration control,"Heather C. Humphreys,Wayne J. Book,James D. Huggins,","This research investigates and seeks to mitigate the undesirable effects of biodynamic feedthrough in backhoe operation. Biodynamic feedthrough occurs when motion of the controlled machine excites motion of the human operator, which is fed back into the control input device. This unwanted input can cause significant performance degradation, which can include limit cycles or even instability. Backhoe user interface designers indicate that this is a problem in many conventional machines, and it has also proved to degrade performance in this testbed. A particular backhoe control system, including the biodynamic feedthrough, is modeled and simulated. Cab vibration control is selected as a means to mitigate the biodynamic feedthrough effect. Two controller based methods are developed based on these models and presented, both of which use the working implement itself to reduce the cab motion. In this case, the backhoe arm has dual functionality, to perform excavation operations and to cancel cab vibration. Results show that significant reductions in cab motion can be obtained with minimal tracking performance degradation, without additional actuators.",11

icra,None,Unsupervised learning of object affordances for planning in a mobile manipulation platform,"Emre Ugur,Erol Şahin,Erhan Oztop,","In this paper, we use the notion of affordances, proposed in cognitive science, as a framework to propose a developmental method that would enable a robot to ground symbolic planning mechanisms in the continuous sensory-motor experiences of a robot. We propose a method that allows a robot to learn the symbolic relations that pertain to its interactions with the world and show that they can be used in planning. Specifically, the robot interacts with the objects in its environment using a pre-coded repertoire of behaviors and records its interactions in a triple that consist of the initial percept of the object, the behavior applied and its effect, defined as the difference between the initial and the final percept. The method allows the robot to learn object affordance relations which can be used to predict the change in the percept of the object when a certain behavior is applied. These relations can then be used to develop plans using forward chaining. The method is implemented and evaluated on a mobile robot system with limited object manipulation capabilities. We have shown that the robot is able to learn the physical affordances of objects from range images and use them to build symbols and relations that can be used in making multi-step predictions about the affordances of objects and achieve complex goals.",20

We study the class of sensors with bilinear dynamics, for which the derivative of the observations is a bilinear form of the control commands and the observations themselves. This class of models is simple, yet general enough to represent the main phenomena of three representative sensors (field sampler, camera, and range-finder), apparently very different from one another. It also allows a bootstrapping algorithm based on Hebbian learning, and a simple bioplausible control strategy.

Learning a task model allows the robot to anticipate the partner's intentions and adapt its motion according to perceived forces. As the human represents a highly complex contact environment, direct reproduction of the learned model may lead to sub-optimal results. To compensate for unmodelled uncertainties, in addition to learning we propose an adaptive control algorithm that tunes the impedance parameters, so as to ensure accurate reproduction.

This paper presents a methodology to allow a robot to navigate in a complex environment by observing pedestrian positional traces. A continuous probabilistic function is determined using Gaussian process learning and used to infer the direction a robot should take in different parts of the environment. The approach learns and filters noise in the data producing a smooth underlying function that yields more natural movements. Our method combines prior conventional planning strategies with most probable trajectories followed by people in a principled statistical manner, and adapts itself online as more observations become available. The use of learning methods are automatic and require minimal tuning as compared to potential fields or spline function regression.

icra,None,Bayesian on-line learning of driving behaviors,"Jérôme Maye,Rudolph Triebel,Luciano Spinello,Roland Siegwart,","This paper presents a novel self-supervised online learning method to discover driving behaviors from data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera. Both sensors where mounted in a car that was driven by a human through a typical city environment with intersections, pedestrian crossings and traffic lights. The presented system extracts motion segments from the IMU data and relates them to visual cues obtained from camera data. It employs a Bayesian on-line estimation method to discover the motion segments based on change-point detection and uses a Dirichlet Compound Multinomial (DCM) model to represent the visual features extracted from the camera images. By incorporating these visual cues into the on-line estimation process, labels are computed that are equal for similar motion segments. As a result, typical traffic situations such as braking maneuvers in front of a red light can be identified automatically. Furthermore, appropriate actions in form of observed motion changes are associated to the discovered traffic situations. The approach is evaluated on a real data set acquired in the center of Zurich.",26

Then, the duration of one tooth period is divided into the free vibration and the forced vibration processes. While the former one has an analytical solution, the discretization technique is explored to approximate the solution of the latter one. After the forced vibration duration being equally discretized, the Gauss-Legendre formula is used to discretize the definite integral, in the meantime the Lagrange interpolation is adopted for approximating the state item and the time-delay item by using the corresponding discretized state points and time-delay state points. The approximate Floquet transition matrix is thereafter constructed to predict the milling stability based on the Floquet theory. The benchmark examples are utilized to verify the proposed method. Compared with previous time domain methods, the proposed method enables higher rate of convergence. The results also demonstrate that the proposed method is high-effective.",3

Lennartson,","Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) is a model based framework for automatically synthesizing a supervisor that minimally restricts the behavior of a plant such that a given specification is fulfilled. A problem, which prevents SCT from having a major breakthrough industrially, is that the supervisory synthesis often suffers from the state-space explosion problem. To alleviate this problem, a well-known strategy is to represent and explore the state-space symbolically by using Binary Decision Diagrams. Based on this principle, an efficient symbolic state-space traversal approach, depending on the disjunctive partitioning technique, is presented and the correctness of it is proved. Finally, the efficiency of the presented approach is demonstrated on a set of benchmark examples.",6
icra,None,Design of handling device for caging and aligning circular objects,"Yasuhisa Hirata,Aya Kaisumi,Kengo Yamaguchi,Kazuhiro Kosuge,","In this study, we consider the development of a device for handling small parts for automatic product assembly in factories. Many robotic hands and one-degree-of-freedom grippers have been proposed as grasping parts; here, we focus on the shape of the tips of a handling device for picking up small parts robustly and agilely. In this research, we propose a concept for a handling device for picking up small round parts. In this concept, the handling device cages an object without letting the object escape from its tips before closing them completely and then grasps the object robustly at a unique position of the tips. Using this caging and self-alignment concept, the handling device can pick up objects robustly and agilely. In this paper, we focus on a method for designing the shape of the device's tips using the concept of caging and self alignment of objects. We also develop the robust and agile pick up device (RAPiD) with tips designed by the new method and present experimental results that illustrate the validity of the concept and the ability of RAPiD to handle small parts.",18

The network-induced delays are considered for accurately estimating the contour error in real-time.

icra,None,Vision-based 3D bicycle tracking using deformable part model and Interacting Multiple Model filter,"Hyunggi Cho,Paul E. Rybski,Wende Zhang,","This paper presents a monocular vision based 3D bicycle tracking framework for intelligent vehicles based on a detection method exploiting a deformable part model and a tracking method using an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm. Bicycle tracking is important because bicycles share the road with vehicles and can move at comparable speeds in urban environments. From a computer vision standpoint, bicycle detection is challenging as bicycle's appearance can change dramatically between viewpoints and a person riding on the bicycle is a non-rigid object. To this end, we present a tracking-by-detection method to detect and track bicycles that takes into account these difficult issues. First, a mixture model of multiple viewpoints is defined and trained via a Latent Support Vector Machine (LSVM) to detect bicycles under a variety of circumstances. Each model uses a part based representation. This robust bicycle detector provides a series of measurements (i.e., bounding boxes) in the context of the Kalman filter. Second, to exploit the unique characteristics of bicycle tracking, two motion models based on bicycle's kinematics are fused using an IMM algorithm. For each motion model, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the position and velocity of a bicycle in the vehicle coordinates. Finally, a single bicycle tracking method using an IMM algorithm is extended to that of multiple bicycle tracking by incorporating a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter which runs a particle filter for a data association and an IMM filter for each bicycle tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of experiments run on a new bicycle dataset captured from a vehicle-mounted camera.",32
icra,None,Structured sparse representation appearance model for robust visual tracking,"Tianxiang Bai,Y. F. Li,Yazhe Tang,","We propose a robust visual tracker based on structured sparse representation appearance model. The appearance of tracking target is modeled as a sparse linear combination of Eigen templates plus a sparse error due to occlusions. We address the structured sparse representation that preferably matches the practical visual tracking problem by taking the contiguous spatial distribution of occlusion into account. The sparsity is achieved by Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (BOMP) for solving structured sparse representation problem more efficiently. The model update scheme, based on incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), guarantees the Eigen templates that are able to capture the variations of target appearance online. Then the approximation error is adopted to build a probabilistic observation model that integrates with a stochastic affine motion model to form a particle filter framework for visual tracking. Thanks to the block structure of sparse representation and BOMP, our proposed tracker demonstrates superiority on both efficiency and robustness improvement in comparison experiments with publicly available benchmark video sequences.",19
icra,None,Hybrid Kalman filter for improvement of camera-based position sensor,"Edouard Laroche,Shingo Kagami,Loïc Cuvillon,","When using a camera as a position sensor, the measurement is limited in bandwidth, mainly due to the blur effects. The knowledge of an accurate model of the camera is then necessary to reconstruct the trajectory from the measurements given by the camera. This paper deals with the reconstruction of the continuous-time trajectory from the discrete-time measurements provided by the camera and shows the improvement obtained by using an accurate camera model. In the proposed methodology, a Kalman filter is used for the data fusion between the model and the measurement. The tuning and implementation of the filter are discussed in the specific context of the camera measurement. The system is evaluated in the context of a biomedical application: the reconstruction of the movement of a beating-heart.",2
icra,None,Boosting scalable gradient features for adaptive real-time tracking,"Dominik A. Klein,Armin B. Cremers,","Recently, several image gradient and edge based features have been introduced. In unison, they all discovered that object shape is a strong cue for recognition and tracking. Generally their basic feature extraction relies on pixel-wise gradient or edge computation using discrete filter masks, while scale invariance is later achieved by higher level operations like accumulating histograms or abstracting edgels to line segments. In this paper we show a novel and fast way to compute region based gradient features which are scale invariant themselves. We developed specialized, quick learnable weak classifiers that are integrated into our adaptively boosted observation model for particle filter based tracking. With an ensemble of region based gradient features this observation model is able to reliably capture the shape of the tracked object. The observation model is adapted to new object and background appearances while tracking. Thus we developed advanced methods to decide when to update the model, or in other words, if the filter is on target or not. We evaluated our approach using the BoBoT 1 as well as the PROST 2 datasets.",34
icra,None,Real-time direct tracking of color images in the presence of illumination variation,"Tiago Gonçalves,Andrew I. Comport,","This paper introduces a novel color tracking model for image registration that exploits directly the color information provided by standard color cameras. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, the color tracking model is designed to handle both global and local illumination changes within a robust framework that also rejects outliers such as occluding objects, shadows, etc. In order to demonstrate the proposed approach a planar template tracking algorithm is used, however, the approach is also valid for a general class of direct tracking algorithms. In particular, the objective function is defined to be minimized directly in the CFA (color filter array) space instead of the common RGB space. It will be shown that this not only takes advantage of the discernibility of color measurements but also drastically improves the efficiency of the vision processing pipeline and ultimately improves real-time performance. A robust global illumination model is then combined with a robust M-estimation technique that is shown to handle outliers as well as global and local illumination changes. Results from synthetic and real sequences are presented to demonstrate the proposed concept.",29

icra,None,Non-parametric UAV system identification with dependent Gaussian processes,"Prasad Hemakumara,Salah Sukkarieh,","A mathematical model for a complex system such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) requires estimation of aerodynamic, inertial and structural properties of the many elements of the platform. This physical modeling approach is labor intensive and requires coarse approximations to be made in calculations. Similarly, models constructed through flight tests are only applicable to a narrow flight envelope and classical system identification approaches require prior knowledge of the model structure, which in some instance may only be partially known. To tackle these problems, we introduce a novel aircraft system identification method based on dependent Gaussian processes. The approach allows high fidelity non linear flight dynamic models to be constructed through flight testing. The proposed algorithm learns the system parameters as well as captures any dependencies between them. The method is demonstrated by generating a model of the force and moment coefficients for the Brumby Mklll UAV from real flight data. The learnt dynamic model identifies coupling between flight modes, provides an estimate of uncertainty, and is applicable to a broader range of the flight envelope.",22

The code is optimized to run entirely onboard, so no wireless link and ground station are explicitly needed. A major focus in our work is modularity, allowing each component to be benchmarked individually, or swapped out for a different implementation, without change to the rest of the system.

However, one key challenge to the widespread deployment of mobile robots equipped with multiple sensors and processing algorithms is the ability to autonomously tailor sensing and information processing to the task at hand. This paper poses this challenge as the task of planning under uncertainty, and more specifically as an instance of probabilistic sequential decision-making. A novel hierarchy of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is incorporated, which uses constrained-convolutional policies and automatic belief propagation to achieve efficient and reliable operation on mobile robots. All algorithms are implemented and evaluated on simulated and physical robot platforms for the task of searching for target objects in dynamic indoor environments.",4

icra,None,Spectral properties of expansive configuration spaces: An empirical study,"Mhequb Hayat,Abubakr Muhammad,","Motion planning in high dimensional configuration space is an intractable problem. Sampling based motion planning is considered as one of the best ways to tackle the ""curse of dimensionality"" and to model the configuration space. In these methods (e.g. probabilistic roadmap (PRM)), a graph is produced by random nodes of valid configurations. As the number of the nodes N increases, for expansive configuration spaces the failure probability of PRM planner exponentially approaches zero; but computing expansiveness property is not feasible for most interesting problems. Another major hurdle is narrow passages detection. Therefore, we need easily computable ways to characterize the properties of configuration spaces. We propose a new framework for narrow passage detection using spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian of the PRM. We give empirical evidences to show that eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal useful information about number and size of narrow passages, visibility and expansiveness. Simulations on various motion planning scenarios are done to verify the framework.",1

The robots are assumed to undergo planar motion considering nonholonomic constraints. The goal of the task is to control the multi-robot system to a desired configuration relying solely on visual information given by the flying camera. The desired multi-robot configuration is defined with an image of the set of robots in that configuration. Then, any arbitrary configuration can be easily defined by this image without any additional information.

By modeling the problem as a Boolean Control Network, we can efficiently keep track of which regions are cleared, and which are not, while the input nodes of the network are used to represent the motion of the pursuers. The environment is partitioned into a set of convex regions, where each region correspond to a set of nodes in the network.

Estimates are improved through the online identification of diverse measurement biases, and a novel method for con current position estimation and accelerometer bias estimation is presented. Almost global asymptotic convergence of the pose observer is proved based on a Lyapunov-like approach, and several implementation issues are addressed. Comparison with classical existing methods illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach.",22
icra,None,Real-time metric state estimation for modular vision-inertial systems,"Stephan Weiss,Roland Siegwart,","Single camera solutions such as monocular visual odometry or monoSLAM approaches - found a wide echo in the community. All the monocular approaches, however, suffer from the lack of metric scale. In this paper, we present a solution to tackle this issue by adding an inertial sensor equipped with a three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. In contrast to previous approaches, our solution is independent of the underlying vision algorithm which estimates the camera poses. As a direct consequence, the algorithm presented here operates at a constant computational complexity in real time. We treat the visual framework as a black box and thus the approach is modular and widely applicable to existing monocular solutions. It can be used with any pose estimation algorithm such as visual odometry, visual SLAM, monocular or stereo setups or even GPS solutions with gravity and compass attitude estimation. In this paper, we show the thorough development of the metric state estimation based on an Extended Kalman Filter. Furthermore, even though we treat the visual framework as a black box, we show how to detect failures and estimate drifts in it. We implement our solution on a monocular vision pose estimation framework and show the results both in simulation and on real data.",242
icra,None,Closed-form solution for attitude and speed determination by fusing monocular vision and inertial sensor measurements,"Agostino Martinelli,","This paper considers the problem of data fusion when the adopted sensors are a monocular camera and inertial sensors (i.e. one tri-axial accelerometer and one tri-axial gyrometer). The investigation starts by performing an observability analysis to analytically derive all the observable modes, i.e. all the physical quantities that the information contained in the sensor data allows us to estimate. They are the position of the features in the camera frame, the vehicle speed in the same local frame and the absolute roll and pitch angles. The main contribution of the paper is a new algorithm to simultaneously estimate all the previous physical quantities. In particular, the algorithm is based on a closed-form solution which analytically expresses the vehicle speed and attitude in terms of the sensor measurements. In this algorithm the camera only needs to observe four times a single point feature in the environment. This allows performing the overall estimation in a very short time interval and without the need of any initialization or a priori knowledge. This is a key advantage since allows eliminating the drift on the scale factor and on the vehicle orientation. In addition, the algorithm can be easily extended in order to deal with biased inertial measurements and to deal with multiple features, in which case only three distinct camera poses are required (instead of four). Specifically, with three camera poses and two features, the vehicle speed and attitude together with the scale factor can be determined. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations and by using real data.",25

Notably, we show that this is possible by just using three consecutive camera positions and a single feature correspondence. Our approach represents a compact linear and multirate solution for estimating complementary information to regular essential matrix computation, namely the scale of the problem. The algorithm is thoroughly validated on simulated and real data and conditions for good quality of the results are identified.",58
icra,None,Addressing cost-space chasms in manipulation planning,"Dmitry Berenson,Thierry Siméon,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,","Finding paths in high-dimensional spaces becomes difficult when we wish to optimize the cost of a path in addition to obeying feasibility constraints. Recently the T-RRT algorithm was presented as a method to plan in high-dimensional cost spaces and it was shown to perform well across a variety of problems. However, since the T-RRT relies solely on sampling to explore the space, it has difficulty navigating cost-space chasms narrow low-cost regions surrounded by increasing cost. Such chasms are particularly common in planning for manipulators because many useful cost functions induce narrow or lower dimensional low-cost areas. This paper presents the GradienT-RRT algorithm, which combines the T-RRT with a local gradient method to bias the search toward lower-cost regions. GradienT-RRT is effective at navigating chasms because it explores low-cost regions that are too narrow to explore by sampling alone. We compare the performance of T-RRT and GradienT-RRT on planning problems involving cost functions defined in workspace, task space, and C-space. We find that GradienT-RRT outperforms T-RRT in terms of the cost of the final path while maintaining better or comparable computation time. We also find that the cost of paths generated by GradienT-RRT is far less sensitive to changes in a key parameter, making it easier to tune the algorithm. Finally, we conclude with a demonstration of GradienT-RRT on a planning-with-uncertainty task on the physical HFRB robot.",63
icra,None,STOMP: Stochastic trajectory optimization for motion planning,"Mrinal Kalakrishnan,Sachin Chitta,Evangelos Theodorou,Peter Pastor,,","We present a new approach to motion planning using a stochastic trajectory optimization framework. The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory, which are then combined to produced an updated trajectory with lower cost. A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.",693
icra,None,Combining high-level causal reasoning with low-level geometric reasoning and motion planning for robotic manipulation,"Esra Erdem,Kadir Haspalamutgil,Can Palaz,Volkan Patoglu,Tansel Uras,","We present a formal framework that combines high-level representation and causality-based reasoning with low-level geometric reasoning and motion planning. The frame-work features bilateral interaction between task and motion planning, and embeds geometric reasoning in causal reasoning, thanks to several advantages inherited from its underlying components. In particular, our choice of using a causality-based high-level formalism for describing action domains allows us to represent ramifications and state/transition constraints, and embed in such formal domain descriptions externally defined functions implemented in some programming language (e.g., C++). Moreover, given such a domain description, the causal reasoner based on this formalism (i.e., the Causal Calculator) allows us to compute optimal solutions (e.g., shortest plans) for elaborate planning/prediction problems with temporal constraints. Utilizing these features of high-level representation and reasoning, we can combine causal reasoning, motion planning and geometric planning to find feasible kinematic solutions to task-level problems. In our framework, the causal reasoner guides the motion planner by finding an optimal task-plan; if there is no feasible kinematic solution for that task-plan then the motion planner guides the causal reasoner by modifying the planning problem with new temporal constraints. Furthermore, while computing a task-plan, the causal reasoner takes into account geometric models and kinematic relations by means of external predicates implemented for geometric reasoning (e.g., to check some collisions); in that sense the geometric reasoner guides the causal reasoner to find feasible kinematic solutions. We illustrate an application of this framework to robotic manipulation, with two pantograph robots on a complex assembly task that requires concurrent execution of actions. A short video of this application accompanies the paper.",167

This paper describes how to design optimal trajectories that exploit goal sets. We extend CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning), a recent trajectory optimizer that has proven effective on high-dimensional problems, to handle trajectory-wide constraints, and relate the solution to the intuition of taking unconstrained steps and subsequently projecting them onto the constraints. We then show how this projection simplifies for goal sets (i.e. constraints that affect only the end-point). Finally, we present experiments on a personal robotics platform that show the importance of exploiting goal sets in trajectory optimization for day-to-day manipulation tasks.",75
icra,None,A robust miniature robot design for land/air hybrid locomotion,"Alex Kossett,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","The utility of miniature ground robots has long been limited by reduced locomotion capabilities compared to larger robots.

The robot design is presented with an emphasis on mechanical aspects. The design utilizes a minimalistic two-wheeled ground mode to minimize weight, and a rotary-wing flight mode, enabling transformations at will. The transition between modes requires a transformation wherein the robot tips itself on-end and unfolds rotors or vise versa. The design presented herein is an improvement upon previous designs using the same concept; it is more robust in both its transformation process and locomotion capabilities [1], [2].

The ability to print robots introduces a fast and low-cost fabrication method to modern, real-world robotic applications. To this end, we employ laser-engraved origami patterns to build a new class of robotic systems for mobility and manipulation. Origami is suitable for printable robotics as it uses only a flat sheet as the base structure for building complicated functional shapes, which can be utilized as robot bodies. An arbitrarily complex folding pattern can be used to yield an array of functionalities, in the form of actuated hinges or active spring elements.

icra,None,Exploiting natural dynamics for energy minimization using an Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS),"Amir Jafari,Nikos G. Tsagarakis,Darwin G. Caldwell,","In repetitive trajectories, adaptable compliance actuators can minimize energy consumption thanks to their ability to adjust the level of stiffness which allows the exploitation of the natural dynamics of their link based on the desired motion's frequency. However for most of these actuators in case of a variable frequency motion, it is not energetically beneficial to exploit the natural dynamics in the real time due to the considerably high amount of energy needed to change the stiffness. AwAS (Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness) achieves the stiffness regulation not through the control of the spring pretension (as in most of the existing variable stiffness joints) but by controlling the location of the spring elements. An important consequence of this mechanism is that the displacement needed to change the stiffness is perpendicular to the forces generated by the springs which in turn helps to minimize the energy/power required to regulate the stiffness. It is experimentally shown that AwAS is capable of minimizing energy consumption through exploiting the natural dynamics in real time for both fixed and variable frequency motions.",49
icra,None,AwAS-II: A new Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness based on the novel principle of adaptable pivot point and variable lever ratio,"Amir Jafari,Nikos G. Tsagarakis,Darwin G. Caldwell,","The Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS) is an actuator which can independently control equilibrium position and stiffness by two motors. The first motor controls the equilibrium position while the second motor regulates the compliance. This paper describes the design and development of AwAS-II which is an improved version of the original realization. AwAS tuned the stiffness by controlling the location of the springs and adjusting its arm, length. Instead AwAS-II regulates the compliance by implementing a force amplifier based on a lever mechanism on which a pivot point can adjust the force amplification ratio from zero to infinitive. As in the first implementation, the actuator which is responsible for adjusting the stiffness in AwAS II is not working against the spring forces. Its displacement is perpendicular to the force generated by springs which makes changing the stiffness energetically efficient. As the force amplification ratio can theoretically change from zero to infinitive consequently the level of stiffness can tune from very soft to completely rigid. Because this range does not depends on the spring's rate and length of the lever, thus soft springs and small lever can be used which result in a lighter and more compact setup. Furthermore as the lever arm is shorter the time required for the stiffness regulation is smaller.",218
icra,None,A compact compliant actuator (CompAct™) with variable physical damping,"Matteo Laffranchi,Nikos Tsagarakis,D.G. Caldwell,","The new areas of technical exploitation of robotics systems has recently set new trends for the robotic actuation by demanding more versatile systems which can cope with unpredictable interactions within not well defined environments and work in close vicinity with the human. Following these trends, this work presents the development of a new actuation system with embodied characteristics such as passive compliance and variable physical damping. Compared to the other existing compliant linear or rotary actuators the proposed CompAct unit has the ability to regulate the oscillations induced by the introduction of the compliance by means of a variable physical damping actuator (VPDA) unit. Apart from facilitating the control the VPDA unit can assist in managing the energy transfer from/to the compliant module. The mechatronics, model and control scheme of the CompAct are analysed. The overall system is evaluated with experimental trials performed using a prototype unit. Preliminary results are presented to show that the unit and the proposed control scheme are capable of regulating the impedance components (stiffness and damping) within a wide range and with good fidelity.",69
icra,None,Changing human upper-limb synergies with an exoskeleton using viscous fields,"Vincent Crocher,Nathanaël Jarrassé,Anis Sahbani,Agnès Roby-Brami,,","Robotic exoskeletons can apply forces distributed on the limbs of the subject they are connected to. This offers a great potential in the field of neurorehabilitation, to address the impairment of interjoint coordination in hemiparetic stroke patients. In these patients, the normal flexible joint rotation synergies are replaced by pathological fixed patterns of rotation. In this paper, we investigate how the concept of synergy can be exploited in the control of an upper limb exoskeleton. The long term goal is to develop a device capable of changing the joint synchronization of a patient performing exercises during rehabilitation. The paper presents a controller able of generating joint viscous torques in such a way that constraints on joint velocities can be imposed to the subject without constraining the hand motion. On another hand, the same formalism is used to describe synergies observed on the arm joint motion of subjects realizing pointing tasks. This approach is experimented on a 4 Degrees Of Freedom (DoF) upper arm exoskeleton with subjects performing pointing 3-dimensional tasks. Results exhibit the basic properties of the controller and show its capacity to impose an arbitrary chosen synergy without affecting the hand motion.",8
icra,None,Development of drawing assist system for patients with cerebral palsy of the tension athetosis type,"Hiroaki Aoyama,Tomoyuki Nakao,Naruto Miyagawa,Naoki Kubota,,,","Creative activities, such as painting and music, are one source of satisfaction and fulfillment for people with disabilities. However, some individuals with a disability can not satisfactorily enjoy such activities because of involuntary movement or spasms. In this study, we developed a drawing assist system for patients with cerebral palsy of the tension athetosis type, who experience spasticity that makes it difficult for the assist system to distinguish involuntary movement from voluntary movement. We designed a variable filter to attenuate involuntary movement on the basis of the behavioral characteristics of the velocity component with respect to in voluntary movement. Our system enabled drawing based on the participant's own senses and motor control, even when experiencing involuntary movement.",7

Preliminary clinical study is conducted on amputees. EMG data from the residual muscles of three amputees are used to evaluate the new features, discriminant bispectra (DBS) and discriminant Fourier cepstrum (DFC). The performance is also compared with other traditional features, autoregressive (AR) coefficient, time domain statics (TDS), and power spectral distribution (PSD). Some promising results are presented. It shows that DFC and DBS outperforms the other features. The implementation of EMG algorithm is accomplished.

icra,None,Development of a robot which can simulate swallowing of food boluses with various properties for the study of rehabilitation of swallowing disorders,"Yohan Noh,Masanao Segawa,Kei Sato,Chunbao Wang,Hiroyuki Ishii,,,,,","Many patients suffer from swallowing disorders (dysphagia). There are many treatments for these disorders, such as swallowing therapy, surgery, and dietary modification. In our study, we focuse on dietary modification, a common approach. Normally, the swallowing is affected by food bolus properties such as hardness, stickiness and rheological characteristics, and dietary modifications can prevent swallowing disorder patients from suffering dysphagia (aspiration), as well as promote good nutrition. Based on these facts, our goal is to find foods which do not cause dysphagia, and develop food for swallowing disorder patients accordingly. Therefore, we are proposing an in-vitro Dynamic VFSS (Video Fluorographic Swallowing Study) simulation system which uses advanced robotics technology to mimic the dynamic process of swallowing and monitors the status and movement of the food bolus inside the system, for objective evaluation of the swallowing process. The dynamic VFSS simulation system consists of a head, mandible, neck, tongue, pharynx, and larynx which reproduce human anatomy. It is driven by 16 actuators with wire driving mechanisms. In this paper, we will present the dynamic VFSS simulation unit in detail. In addition, we will detail a set of the experiments carried out to determine whether food bolus properties can affect dysphagia or not. To observe the movement of the food bolus, we use a Video Fluoroscopy (VF) unit. The results of the experiments show that thickened boluses have a tendency to leave residue in the epiglottic vallecula. In contrast, liquids cause less residue, and increase the risk of dysphagia (aspiration). Moreover, this study shows that the frontal image, as well as the lateral image, is important for evaluating residual food in the oral- pharyngeal space.",23
icra,None,Optimal fault-tolerant Jacobian matrix generators for redundant manipulators,"Hamid Abdi,Saeid Nahavandi,Anthony A. Maciejewski,","The design of locally optimal fault-tolerant manipulators has been previously addressed via adding constraints on the bases of a desired null space to the design constraints of the manipulators. Then by algebraic or numeric solution of the design equations, the optimal Jacobian matrix is obtained. In this study, an optimal fault-tolerant Jacobian matrix generator is introduced from geometric properties instead of the null space properties. The proposed generator provides equally fault-tolerant Jacobian matrices in R 3 that are optimally fault tolerant for one or two locked joint failures. It is shown that the proposed optimal Jacobian matrices are directly obtained via regular pyramids. The geometric approach and zonotopes are used as a novel tool for determining relative manipulability in the context of fault-tolerant robotics and for bringing geometric insight into the design of optimal fault-tolerant manipulators.",9
icra,None,The DLR Robot Motion Simulator Part I: Design and setup,"Tobias Bellmann,Johann Heindl,Matthias Hellerer,Richard Kuchar,,,","In recent years a new generation of motion simulators, based on serial kinematics industrial robots, emerged as alternative to the currently prevalent Steward-platforms. This paper presents the newest addition to this: The DLR Robot Motion Simulator. Part I covers the design process and gives a detailed introduction of the setup. The overall layout of the simulation platform and its parts is introduced. To meet the requirements of an interactive simulation, a new piloting cell had to be designed using light-weight construction and real time vehicle simulations were required. Another key issue of the whole design is the guarantee of safety. The simulator utilizes a 10m linear axis to increase its workspace to provide a better simulation experience compared to previous designs of motion simulators with serial or parallel kinematics. Part II introduces a new path planning algorithm for the kinematically redundant simulator platform, required for the generation of appropriate motion cues. Furthermore the application artistic-flight simulation is demonstrated and validated.",49
icra,None,The DLR Robot Motion Simulator Part II: Optimization based path-planning,"Tobias Bellmann,Martin Otter,Gerd Hirzinger,","In Part I of this paper, a novel motion simulator platform is presented, the DLR Robot Motion Simulator with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF). In this Part II, a path-planning algorithm for mentioned platform will be discussed. By replacing the widely used hexapod kinematics by an antropomorhic, industrial robot arm mounted on a standard linear axis, a comparably larger workspace at lower hardware costs can be achieved. But the serial, redundant kinematics of the industrial robot system also introduces challenges for the path-planning as singularities in the workspace, varying movability of the system and the handling of robot system's kinematical redundancy. By solving an optimization problem with constraints in every sampling step, a feasible trajectory can be generated, fulfilling the task of motion cueing, while respecting the robot's dynamic constraints.",24
icra,None,Examples of planar robot kinematic designs from optimally fault-tolerant Jacobians,"Khaled M. Ben-Gharbia,Rodney G. Roberts,Anthony A. Maciejewski,","It is common practice to design a robot's kinematics from the desired properties that are locally specified by a manipulator Jacobian. It has been recently shown that multiple different physical robot kinematic designs can be obtained from (essentially) a single Jacobian that has desirable fault tolerant properties. Fault tolerance in this case is defined as the post-failure Jacobian possessing the largest possible minimum singular value over all possible locked-joint failures. In this work, a mathematical analysis that describes the number of possible planar robot designs for optimally fault-tolerant Jacobians is presented. Two examples, one that is optimal to a single joint failure and the second that is optimal to two joint failures, are discussed. The paper concludes by illustrating some of the large variability in the global kinematic properties of these designs, despite being generated from the same Jacobian.",13
icra,None,Experimental comparison of Bounded-Error State Estimation and Constraints Propagation,"Bastien Vincke,Alain Lambert,","The vehicle's localization is classically achieved by Bayesian methods like Extended Kalman Filtering. Such methods provide an estimated position with its associated uncertainty. Bounded-error approaches (Bounded-Error State Estimation and Constraints Propagation) use interval analysis and work in a different way as they provide a possible set of positions. An advantage of bounded-error approaches over Bayesian methods is that their results are guaranteed (whereas the results of Bayesian methods are probabilistically defined). This paper compares both Bounded-Error State Estimation and Constraints Propagation using the same experimental data. The results obtained aim to rank these approaches in terms of computing time, consistency and imprecision.",13
icra,None,6DOF pose estimation using 3D sensors,"Bart Verzijlenberg,Michael Jenkin,","Pose estimation is an important capability for mobile agents. A wide variety of solutions have been proposed, but work in the literature has focused primarily on solutions for robots whose mobility is restricted to the ground plane. In this work we present a framework for 6DOF pose estimation. Normally the increased computational cost associated with this higher dimensional space makes pose estimation intractable. The approach presented here addresses the computational issues associated with the higher dimensional problem by decoupling orientation estimation from position estimation. Assuming that orientation can be estimated separately from position allows efficient methods to be used for the (unimodal) orientation estimate, while more sophisticated methods are used for the position estimate. Although similar to Rao-Blackwellization, the approach is essentially reversed. Results on real and simulated datasets and a comparison with a naive 6DOF filter are presented.",1
icra,None,Determining the robot-to-robot 3D relative pose using combinations of range and bearing measurements (Part II),"Xun S. Zhou,Stergios I. Roumeliotis,","In this paper, we address the problem of motion induced 3D robot-to-robot extrinsic calibration based on different combinations of inter-robot measurements (i.e., distance and/or bearing observations) and ego-motion estimates, recorded across multiple time steps. In particular, we focus on solving minimal problems where the unknown 6-degree of-freedom transformation between two robots is determined based on the minimum number of measurements necessary for finding a discrete set of solutions. In our previous work [1], we have shown that only 14 base systems need to be solved, and provided closed-form solutions for three of them. This paper considers the remaining systems and provides closed-form solutions to most of them, while for some of the most challenging problems, we introduce efficient symbolic-numerical solution methods. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed solvers through extensive simulations.",17
icra,None,Near-optimal landmark selection for mobile robot navigation,"Maximilian Beinhofer,Jörg Müller,Wolfram Burgard,","The ability to accurately localize themselves is a fundamental pre-condition for service robots designed to carry out navigation and transportation tasks. Because of the high degree of dynamics in populated and real-world environments, often artificial landmarks are used to achieve the desired accuracy in localization. In this paper we consider the problem of optimally placing landmarks for robots navigating frequently on similar trajectories. Our method maximizes conditional mutual information of the states of the robot given the landmark observations. It uses a greedy algorithm which approximates the solution of the NP-hard maximization problem. For this algorithm, we derive a tight constant-factor bound on the approximation error. We furthermore evaluate the selected landmark sets in extensive experiments carried out both in simulation and with a real robot.",30

In particular, the friction effects acting at joint level have been rendered by means of a LuGre-like model and a procedure for the identification of the friction model parameters is described. With the aim of providing an online estimation of the effects due to the interaction of the robotic hand with the environment, a controller able to evaluate the overall external torque acting on the finger joints and to discern between friction and torques generated by the external interaction force without using direct measures of the contact forces is proposed. The identification and control tests are carried over on an experimental setup composed by a single finger phalanx, manufactured with the same material and techniques of the hand itself.",17
icra,None,Green strain based FE modeling of rheological objects for handling large deformation and rotation,"Zhongkui Wang,Shinichi Hirai,","Rheological object, such as clay, various food products, biological organs and tissues, has both elastic and plastic properties. Modeling of such objects has not been studied intensively comparing with elastic objects. Previous rheological models were mostly based on linear constitutive law of stress and strain, which is limited to small deformation. In this paper, finite element (FE) model of rheological objects based on linear Cauchy strain tensor was summarized at first. Nonlinear FE model formulated with Green strain tensor was then presented for simulating large deformation and deformation with rotation motion. Instead of constant and symmetrical connection matrices in the linear model, nonlinear model yields non-constant and unsymmetrical connection matrices, which vary with displacements of nodal points. Simulation results with both linear and nonlinear FE models were presented to show the differences. We found that the nonlinear model formulated with Green strain tensor demonstrates more natural simulation behaviors.",6
icra,None,Going beyond the perception of affordances: Learning how to actualize them through behavioral parameters,"Emre Ugur,Erhan Oztop,Erol Şahin,","In this paper, we propose a method that enables a robot to learn not only the existence of affordances provided by objects, but also the behavioral parameters required to actualize them, and the prediction of effects generated on the objects in an unsupervised way. In a previous study, it was shown that through self-interaction and self-observation, analogous to an infant, an anthropomorphic robot can learn object affordances in a completely unsupervised way, and use this knowledge to make plans in its perceptual space. This paper extends the affordances model proposed in that study by using parametric behaviors and including the behavior parameters into affordance learning and goal-oriented plan generation. Furthermore, for handling complex behaviors and complex objects (such as execution of precision grasp on a mug), the perceptual processing is improved by using a combination of local and global features. Finally, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to discover the affordances in non-homogenous feature space. In short, object affordances for object manipulation are discovered together with behavior parameters based on the monitored effects.",18
icra,None,Measurement crosstalk elimination of torque encoder using selectively compliant suspension,"Hiroshi Kaminaga,Kohei Odanaka,Tomohiro Kawakami,Yoshihiko Nakamura,","Realization of rigid and sensitive torque sensor is one of the key factors for the success of robots. With the conventional detectors as strain gauges, poor S/N (signal to noise) ratio has been the limitation of torque sensor sensitivity. Torque Encoder uses a linear encoder as a detector and significantly enhanced the S/N ratio, and realized stiff and sensitive torque sensor. However, the crosstalk in torque measurement was still an open problem as in other sensing methods. In this paper, we analyzed the cause of the crosstalk and proposed the mechanism to suppress the crosstalk using selectively compliant suspension mechanism. Design methodology, implementation to minimize crosstalk with minimal sensitivity loss are presented. Evaluation on a prototype of the mechanism is carried out to show the effectiveness of the mechanism.",9
icra,None,Graph-based distributed cooperative navigation,"Vadim Indelman,Pini Gurfil,Ehud Rivlin,Hector Rotstein,","This paper addresses the problem of distributed cooperative navigation. A new graph-based method is developed for on-demand calculation of the required correlation terms, considering a general multi-robot measurement model. These correlation terms are necessary for the consistent EKF-based data fusion when several statistically-dependent sources of information are used. The measurement model relates between the navigation information transmitted by any number of robots and the actual readings taken by the available onboard sensors. The transmitted information is not necessarily of the current time instant, but may actually belong to some time instant from the past. Experiment results and a theoretical example of the developed method are presented considering a three-view measurement, formulated upon receiving three images of the same scene, captured by different robots at different a priori unknown time instances.",8

This paper presents an initial investigation into this question. A method is developed which can be used to classify the behavior of other team members, and provide a measure of how similar their behavior is to the expected behavior. A simulation and a real-world experiment are presented, and results show that expected and traitorous behavior are distinguishable in an example real world setting. I.",0

A distributed reconfiguration strategy is pro posed for each module to achieve the objective. The strategy guarantees that the system successfully evolves without collisions despite of the absence of centralized planning and global information exchange. The correctness of the algorithm is verified theoretically. An upper-bound of converging time based on the proposed algorithm is provided as well. Simulations well validate the results we obtain.,15
icra,None,EKF monocular SLAM with relocalization for laparoscopic sequences,"Oscar G. Grasa,Javier Civera,J. M. M. Montiel,","In recent years, research on visual SLAM has produced robust algorithms providing, in real time at 30 Hz, both the 3D model of the observed rigid scene and the 3D camera motion using as only input the gathered image sequence. These algorithms have been extensively validated in rigid human-made environments -indoor and outdoor- showing robust performance in dealing with clutter, occlusions or sudden motions. Medical endoscopic sequences naturally pose a monocular SLAM problem: an unknown camera motion in an unknown environment. The corresponding map would be useful in providing 3D information to assist surgeons, to support augmented reality insertions or to be exploited by medical robots. In this paper we propose the combination EKF Monocular SLAM + 1-Point RANSAC + Randomised List Relocalization to process laparoscopic sequences -abdominal cavity images-. The sequences are challenging due to: 1) cluttering produced by tools; 2) sudden motions of the camera; 3) laparoscope frequently goes in and out of abdominal cavity; 4) tissue deformation caused by respiration, heartbeats and/or surgical tools. Real medical image sequences provide experimental validation.",88

However, many of the catheters used in these procedures exhibit non-linear behavior, and thus present many difficulties in implementing effective open-loop control. Systems such as this have been shown to benefit from closed-loop control, however very little investigation has been done into 3D closed loop control of this class of manipulators.

Iordachita,Peter Guion,,,","Recently several systems for magnetic resonance image (MRI) guided needle placement in the prostate have been reported. In comparison to conventional ultrasound-guided needle placement in the prostate, these MRI-guided systems promise improved targeting accuracy for prostate intervention procedures including biopsy, fiducial marker insertion, injection and focal therapy. In MRI-guided needle interventions, after a needle is inserted, the needle position is often confirmed with a volumetric MRI scan. Commonly used titanium needles are not directly visible in an MR image, but they generate a susceptibility artifact in the immediate neighborhood of the needle. This paper reports the results of a quantitative study of the relation between the true position of titanium biopsy needle and the corresponding needle artifact position in MR images. The titanium needle artifact was found to be displaced 0.38 mm and 0.32 mm shift in scanner's frequency and phase encoding direction, respectively. The artifact at the tip of the titanium needle was observed to bend toward the scanner's B 0 magnetic field direction.",11

icra,None,A visual language model for estimating object pose and structure in a generative visual domain,"Siddharth Narayanaswamy,Andrei Barbu,Jeffrey Mark Siskind,","We present a generative domain of visual objects by analogy to the generative nature of human language. Just as small inventories of phonemes and words combine in a grammatical fashion to yield myriad valid words and utterances, a small inventory of physical parts combine in a grammatical fashion to yield myriad valid assemblies. We apply the notion of a language model from speech recognition to this visual domain to similarly improve the performance of the recognition process over what would be possible by only applying recognizers to the components. Unlike the context-free models for human language, our visual language models are context sensitive and formulated as stochastic constraint-satisfaction problems. And unlike the situation for human language where all components are observable, our methods deal with occlusion, successfully recovering object structure despite unobservable components. We demonstrate our system with an integrated robotic system for disassembling structures that performs whole-scene reconstruction consistent with a language model in the presence of noisy feature detectors.",9
icra,None,Parametrized shape models for clothing,"Stephen Miller,Mario Fritz,Trevor Darrell,Pieter Abbeel,","We consider the problem of recognizing the configuration of clothing articles when crudely spread out on a flat surface, prior to and during folding. At the core of our approach are parametrized shape models for clothing articles. Each clothing category has its own shape model, and the variety in shapes for a given category is achieved through variation of the parameters. We present an efficient algorithm to find the parameters that provide the best fit when given an image of a clothing article. The models are such that, once the parameters have been fit, they provide a basic parse of the clothing article, allowing it to be followed by autonomous folding from category level specifications of fold sequences. Our approach is also able to recover the configuration of a clothing article when folds are being introduced-an important feature towards closing the perception-action loop. Additionally, our approach provides a reliable method of shape-based classification, simply by examining which model yields the best fit. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large set of clothing articles. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end system, which starts from an unknown spread-out clothing article, performs a parametrized model fit, then follows a category-level (rather than article specific) set of folding instructions, closing the loop with perceptual feedback by re-fitting between folds.",106
icra,None,A surface-based Next-Best-View approach for automated 3D model completion of unknown objects,"Simon Kriegel,Tim Bodenmüller,Michael Suppa,Gerd Hirzinger,","The procedure of manually generating a 3D model of an object is very time consuming for a human operator. Next best-view (NBV) planning is an important aspect for automation of this procedure in a robotic environment. We propose a surface-based NBV approach, which creates a triangle surface from a real-time data stream and determines viewpoints similar to human intuition. Thereby, the boundaries in the surface are detected and a quadratic patch for each boundary is estimated. Then several viewpoint candidates are calculated, which look perpendicular to the surface and overlap with previous sensor data. A NBV is selected with the goal to fill areas which are occluded. This approach focuses on the completion of a 3D model of an unknown object. Thereby, the search space for the viewpoints is not restricted to a cylinder or sphere. Our NBV determination proves to be very fast, and is evaluated in an experiment on test objects, applying an industrial robot and a laser range scanner.",57

icra,None,A smooth control law for graceful motion of differential wheeled mobile robots in 2D environment,"Jong Jin Park,Benjamin Kuipers,","Although recent progress in 2D mobile robot navigation has been significant, the great majority of existing work focuses only on ensuring that the robot reaches its goal. But to make autonomous navigation truly successful, the “quality” of planned motion is important as well. Here, we develop and analyze a pose-following kinematic control law applicable to unicycle-type robots, such that the robot can generate intuitive, fast, smooth, and comfortable trajectories. The Lyapunov-based feedback control law is derived via singular perturbation. It is made up of three components: (i) egocentric polar coordinates with respect to an observer on the vehicle, (ii) a slow subsystem which describes the position of the vehicle, where the reference heading is obtained via state feedback, and (iii) a fast subsystem which describes the steering of the vehicle, where the vehicle heading is exponentially stabilized to the obtained reference heading. The resulting path is a smooth and intuitive curve, globally converging to an arbitrary target pose without singularities, from any given initial pose. Furthermore, we present a simple path following strategy based on the proposed control law to satisfy arbitrary velocity, acceleration and jerk bounds imposed by the user. Such requirements are important to any autonomous vehicle so as to avoid actuator overload and to make the path physically realizable, and they are critical for applications like autonomous wheelchairs where passengers can be physically fragile.",80
icra,None,General dynamic formations for non-holonomic systems along planar curvilinear coordinates,"Athanasios Krontiris,Sushil Louis,Kostas E. Bekris,","This paper describes a general geometric method for planar formations of non-holonomic systems. The approach directly provides the feasible controls that each individual robot has to execute in order for the team to maintain the formation based on the controls of a reference agent, either a real leader-robot or a virtual one. In order to directly satisfy the non-holonomic constraints, the geometric reasoning takes place in curvilinear coordinates, defined by the curvature of the reference trajectory, instead of the typical rectilinear coordinates. The generality of the approach lies on the ability to define dynamic formations so as to smoothly switch between static ones, where the robots can change both of their relative coordinates as they move, and the ability to acquire a desired formation given an initial random configuration. Furthermore, it is possible to correct errors in the achieved configuration of the vehicles on the fly. Simulated experiments are presented to verify the correctness of the provided derivations.",3
icra,None,An investigation into improved non-contact adhesion mechanism suitable for wall climbing robotic applications,"Matthew Journee,XiaoQi Chen,James Robertson,Mark Jermy,Mathieu Sellier,","Pneumatic, non-contact end effectors for robotic pick-and-place applications use compressed air to provide an adhesion force based on the Bernoulli principle, which creates a low pressure region near the surface of the end effector. However, consideration of the influence of the Bernoulli principle alone gives an inadequate account of the performance of some end effector designs. In fact, end effector geometry can be constructed in such a way that the Bernoulli principle provides only a small contribution to the overall adhesion force. This paper investigates the role of viscous flow entrainment in improving adhesion efficiency. Both simulation and experimental results show a significant improvement of adhesion force by nearly five times over a commercially available Bernoulli gripper, which makes the improved adhesion mechanism suitable for more demanding wall climbing robotic applications.",15

Specifically, a procedure that alters the mechanical design of a robot arm to incorporate springs optimized to reduce the maximum motor torque, or energy, required to perform a specified maneuver is proposed. By reducing the maximum motor torque required, the reliability and utility of the motors (and by extension the entire UGV) are increased. Our joint model includes both a non-backdrivable worm gear and a static DC motor. Initial results for a one link arm indicate that this procedure can reduce maximum required torque by 50.9% and energy consumed by 8.5%.",20

Contrarily to Stewart platforms, an industrial manipulator offers several advantages when used as motion simulator: larger motion envelope, higher dexterity, and possibility to realize any end-effector posture within the workspace. In addition to this, the new actuated cabin acts as an additional joint and provides the needed kinematic redundancy to cope with the robot actuator and joint range constraints, which in general can significantly deteriorate the desired motion cues the robot is reproducing. In particular, we will show that, by suitably exploiting the redundancy better results can be obtained in reproducing sustained acceleration cues, a relevant problem when implementing vehicle simulators.",10

In many cases, the use of multiple robots can greatly improve the performance of these tasks. We assume a prior map is available, but it may be inaccurate due to factors such as occlusion, age, dynamic objects, and resolution limitations. In this work, we address the NP-hard problem of environmental coverage with incomplete prior map information using k robots. To utilize related algorithms in graph theory, we represent the environment as a graph and model the coverage problem as a k-Rural Postman Problem. Using this representation, we present a graph coverage approach for plan generation that can handle graph changes online. Our approach proposes two improvements to an existing heuristic algorithm for the coverage problem. Our improvements seek to equalize the length of the k paths by minimizing the length of the maximum tour. We evaluate our approach on a set of comparison tests in simulation.",18
icra,None,Decentralized path planning for multi-agent teams in complex environments using rapidly-exploring random trees,"Vishnu R. Desaraju,Jonathan P. How,","This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of planning paths for multi-agent systems operating in complex environments. The algorithm developed, Decentralized Multi-Agent Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (DMA-RRT), is an extension of the Closed-loop RRT (CL-RRT) algorithm to the multi-agent case, retaining its ability to plan quickly even with complex constraints. Moreover, a merit-based token passing coordination strategy is developed to dynamically update the planning order based on a measure of each agent's incentive to replan, derived from the CL-RRT. Agents with a greater incentive plan sooner, yielding a greater reduction of the global cost and greater improvement in the team's overall performance. An extended version of the algorithm, Cooperative DMA-RRT, allows agents to modify others' plans in order to select paths that reduce their combined cost and thus further improve global performance. The paths generated by both algorithms are proven to satisfy inter-agent constraints, such as collision avoidance, and a set of simulation and experimental results verify performance.",70
icra,None,Classifying the Heterogeneous Multi-Robot online search problem into quadratic time competitive complexity class,"Shahar Sarid,Amir Shapiro,Elon Rimon,Yael Edan,","We explore the problem where a group of robots with different velocities search for a target in an unbounded unknown environment. The target position is un known, hence, an online search algorithm is developed. The H-MRSTM algorithm (Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Search Time Multiplication), launches a group of n robots from a common starting location to search for the target. The robots are assigned to search inside a series of concentric discs with increasing radii. Each robot is assigned to search inside a disc and when completing the search inside this disc without finding the target, the robot is assigned to search in the next unoccupied disc. We prove that every algorithm that solves this search problem must have at least a quadratic time competitive complexity and prove that the H-MRSTM algorithm's complexity is also quadratic. Hence, we obtain both an upper and lower bound on the time competitive complexity of the search problem. Consequently, H-MRSTM is proved to be optimal. Simulations in various environments show that the average case performance of H-MRSTM is superior to that of homogeneous multi-robot and single robot algorithms. In depth simulation analyses evaluated the effect of several other parameters such as the initial disc search time, the distribution of the velocities, the number of robots and the position of the target.",0
icra,None,Tangent space RRT: A randomized planning algorithm on constraint manifolds,"Chansu Suh,Terry Taewoong Um,Beobkyoon Kim,Hakjong Noh,,,","Motion planning for robots subject to holonomic constraints typically involves planning on constraint manifolds. In this paper we present the Tangent Space Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (TS-RRT) algorithm for planning on constraint manifolds. The key idea is to construct random trees not on the constraint manifold itself, but rather on tangent space approximations to the constraint manifold. Curvature-based methods are developed for constructing bounded tangent space approximations, as well as procedures for random node generation and bidirectional tree extension. Extensive numerical experiments suggest that the TS-RRT algorithm, despite its increased preprocessing and bookkeeping, outperforms existing constrained planning algorithms for a wide range of benchmark planning problems.",33
icra,None,Story validation and approximate path inference with a sparse network of heterogeneous sensors,"Jingjin Yu,Steven M. LaValle,","Given a story from an agent (sensor outputs from a robot or a tale told by a human) and recordings from a spare network of heterogeneous sensors, this paper provides efficient algorithms that validate whether it is possible to reconstruct a path compatible with the sensor recordings that is also ""close"" to the agent's story. In solving the proposed problems, we show that effective exploitation of a unique finite automaton structure yields time complexity linear in both the length of the story and the length of the sensor observation history. Besides immediate applicability towards security and forensics problems, the idea of behavior validation using external sensors also appears promising in complementing design time model verification.",17
icra,None,Monocular depth from focus estimation with complementary filters,"Tiago Gaspar,Paulo Oliveira,","In this paper, new methodologies for the estimation of the depth of a target with unknown dimensions, based on depth from focus strategies, are proposed. The image-based measurements are detailed, through the minimization of a new functional, deeply rooted on optical characteristics of the lens system, namely the point spread function. This work complements an inexpensive single pan and tilt camera-based indoor positioning and tracking system, resorting to complementary filters for depth estimation. A motivation example is provided, where the target dimensions are assumed as known. Then, an extension corresponding to an higher-order filter is presented, that tackles the problem at hand. To assess the performance of the proposed system, a series of indoor experimental tests for a range of operation of up to ten meter were carried out. A centimetric accuracy was obtained under realistic conditions.",3
icra,None,Initialization of the Kalman filter without assumptions on the initial state,"Magnus Linderoth,Kristian Soltesz,Anders Robertsson,Rolf Johansson,","In absence of covariance data, Kalman filters are usually initialized by guessing the initial state. Making the variance of the initial state estimate large makes sure that the estimate converges quickly and that the influence of the initial guess soon will be negligible. If, however, only very few measurements are available during the estimation process and an estimate is wanted as soon as possible, this might not be enough. This paper presents a method to initialize the Kalman filter without any knowledge about the distribution of the initial state and without making any guesses.",26
icra,None,Bearing-only target tracking using a bank of MAP estimators,"Guoquan P. Huang,Ke X. Zhou,Nikolas Trawny,Stergios I. Roumeliotis,","Nonlinear estimation problems, such as bearing-only tracking, are often addressed using linearized estimators, e.g., the extended Kalman filter (EKF). These estimators generally suffer from linearization errors as well as the inability to track multimodal probability density functions (pdfs). In this paper, we propose a bank of batch maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators as a general estimation framework that provides relinearization of the entire state history, multi-hypothesis tracking, and an efficient hypothesis generation scheme. Each estimator in the bank is initialized using a locally optimal state estimate for the current time step. Every time a new measurement becomes available, we convert the nonlinear cost function corresponding to this relaxed one-step subproblem into polynomial form, allowing to analytically and efficiently compute all stationary points. This local optimization generates highly probable hypotheses for the target trajectory and greatly improves the quality of the overall MAP estimate. Additionally, pruning and marginalization are employed to control the computational cost. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the EKF, the standard batch MAP estimator, and the particle filter (PF), in terms of accuracy and consistency.",7

Akin Sisbot,Léonard Jaillet,Juan Cortés,Rachid Alami,,",This paper addresses the motion planning problem while considering Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) constraints. The proposed planner generates collision-free paths that are acceptable and legible to the human. The method extends our previous work on human-aware path planning to cluttered environments. A randomized cost-based exploration method provides an initial path that is relevant with respect to HRI and workspace constraints. The quality of the path is further improved with a local path-optimization method. Simulation results on mobile manipulators in the presence of humans demonstrate the overall efficacy of the approach.,142
icra,None,A framework for preoperative planning of robotics-assisted minimally invasive cardiac surgery (RAMICS) under geometric uncertainty,"Hamidreza Azimian,Rajni V. Patel,Michael D. Naish,Bob Kiaii,","In this paper, robust preoperative planning of RAMICS is formulated. The intent of the proposed planning framework is to improve surgical outcomes by contemplating the intraoperative conditions of the surgical procedure and the geometry of the patient's thoracic anatomy. This includes improvements in target reachability, instrument dexterity for critical surgical tasks, surgical task feasibility and visibility. Given the patient's preoperative computed tomography images of the chest, the planning framework aims to determine the optimal location of the access ports on the ribcage, along with the optimal pose of the robotic arms relative to the patient's anatomy. To minimize susceptibility of the results to intraoperative geometric uncertainty, the planning is formulated as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Program (GSIP) with a convex lower level problem and a multi-criteria objective function. By solving the GSIP, tolerable geometric uncertainty within the task space is increased by eliminating the likelihood of collisions and joint limit violation in a neighborhood of the surgical target.",6
icra,None,Partial closure grasps: Metrics and computation,"Heinrich Kruger,A. Frank van der Stappen,","We extend the notion of grasp metrics to partial force-closure grasps. We describe two metrics which measure the maximum and sum, respectively, of the forces that need to be applied at the contacts involved in a grasp, in order to exert some given unit wrench on the grasped object. For a given object P of complexity O(n) and a pure force T, we describe efficient algorithms which compute all combinations of m features (edges of polygons or facets of polyhedra) that admit grasps capable of exerting T such that the value of our metric is greater than some threshold. In particular, we show that if P is a polygon, all pairs of edges that admit frictionless two-finger grasps capable of exerting T can be computed in O(n log 2 n+K) time, where K is the number of pairs of edges in the output. Also, all two-finger grasps with friction of a polyhedral object can be computed in O(n 3/2+ε + K') time and all frictionless three-finger grasps of a polyhedron can be computed in O(n 5/2+ε + K') time, where K 0 is the number of pairs or triples of facets that satisfy some slightly weaker condition and ε is some arbitrarily small, positive constant.",9

In this paper, we develop a system that enables a robot to grasp an object and to move it in front of its depth camera so as to build a 3D surface model of the object. We derive an information gain based variant of the next best view algorithm in order to determine how the manipulator should move the object in front of the camera. By considering occlusions caused by the robot manipulator, our technique also determines when and how the robot should re-grasp the object in order to build a complete model.",165

The requirement to negotiate bends, T-joints and steep inclinations pose another set of strict design constraints. The proposed robot consists of a modular design (7 modules) with a relatively low number of active degrees of freedom. The system is using a novel clamping mechanism with a series-elastic drive. The design of this mechanism has resulted in a high spreading factor allowing the system to operate in a wide diameter range (63 mm to 125 mm outer diameter). In this paper the mechanical design requirements and control system will be discussed. Preliminary test results will be given.",100

The passive wheel can be transformed into sole mode by rotating ankle roll joint when Roller-Walker walks on rough terrain. This paper discusses energy efficiency of locomotion in wheeled mode. We define a leg trajectory to produce forward straight propulsion and discuss the relationships between the parameters of the leg trajectory and energy efficiency of the propulsion using numerical simulator. We find optimum parameter sets where optimization criteria is specific resistance. Then we carried out hardware experiments and empirically derived experimental specific resistance. We show that wheeled locomotion has 8 times higher energy efficiency than ordinary crawl gait. Finally we compare the specific resistance of Roller-Walker with other walking robots described in the literatures.,33

In this research, we propose a hybrid mechanism of a wheeground a paddle as drive mechanism itself to realize an effective movement on the border such as a coast with debris after a disaster like a seismic sea wave or a tanker grounding accident.

As motivation for this interesting form of locomotion we provide a geometric analysis of a vertical step climbing task, one that tumbling robots perform well with respect to their size and complexity. In addition to our analysis we present results of a hardware experiment with a tumbling robot performing the task for varying combinations of frictional coefficients at the step and ground.",10
icra,None,A novel mechanism for varying stiffness via changing transmission angle,"Hung Vu Quy,Lijin Aryananda,Farrukh Iqbal Sheikh,Flurin Casanova,,","Compliant actuation contributes enormously in legged locomotion robotics since it is able to alleviate control efforts in improving the robot's adaptability and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel design of a variable stiffness rotary actuator, called MESTRAN, which was especially targeted to address the limitations in terms of the amount of energy and time required to vary the stiffness of an actuated joint. We have constructed a mechanical model in simulation and a physical prototype. We conducted a series of experiments to validate the performance of the MESTRAN actuator prototype. The results from the simulation and experiments show that MESTRAN allows independent control of stiffness and position of an actuated rotary joint with a large operational range and high speed. The torque-displacement relationship is close to linear. Lastly, the MESTRAN actuator is energy-efficient since a certain stiffness level is maintained without energy input.",48
icra,None,The DLR FSJ: Energy based design of a variable stiffness joint,"Sebastian Wolf,Oliver Eiberger,Gerd Hirzinger,","Bringing mechanically compliant joints to robots is in the focus of interest world wide, especially in the humanoid robotics community. Variable Stiffness Joints (VSJ) promise to gain a high performing and robust robotic system. The presented DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ) is a VSJ module designed for the first 4 axes of the anthropomorphic DLR Hand Arm System. The DLR Hand Arm System aims to match the skills of its natural archetype. For this purpose, the joints have to be extremely compact to fit into the arm. At the same time they require a high power density in order to approximate the human arm skills. The new DLR FSJ is designed completely from an energy based point of view. This addresses not only energy efficient components and low friction design, but also that the potential energy of the spring is used as good as possible. A demonstration of robustness is given by the investigation of a blunt impact to the tip of the arm.",248

This approach was scarcely covered in past literature. Many recent works introduced a large number of actuators with adjustable stiffness, optimized for a wide set of applications. They cover a broad range of design possibilities, but their availability is still limited to small quantities. This work presents the design and implementation of a modular servo-VSA multi-unit system, called VSA-CubeBot. It offers a customizable platform for the realization and test of variable stiffness robotic structures with many degrees of freedom. We present solutions relative to the variable stiffness mechanism, embedded electronics, mechanical and electrical interconnections.

In this paper, we address the problem of designing a two degree of freedom metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of an index finger. The artificial MCP joint is composed of a ball joint, crocheted ligaments, and a silicon rubber sleeve which as a whole provides the functions required of a human finger joint. We quantitatively validate the efficacy of the artificial joint by comparing its dynamic characteristics with that of two human subjects' index fingers by analyzing their impulse response with linear regression. Design parameters of the artificial joint are varied to highlight their effect on the joint's dynamics. A modified, second-order model is fit which accounts for non-linear stiffness and damping, and a higher order model is considered. Good fits are observed both in the human (R 2 = 0.97) and the artificial joint of the index finger (R 2 = 0.95). Parameter estimates of stiffness and damping for the artificial joint are found to be similar to those in the literature, indicating our new joint is a good approximation for an index finger's MCP joint.",46

While intrinsic neutral buoyancy of a microrobot per se simplifies propulsion in the liquid environments, softness makes it compliant with delicate environments, such as the human body, thus guaranteeing a safe interaction with soft structures. With this aim, two groups of soft microrobots with paramagnetic and ferromagnetic behaviors were designed, fabricated and their features were experimentally analyzed. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, in the performed trials the ferromagnetic microrobots showed orientation capabilities in response to the magnetic field that could not be achieved by the paramagnetic one. Moreover, it was observed that the ferromagnetic microrobot could reach higher speed values (maximum value of 0.73 body length/s) than the paramagnetic prototype.",19

Voyles,","Structured Computational Polymers (SCP) is a concept of layered class of active material that can sense its environment and, due to its cognitive capabilities, react “intelligently” to those changes. In such a material, we envision semiconducting polymer based sensing, actuation, and information processing for on-board decision making to be combined into one active material. This paper describes incremental steps taken towards developing such a multifunctional active material, concentrating on distributed forms of actuation and cognition, with an intermediate goal of utilizing SCP as a “skin” of a soft robot - a robot, made of flexible materials, which is not bounded by its rigid structure and can adjust to its changing environment - with its sensing, cognition, and actuation embedded in the shape. We demonstrate, via experiment and rudimentary simulation, the feasibility of utilizing water hammer as a form of directed, distributed actuation. We also show that distributed form of cognition can be realized via a novel concept termed Synthetic Neural Network (SNN), which is a type of organic neuromorphic architecture modeled after Artificial Neural Network. SNN, based on a single-transistor-single-memristor-per-input for an individual neuron, can approximate the sigmoidal activation function with an accuracy of about 3%. A simulation of the SNN is shown to accurately predict the directionality of water hammer propulsion with an accuracy of 7.2 percent.",12
icra,None,Simulation of a soft-bodied fluid-driven amoeboid robot that exploits thixotropic flow,"Takuya Umedachi,Masakazu Akiyama,Atsushi Tero,Akio Ishiguro,","This paper presents a two-dimensional simulation model of an amoeboid robot that exhibits locomotion in a decentralized manner. The significant feature to note is that the model does not control friction between parts of the robot and ground explicitly but exploits passive dynamics of the inner fluid of the robot, i.e., thixotropic flow, in order to generate locomotion. Thixotropy is a very interesting rheological property of a fluid to form a gelled structure over time when not subject to shearing and then to liquefy when agitated, which is observed in protoplasmic streaming of amoeba and plasmodium of true slime mold. Simulation results show that embedding this passive dynamics induces morphological positive feedback mechanism, leading to convection of the inner fluid, which in turn generates locomotion without relying on any hierarchical structure. The results obtained are expected to shed new light on revealing the secret of how decentralized control should be designed.",4

The robot integrates and allows in a single platform to perform research in most of the areas involved in autonomous robotics: navigation, mobile and dual-arm manipulation planning, active compliance and force control strategies, object recognition, scene representation, and semantic perception. AILA has 32 degrees of freedom, including 7-DOF arms, 4-DOF torso, 2-DOF head, and a mobile base equipped with six wheels, each of them with two degrees of freedom. The primary design goal was to achieve a lightweight arm construction with a payload-to-weight ratio greater than one. Besides, an adjustable body should sustain the dual-arm system providing an extended workspace. In addition, mobility is provided by means of a wheel-based mobile base. As a result, AILA's arms can lift 8kg and weigh 5.5kg, thus achieving a payload-to-weight ratio of 1.45.

Chávez,Isela Bonilla,Marco Mendoza,,,,","This paper presents a methodology for precise robot positioning and path tracking, performed by industrial robots over large surfaces of arbitrary size, shape and orientation. The methodology is based on a vision-based, calibration-free robot control method known as camera-space manipulation. The path, defined and stored in a CAD file, is later adapted to the curved, work-surface by using a mapping procedure. When applied to large surfaces, the precision of the positioning and path-tracking maneuvers depends on several factors like the resolution of the cameras per unit physical space and the mapping procedure, which may introduce distortion specially in the case of non-developable surfaces. In order to reduce the influence of camera-resolution, this paper presents two alternatives: the use of multiple cameras and the application of cameras mounted over non-expensive, sensorless pan/tilt units. In the case of the distortion produced by the mapping procedure, the paper discusses several options like a modified geodesic mapping and virtual projection. The proposed techniques were tested multiple times over flat and deformed surfaces, by using a large work-envelope, industrial robot.",9
icra,None,Using artificial landmarks to reduce the ambiguity in the environment of a mobile robot,"Daniel Meyer-Delius,Maximilian Beinhofer,Alexander Kleiner,Wolfram Burgard,","Robust and reliable localization is a fundamental prerequisite for many applications of mobile robots. Although there exist many solutions to the localization problem, structurally symmetrical or featureless environments can prevent different locations from being distinguishable given the data obtained with the robot's sensors. Such ambiguities typically make localization approaches more likely to fail. In this paper, we investigate how artificial landmarks can be utilized to reduce the ambiguity in the environment. We present a practical approach to compute a configuration of indistinguishable landmarks that decreases the overall ambiguity and thus increases the robustness of the localization process. We evaluate our approach in different environments based on real data and in simulation.

Instead, we generate a set of keypoints that incorporates those detected in each image. The position of the robot is estimated using the keypoint sets to match measured positions with a map. We conducted experimental comparisons of HDR and auto-exposure images, and our HDR method showed higher robustness and localization accuracy.",14
icra,None,Indoor localization using particle filter and map-based NLOS ranging model,"Jongdae Jung,Hyun Myung,","User localization is one of the key technologies for mobile robots to successfully interact with humans. Among various localization methods using radio frequency (RF) signals, time of arrival (TOA) based localization is popular since the target coordinates can be directly calculated from the accurate range measurements. In complex indoor environment, however, RF ranging-based localization is quite challenging since the range measurements suffer not only from signal noise but also from signal blockages and reflections. A set of range measurements taken in complex indoor environment verifies that almost all measurements are non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ranges which have striking difference to the line-of-sight (LOS) distances. These NLOS range measurements make severe degradation in the accuracy of trilateration based localizations if used without any compensation. In this paper we propose a particle filter-based localization algorithm which utilizes indoor geometry from a given map to estimate the NLOS signal path and compensates for the range measurements. The algorithm is verified with experiments performed in real indoor environments.",24

icra,None,6-DoF model-based tracking of arbitrarily shaped 3D objects,"Pedram Azad,David Münch,Tamim Asfour,Rüdiger Dillmann,","Image-based 6-DoF pose estimation of arbitrarily shaped 3D objects based on their shape is a rarely studied problem. Most existing image-based methods for pose estimation either exploit textural information in form of local features or, if shape-based, rely on the extraction of straight line segments or other primitives. Straight-forward extensions of 2D approaches are potentially more general, but in practice assume a limited range of possible view angles. The general problem is that a 3D object can potentially produce completely different 2D projections depending on its relative pose to the observing camera. One way to reduce the solution space is to exploit temporal information, i.e. perform tracking. Again, existing model-based tracking approaches rely on relatively simple object geometries. In this paper, we propose a particle filter based tracking approach that can deal with arbitrary shapes and arbitrary or even no texture, i.e. it offers a general solution to the rigid object tracking problem. As our approach can deal with occlusions, it is in particular of interest in the context of goal-directed imitation learning involving the observation of object manipulations. Results of simulation experiments as well as real-world experiments with different object types prove the practical applicability of our approach.",57

We named it ""Approaching Visual Servoing"". A proposed hand & eye-vergence dual control system is used to perform Approaching Visual Servoing, aiming at quick eye-tracking and stable hand servoing and approaching. This idea stems from hammerhead shark whose eyes turn to gaze at the target prey to be suited to triangulation, enhancing the ability to measure precisely the distance to the prey for catching it. This animal's visual tracking includes motion con trol by visual servoing and triangular eye vergence. Moreover, a 3-D pose tracking method that combines ""1-Step GA (genetic algorithm)"" and hand-motion feedforword compensation is proposed. Our approach differs from known tracking methods using optimization based on Taylor expansion, for it allows the proposed method not to be annoyed by how to sneak out of local minima. A convergence in time domain whether the 3-D pose tracking error decrease to zero in a successively input images by video rate , is discussed and verified through Lyapunov method. Both Lyapunouv-stable pose tracking and Approaching Visual Servoing are confirmed by experiments using a 7-link manipulator installed with two mobile cameras.",84

Our insight is that incorporating physics models of object behaviour improves tracking performance in these cases. In particular it allows us to handle tracking in the face of rigid body interactions where there is also occlusion and fast object motion. We show how to incorporate rigid body physics simulation into a particle filter. We present two methods for this based on pose and force noise. The improvements are tested on four videos of a robot pushing an object, and results indicate that our approach performs considerably better than a plain particle filter tracker, with the force noise method producing the best results over the range of test videos.",32

In this work, a shape model-based approach using stereo vision and machine learning for object categorization is introduced. The state-of-the-art features for shape matching and shape retrieval were evaluated and selectively transfered into the visual categorization. Visual sensing from different vantage points allows the reconstruction of 3D mesh models of the objects found in the scene by exploiting knowledge about the environment for model-based segmentation and registration. These reconstructed 3D mesh models were used for shape feature extraction for categorization and provide sufficient information for grasping and manipulation. Finally, the visual categorization was successfully performed with a variety of features and classifiers allowing proper categorization of unknown objects even when object appearance and shape substantially differ from the training set. Experimental evaluation with the humanoid robot ARMAR-IIIa is presented.",18
icra,None,Effects of environmental noise on the accuracy of millimeter sized grippers in cantilever configuration and active stabilisation,"Mokrane Boudaoud,Yassine Haddab,Yann Le Gorrec,Philippe Lutz,",This paper presents a study about the effects of environmental noise on millimeter sized grippers in cantilever configuration. The study is motivated and conducted aiming at assessing the level of accuracy loss when performing micromanipulation/microassembly tasks in noisy environments as well in typical microrobotics laboratories as in industrial locations or operating rooms. Ground motion and acoustic noises within a typical microrobotic laboratory are characterized in the frequency domain and their effects on cantilevers of different lengths are inspected. The relevance of a typical vibration isolation table is evaluated and the effects of low and high acoustic noises are assessed. A modeling of a cantilever with base excitation is thereafter conducted in the state space using finite difference formulation and a stabilization of a disturbed cantilever is obtained at the nanometer level in noisy environments allowing perspectives to high precision micromanipulation tasks in hostile locations.,5

The broad range of applications of this generic algorithm includes legged locomotion planning, whole-body manipulation planning, dexterous manipulation planning, as well as any multi-contact-based motion planning problem that might combine several of these sub-problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our planner through example scenarios taken from the aforementioned classes of problems in virtual environments.",65
icra,None,Dexterous manipulation with underactuated elastic hands,"Lael U. Odhner,Aaron M. Dollar,","In this paper we show that it is possible to design underactuated robot hands capable of performing dexterous manipulation tasks, despite the fact that the motion of an underactuated hand is not fully constrained by its actuators. If a robot has elastic elements at its joints, then the velocity of the actuators can be mapped onto the velocity of the grasped object using elastic averaging. This mapping can be used to compute classical measures of manipulability for an underactuated hand. We also demonstrate that holonomically constrained grasps can be analyzed to determine the manifold of stable object configurations that can be reached from some initial grasp. This is especially useful for planar manipulation operations, such as twisting a knob or precision positioning. A prototype two-fingered planar underactuated hand is introduced, having the ability to stably grasp and manipulate objects within the hand.",107
icra,None,On two-finger grasping of deformable planar objects,"Yan-Bin Jia,Feng Guo,Jiang Tian,","Grasping a deformable object instantaneously requires maintaining equilibrium of its pre- and post-deformed shapes using the same set of forces. This paper studies the type of grasps generated by squeezing a planar object with two fingers. It is shown that the success of such a grasp is independent of the applied forces in the case of small deformation. Numerical algorithms are introduced to compute sets of squeeze grasps with small and large deformations modeled using the finite element method (FEM) based on the linear and nonlinear elasticity theories, respectively.",18
icra,None,Towards integrating task information in skills assessment for dexterous tasks in surgery and simulation,"Amod Jog,Brandon Itkowitz,May Liu,Simon DiMaio,Greg Hager,,,","With the increasing popularity of robotic surgery, several studies in the literature have investigated automatically assessing skill measures based on motion and video data captured from these systems. A range of simulation environments for robotic surgery are now in development. Skill assessment in these environments has so far only focused on evaluating the utility and validity of statistics such as task completion time, and instrument distance measured during a simulated task. We present the first work using motion data from a robotic surgery simulation environment in development for classifying users of varying skills and detecting completion of trainee. Given the standardized environment of the simulator, and the availability of the ground truth, skill measurements and feedback based on task motion hold the promise of effective automated objective assessment. Based on motion data of a simulated manipulation task from 17 users of varying skills, we demonstrate binary classification (proficient vs. trainee) of user skill with 87.5% accuracy. Alternate measures based on instrument pose more relevant in the simulated environment including a new measure of motion efficiency are also presented and evaluated.",29
icra,None,Magnetic Levitation camera robot for endoscopic surgery,"Massimiliano Simi,Gianluca Sardi,Pietro Valdastri,Arianna Menciassi,,","A wired miniature surgical camera robot with a novel Magnetic Levitation System (MLS) was modeled, designed and fabricated. A simple analysis and a theoretical model were developed in order to describe and predict basic behavior for different structural parameters of the system. The robot is composed of two main parts (head and tail) linked by a thin elastic flexible joint. The tail module embeds two magnets for anchoring and manual rough translation. The head module incorporates two motorized donut-shaped magnets and a miniaturized vision system at the tip. The MLS can exploit the external magnetic field to induce a smooth bending of the robotic head, guaranteeing a high span tilt motion of the point of view (0°-80°). The device is 100 mm long and 12.7 mm in diameter. Use of such a robot in single port or standard multiport laparoscopy could enable reduction of number/size of ancillary trocars, and/or increase the number of working devices that can be deployed, thus paving the way for multiple point of view laparoscopy.",37
icra,None,Human-Machine Collaborative surgery using learned models,"Nicolas Padoy,Gregory D. Hager,","In the future of surgery, tele-operated robotic assistants will offer the possibility of performing certain commonly occurring tasks autonomously. Using a natural division of tasks into subtasks, we propose a novel surgical Human-Machine Collaborative (HMC) system in which portions of a surgical task are performed autonomously under complete surgeon's control, and other portions manually. Our system automatically identifies the completion of a manual subtask, seamlessly executes the next automated task, and then returns control back to the surgeon. Our approach is based on learning from demonstration. It uses Hidden Markov Models for the recognition of task completion and temporal curve averaging for learning the executed motions. We demonstrate our approach using a da Vinci tele-surgical robot. We show on two illustrative tasks where such human-machine collaboration is intuitive that automated control improves the usage of the master manipulator workspace. Because such a system does not limit the traditional use of the robot, but merely enhances its capabilities while leaving full control to the surgeon, it provides a safe and acceptable solution for surgical performance enhancement.",107
icra,None,Design of a semi-active knee-ankle prosthesis,"Minerva V. Pillai,H. Kazerooni,Andrew Hurwich,","This paper proposes a design for a knee-ankle prosthesis which ultimately controls two linear hydraulic actuators using a single pump. The design takes advantage of the fact that the knee and ankle never produce large positive powers simultaneously during stair-climbing, and that the ankle produces more positive power than the knee during walking. This makes the prosthesis lighter and smaller. During walking, the ankle joint adds forward propulsive power similar to that of an intact ankle. During stair climbing, the knee joint provides assistance like that of an intact knee. The hydraulic nature of the prosthetic allows it to function in a semi-active mode, where it behaves similar to a microcontroller controlled passive transfemoral prosthesis.",56
icra,None,A two-step approach to see-through bad weather for surveillance video quality enhancement,"Zhen Jia,Hongcheng Wang,Rodrigo Caballero,Ziyou Xiong,Jianwei Zhao,,","Adverse weather conditions such as snow, fog or heavy rain greatly reduce the visual quality of outdoor surveillance videos. Video quality enhancement can improve the visual quality of surveillance videos providing clearer images with more details. Existing work in this area mainly focuses on quality enhancement for high resolution videos or still images, but few algorithms are developed for enhancing surveillance videos, which normally have low resolution, high noise and compression artifacts. In addition, for snow or rain conditions, the image quality of near-filed view is degraded by the obscuration of apparent snowflakes and raindrops, while the quality of far field view is degraded by the obscuration of fog-like snowflakes or raindrops. Very few video quality enhancement algorithms have been developed to handle both problems. In this paper, we propose a novel video quality enhancement algorithm for see-through snow, fog or heavy rain. The proposed algorithm has two major steps: 1. the near-field enhancement algorithm identifies obscuration pixels by snow or rain in the near-field view and removes these pixels as snowflakes or rain drops; different from state-of-the-art methods, the algorithm in this step can detect snowflakes on foreground object and background, and choose different methods to fill in the removed regions. 2. the far-field enhancement algorithm restores the image's contrast information not only to reveal more details in the far-field view but also to enhance the overall image's quality; in this step, the proposed algorithm adaptively enhances the global and local contrast, which is inspired on the human visual system, and accounts for the perceptual sensitivity to noise, compression artifacts, and the texture of image content. From our extensive testing, the proposed approach significantly improves the visual quality of surveillance videos by removing snow/fog/rain effects.",47
icra,None,Robust single view room structure segmentation in Manhattan-like environments from stereo vision,"Sven Olufs,Markus Vincze,","In this paper we propose a novel approach for the robust segmentation of room structure using Manhattan world assumption i.e. the frequently observed dominance of three mutually orthogonal vanishing directions in man-made environments. First, separate histograms are generated for the Cartesian major axis, i.e. X, Y and Z, on stereo data with an arbitrary roll, pitch and yaw rotation. Using the traditional Markov particle filters and minimal entropy as metric on the histograms, we are able to estimate the camera orientation with respect to orthogonal structure. Once the orientation is estimated we extract a hypotheses of the room structure by exploiting 2D histograms using mean shift clustering techniques as rough estimate for a pre-segmentation of voxels i.e. plane orientation and position. We apply superpixel over segmentation on the colour input to achieve a dense segmentation. The over segmentation and pre-segmented voxels are combined using graph-cuts for a not a-priori known number of final plane segments with a α-expansion graph cut variant proposed by Delong et al. with polynomial runtime. We show the robustness of our approach with respect to noise in real world data.",19

However, the free form features of logs, few reliable textural features, large edge extraction errors, and segmentation faults caused by the barks on the surface of the logs present clear challenges for recognition and classification. To solve these problems, robust algorithms able to recognize and estimate poses of a variety of objects even under poor and partial inputs need to be developed. In this paper we focus on the most relevant task of recognizing and estimating postures of a bunch of logs located on the ground with varying orientation and distance. Experiments carried out with the help of a structured light camera demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.",11
icra,None,Daytime water detection based on sky reflections,"Arturo L. Rankin,Larry H. Matthies,Paolo Bellutta,","Robust water detection is a critical perception requirement for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous navigation. This is particularly true in wide-open areas where water can collect in naturally occurring terrain depressions during periods of heavy precipitation and form large water bodies. One of the properties of water useful for detecting it is that its surface acts as a horizontal mirror at large incidence angles. Water bodies can be indirectly detected by detecting reflections of the sky below the horizon in color imagery. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has implemented a water detector based on sky reflections that geometrically locates the pixel in the sky that is reflecting on a candidate water pixel on the ground and predicts if the ground pixel is water based on color similarity and local terrain features. This software detects water bodies in wide-open areas on cross-country terrain at mid- to far-range using imagery acquired from a forward-looking stereo pair of color cameras mounted on a terrestrial UGV. In three test sequences approaching a pond under a clear, overcast, and cloudy sky, the true positive detection rate was 100% when the UGV was beyond 7 meters of the water's leading edge and the largest false positive detection rate was 0.58%. The sky reflection based water detector has been integrated on an experimental unmanned vehicle and field tested at Ft. Indiantown Gap, PA, USA.",56

With respect to conventional solutions for force sensing, like strain-gauge or Bragg-grating based force sensors, this sensor presents several advantages, mainly in terms of compactness, simplicity of the implementation and conditioning electronics. The proposed sensor exploits the properties of optoelectronic components with a narrow angle of view to measure the very small deformation of a compliant frame caused by the tendon tension. The sensor can be placed at the tendon ends as such as in any position along the tendon.

This mechanism enhances the range of feasible grasps of the underactuated hand without significantly increasing its complexity. Two architectures are investigated: one is purely planar while the other uses a spherical mechanism in conjunction with a planar linkage. The analysis of the planar mechanism between the index finger and the third finger is first assessed, in which the parameters are determined in order to satisfy the constraints on the motion ranges while minimizing the coordination error. Then, the study of the mechanism joining the third finger and the little finger is summarized, followed by the analysis of the spherical mechanism. Finally, prototypes of the fingers' abduction systems using the two proposed architectures are presented.",9
icra,None,A miniature load cell suitable for mounting on the phalanges of human-sized robot fingers,"Robert Platt,Chris Ihrke,Lyndon Bridgewater,Douglas Linn,Ron Diftler,,,,","It is frequently accepted that tactile sensing must play a key role in robust manipulation and assembly. The potential exists to complement the gross shape information that vision or range sensors can provide with fine-scale information about the texture, stiffness, and shape of the object grasped. Nevertheless, no widely accepted tactile sensing technology currently exists for robot hands. Furthermore, while several proposals exist in the robotics literature regarding how to use tactile sensors to improve manipulation, there is little consensus. This paper describes the electro-mechanical design of the Robonaut 2 phalange load cell. This is a miniature load cell suitable for mounting on the phalanges of humanoid robot fingers. The important design characteristics of these load cells are the shape of the load cell spring element and the routing of small-gauge wires from the sensor onto a circuit board. The paper reports results from a stress analysis of the spring element and establishes the theoretical sensitivity of the device to loads in different directions. The paper also compares calibrated load cell data to ground truth load measurements for four different manufactured sensors. Finally, the paper analyzes the response of the load cells in the context of a flexible materials localization task.",9
icra,None,Task-specific demonstration and practiced synergies for writing with the ACT hand,"Eric Rombokas,Mark Malhotra,Yoky Matsuoka,","Muscle synergies are hypothesized as a way to reduce the control space of redundant biological neuromuscular control. Robotics researchers are starting to use grasping synergies to simplify the task of coordinating many joints for complex manipulators. This is especially useful for hand movement control as there are many joints and muscles to control to achieve even simple tasks. This paper uses the Anatomically Correct Testbed (ACT) Robotic Hand to understand how task-specific synergies may be formed and used for complex robotic manipulation tasks such as writing. A comparison is made between synergies formed from (1) general hand movements, (2) task-specific demonstration of generic writing, and (3) practice of writing a specific letter. Results showed that performance using task specific demonstration synergies outperforms performance using general-purpose synergies in terms of completion time, energy expenditure, and trajectory error. Performance using practiced synergy outperforms the performance using demonstration synergies in trajectory error, even though there was no statistical difference in completion time and energy expenditure. These results indicate that task specific synergies from demonstration and practice allow a robotic hand to write better than using more generic synergies that may work for other tasks. How general/specific these synergies should be to optimize the performance of different complex tasks without learning too many specific synergies is an interesting topic for the future.",18

The main difficulty is that the locations of the entities and the radio connectivities between the physical locations are not known in advance. We represent the problem by a topological graph of locations with known access links but unknown radio links and develop a novel ANCHOR algorithm for a set of autonomous robots to discover radio links dynamically and self-organize a radio network to connect the given entities with the least number of robots. We show in simulation analysis the algorithm scale near-linearly with maximum number of connected hops away from the terminals.

In this work, we present the design of a robot arm and data from experiments to characterize the accuracy and resolution of the force sensing. We describe a force-following manipulation experiment using two robots. The experiment measures strain on a rigid bar between two robots.

This concept is applied to a navigation framework that generates and selects trajectories in order to reach the goal location while minimizing the collision probability. Simulation scenarios are used to validate the overall crash probability and show its necessity in the proposed navigation approach.",37
icra,None,Designing optimally safe robot surface properties for minimizing the stress characteristics of human-robot collisions,"Jung-Jun Park,Sami Haddadin,Jae-Bok Song,Alin Albu-Schäffer,","Modeling of low severity soft-tissue injury due to unwanted collisions of a robot in collaborative settings is an important aspect to be treated in safe physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). Up to now, safety evaluations for pHRI were mainly conducted by using safety criteria related with impact forces and head accelerations. These indicate severe injury in the robotics context and leave out low severity injury such as contusions and lacerations. However, for the design of an intrinsically safer robot arm, a reliable evaluation of the collision between a human and a robot that is based on skin injury criteria is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel human-robot collision model with and without covering, which is based on the impact stress distribution. The reliability of the proposed collision model is verified by a comparison with various cadaver experiments taken from existing biomechanical literature. Since the stress characteristics acting on the human head can be analyzed with this new collision model, the occurrence of certain soft-tissue injury can be estimated. Furthermore, the method serves for selecting the appropriate covering parameters, as e.g. elastic modulus and thickness, by evaluating the chosen skin injury indices.",67
icra,None,Traffic light mapping and detection,"Nathaniel Fairfield,Chris Urmson,","The outdoor perception problem is a major challenge for driver-assistance and autonomous vehicle systems. While these systems can often employ active sensors such as sonar, radar, and lidar to perceive their surroundings, the state of standard traffic lights can only be perceived visually. By using a prior map, a perception system can anticipate and predict the locations of traffic lights and improve detection of the light state. The prior map also encodes the control semantics of the individual lights. This paper presents methods for automatically mapping the three dimensional positions of traffic lights and robustly detecting traffic light state onboard cars with cameras. We have used these methods to map more than four thousand traffic lights, and to perform onboard traffic light detection for thousands of drives through intersections.",235
icra,None,Segmentation-based online change detection for mobile robots,"Bradford Neuman,Boris Sofman,Anthony Stentz,J. Andrew Bagnell,","The high cost of damaging an expensive robot or injuring people or equipment in its environment make even rare failures unacceptable in many mobile robot applications. Often the objects that pose the highest risk for a mobile robot are those that were not present throughout previous successful traversals of an environment. Change detection, a closely related problem to novelty detection, is therefore of high importance to many mobile robotic applications that require a robot to operate repeatedly in the same environment. We present a novel algorithm for performing online change detection based on a previously developed robust online novelty detection system that uses a learned lower-dimensional representation of the feature space to perform measures of similarity. We then further improve this change detection system by incorporating online scene segmentation to better utilize contextual information in the environment. We validate these approaches through extensive experiments onboard a large outdoor mobile robot. Our results show that our approaches are robust to noisy sensor data and moderate registration errors and maintain their performance across diverse natural environments and conditions.",14
icra,None,Reactive balance control in walking based on a bipedal linear inverted pendulum model,"Federico Parietti,Hartmut Geyer,","Dynamic balance depends on proper foot placement in legged locomotion and corresponding placement strategies have mainly been developed using the linear inverted pendulum model as theoretical framework. While this model can identify single leg strategies for balance control, it does not consider the double support that is common to bipedal locomotion, indicating that current strategies do not fully exploit the theoretical potential of balance control in bipedal systems. Here we extend the linear inverted pendulum model to a bipedal system which includes double support dynamics, and derive a reactive balance controller based on foot placement and double stance length. We show that this controller enables the model to stand and walk at user-defined target speeds, to transition between these behaviors by acceleration and deceleration, and to react to intermittent disturbances and compensate for permanent ones, as long as they are compatible with the swing leg dynamics placing the feet. Finally, we discuss how the versatility of this balance controller depends on including double support and suggest further steps to improve dynamic balance control in bipedal systems.",14

The changing environment is modeled as an accumulation function which grows in areas that are not within range of the robot, and decreases in areas that are within range of the robot. The robot must continually move through the environment to prevent the accumulation of any area from growing unbounded. We consider the case in which a predefined path is given for the robot, and we focus on controlling the robot's speed along the path. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions on the speed controller of the robot for keeping the accumulation function bounded. We then search among the space of speed controllers that are parametrized by a finite set of basis functions. We develop a linear program to compute the optimal speed controller; that which minimizes the accumulation over the environment. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the controllers.",52

This method results in a slimmer, multi-dimensional lattice and offers the ability to satisfy goal constraints with precision. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF manipulator to perform experiments on a real mobile manipulation platform (Willow Garage's PR2).

icra,None,Mobile manipulation: Encoding motion planning options using task motion multigraphs,"Ioan A. Şucan,Lydia E. Kavraki,","This paper introduces the concept of a task motion multigraph, a data structure that can be used to reveal a difficulty specific to mobile manipulation: the possibility of planning in different state spaces in order to achieve the same goal. The different options reflect the mobile manipulator's ability to use different hardware components to perform a required task. For instance, a humanoid robot can open a door with its left arm or with its right arm. Thus, motion planning can be performed in the left arm's state space or in the right arm's state space. Given the specification of a task, it is shown how to encode the available motion planning options in a task motion multigraph. An algorithm that computes sequences of motion plans for mobile manipulators using the newly introduced notion is presented and evaluated. The algorithm makes use of information from the task motion multigraph to prioritize the spaces for which motion plans are computed. Experimental results show that reduced planning times can be obtained when considering the available planning options.",33

It is shown that swapping is efficient in operating a dual-arm cluster tool. For dual-arm cluster tools with wafer revisiting, if a swap strategy is applied, it forms a three wafer periodical process with three wafers completed in each period. Such a period contains three cycles in a revisiting process and another three cycles in non-revisiting process. Hence, analysis and scheduling of dual-arm cluster tools with wafer revisiting become very complicated. In this work, a Petri net model is developed to describe the operations of such tools. Based on it, it is found that if a swap strategy is applied to a dual-arm cluster tool with wafer revisiting, it is always in a transient state.

Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a battery management procedure to ensure that the batteries have sufficient charges to perform the desired tasks. This paper describes a method based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the Batteries State of Charge (SOC). The estimated consumption is compared with the SOC obtained by the EKF. A series of experiments using mini-robotic forklifts were performed to evaluate the method. The experimental results have shown its effectiveness using resistive loads.

icra,None,An arm suspension mechanism for an underactuated single legged hopping robot,"Christopher Schmidt-Wetekam,Thomas Bewley,","The geometry, kinematics, and mechanical development of a symmetric and adjustable arm suspension mechanism for an actively stabilized single-legged hopping robot are presented. This mechanism is a key enabling design feature of a recently developed two-armed reaction wheel stabilized monopod, that is capable of conventional wheeled roving, continuous hopping, and self-uprighting. The mechanism is shown to behave essentially as a digressive-rate torsional spring placed between the two arms, in series with a weaker progressive rate torsional spring tied to the leg/central body. This makes it well-suited to recovering substantial energy from hopping motion, whilst presenting negligible resistance to antisymmetric motions used to maintain side-to-side stability. Furthermore, by storing energy purely in tension, the problem of buckling encountered with compression springs is avoided, and, the effective torsional spring constant may be varied by adjusting the spring pretension. Finally, the mechanism is self-latching near maximum deflection, allowing the vehicle to fold into a compact roving configuration, and enabling ""running jumps"" via the release of this gradually accumulated spring energy.",18
icra,None,Residual-based stiffness estimation in robots with flexible transmissions,"Fabrizio Flacco,Alessandro De Luca,","We propose a novel approach for estimating the nonlinear stiffness of robot joints with flexible transmissions. Based on the definition of dynamic residual signals, we derive stiffness estimation methods that use only position and velocity measurements on the motor side and needs only the knowledge of the dynamic parameters of the motors. In particular, no extra force/torque sensing is needed. Two different strategies are considered, a model-based stiffness estimator and a black-box stiffness estimator. Both strategies consist of two stages. The first stage of the model-based estimator generates a residual signal that is a first-order filtered version of the flexibility torque of the transmission, while in the second stage a least squares fitting method is used to estimate the model parameters of the stiffness. The black-box estimator uses in the first stage a second-order residual that is directly a filtered version of the stiffness multi plied by the deformation rate of the transmission. In the second stage, a simple regressor provides the transmission stiffness in a singularity-robust way. Numerical results reported for the cases of constant, nonlinear, or variable stiffness transmissions demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and the relative merits of the two estimation strategies.",37

Tsagarakis,,","This paper focuses on the estimation of the impedance for a Variable Impedance Actuator (VIA) through torque and position measurements. Despite the recent development of several VIA, impedance control is not yet implemented in closed loop because of the difficulty of obtaining in real-time measurements of time-varying impedance. The estimation algorithm is proposed as an alternative approach to the standard procedures of impedance identification, to robustly tolerate the variability of the mechanical stiffness due, for example, to model uncertainties. The impedance estimator is therefore implemented on the Actuator with Adjustable Stiffness (AwAS). The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is proved through simulation and experimental results.",24
icra,None,Constraint-based equilibrium and stiffness control of variable stiffness actuators,"Matthew Howard,David J. Braun,Sethu Vijayakumar,","Considerable research effort has gone into the design of variable passive stiffness actuators (VSAs). A number of different mechanical designs have been proposed, aimed at either a biomorphic (i.e., antagonistic) design, compactness, or simplified modelling and control. In this paper, we propose a (model-based) unified control methodology that is able to exploit the benefits of variable stiffness independent of the specifics of the mechanical design. Our approach is based on forming constraints on commands sent to the VSA to ensure that the equilibrium position and stiffness of the VSA are tracked to the desired values. We outline how our approach can be used for tracking stiffness and equilibrium position both in joint and task space, and how it may be used in the context of constrained local optimal control. In our experiments we illustrate the utility of our approach in the context of online teleoperation, to transfer compliant human behaviour to a variable stiffness device.",26
icra,None,State feedback damping control for a multi DOF variable stiffness robot arm,"Florian Petit,Alin Albu-Schäffer,","The concept of variable stiffness actuation (VSA) for robotic joints promises advantages regarding robustness, energy efficiency, and task adaptability. The VS joints developed at DLR show very low intrinsic damping for efficient energy storage and retrieval whereas the desired damping behavior for task execution needs to be implemented in control. Robotic arms with multiple VS joints, as for example the DLR Hand Arm System, ask for advanced control algorithms which can cope with the elastic joints and the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system properties of the mechanical setup. We propose a MIMO controller for flexible joint robots based upon an eigenmode decoupling approach. For robustness reasons, the controller is designed to modify the intrinsic plant properties as little as possible while attaining the desired damping. A gain design algorithm is proposed. The controller is validated in simulations and experiments.",77

Inevitably, the components will be provided by different vendors, and will not be designed together, and in many cases also not implemented from the same source code repository. This paper presents a discussion on how to deal with this multi-component, multi vendor situation. This situation includes the least optimal case when most or all of the components are ""legacy"", in the sense that they have to be integrated as binary pieces of code, without the possibility to change the components for the sole purpose of facilitating system-level integration. The presented approach is illustrated by an application that integrates (i) two KUKA Light-Weight Robot FRI control components, (ii) a set of ROS components to control a Willow Garage PR2 robot, (iii) a Blender component for on-line visualization, and (iv) a set of Orocos/RTT components that take care of the data flow communication and some simple coordination between all components.",22

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to estimate the camera's pose by directly solving the corresponding least-squares problem algebraically. Specifically, the optimality conditions of the least-squares problem form a system of polynomial equations, which we efficiently solve through the eigendecomposition of a so-called multiplication matrix. Contrary to existing methods, the proposed algorithm (i) is guaranteed to find the globally optimal estimate in the least-squares sense, (ii) does not require initialization, and (iii) has computational cost only linear in the number of measurements. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to previous approaches is demonstrated through extensive simulations and experiments.",95
icra,None,Towards semantic robot description languages,"Lars Kunze,Tobias Roehm,Michael Beetz,","There is a semantic gap between simple but high-level action instructions like “Pick up the cup with the right hand” and low-level robot descriptions that model, for example, the structure and kinematics of a robot's manipulator. Currently, programmers bridge this gap by mapping abstract instructions to parametrized algorithms and rigid body parts of a robot within their control programs. By linking descriptions of robot components, i.e. sensors, actuators and control programs, via capabilities to actions in an ontology we equip robots with knowledge about themselves that allows them to infer the required components for performing a given action. Thereby a robot that is instructed by an end-user, a programmer, or even another robot to perform a certain action, can assess itself whether it is able and how to perform the requested action. This self-knowledge for robots could considerably change the way of robot control, robot interaction, robot programming, and multi-robot communication.",139
icra,None,Real-time image processing based on a task-pair scheduling concept,"Thomas Ihme,Kai Wetzelsbergery,Mario Speckertz,Jörn Fischerx,","Moving in unknown environments requires real-time processing of sensor information e.g. for map reconstruction and navigation. In case of stereo image processing results have to be available in time even if high computational costs occur. This paper addresses the problem of real-time image processing for motion planning and distance estimation based on stereo camera images. Ensuring hard real-time with complex algorithms on modern computer architectures is difficult to realize due to unpredictable execution times of algorithms with data dependent runtime. To solve this problem a scheduling scheme based on task pairs can be used to avoid an unpredicted state after a deadline violation. A new two level scheduler as extension of RTAI/Linux will be introduced. This new scheduling scheme allows to use AnyTime algorithms, which can provide results even if the task is not finished. A SURF algorithm used for stereo image processing was modified to match the AnyTime concept: First results are made available early and are improved over time. In case of a missed deadline the image processing task will not fail due to already provided results. Design considerations, implementation and results will be shown.",4

Procedures are presented to apply this process to an existing replanning system, and to determine its required accuracy and timeliness. It is shown that the TOPE process can yield lower total times than other planning systems if these requirements are met.",2
icra,None,Any-angle path planning on non-uniform costmaps,"Sunglok Choi,Wonpil Yu,","A* on grid maps generates a path with zig-zag pattern, but Theta* is known to be free from this disadvantage. Theta* assumes that cost of each cell, cell-cost, is uniform, but non-uniform costs are effective ways to represent traversability on grid maps. Theta* does not work on non-uniform costmaps. In this paper, we generalize Theta* toward non-uniform costmaps. To extend Theta*, we propose two kinds of cost functions considering non-uniform cell-costs. The first function adopts the arithmetic mean under the assumption that all cells contribute equally to the overall cost. The second function uses the weighted mean by considering the true traversal length on each cell. We applied the proposed methods to two types of maps: synthetic and real maps. An experiment on synthetic maps quantifies performance of the two methods in terms of accuracy and computing time. The other experiment on real maps presents the effectiveness of Theta* with the proposed methods. The generalized Theta* generated the least-cost path compared with the original Theta* and A* on non-uniform costmaps.",20

However, the traditional methods divide the problem into parallel parking, perpendicular parking, and echelon parking, then different methods are applied for the parking motion planning. In this paper a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) based path planner is implemented for autonomous vehicle parking problem, which treats all the situations in a unified manner. As the RRT method sometimes generates some complicated paths, a smoother is also implemented for smoothing generated paths. The proposed algorithm is verified in simulation and generates applicable solutions for the proposed application scenarios.",48
icra,None,SIPP: Safe interval path planning for dynamic environments,"Mike Phillips,Maxim Likhachev,","Robotic path planning in static environments is a thoroughly studied problem that can typically be solved very efficiently. However, planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is still computationally challenging because it requires adding time as an additional dimension to the search-space explored by the planner. In order to avoid the increase in the dimensionality of the planning problem, most real-time approaches to path planning treat dynamic obstacles as static and constantly re-plan as dynamic obstacles move. Although gaining efficiency, these approaches sacrifice optimality and even completeness. In this paper, we develop a planner that builds on the observation that while the number of safe timesteps in any configuration may be unbounded, the number of safe time intervals in a configuration is finite and generally very small. A safe interval is a time period for a configuration with no collisions and if it were extended one timestep in either direction, it would then be in collision. The planner exploits this observation and constructs a search-space with states defined by their configuration and safe interval, resulting in a graph that generally only has a few states per configuration. On the theoretical side, we show that our planner can provide the same optimality and completeness guarantees as planning with time as an additional dimension. On the experimental side, in simulation tests with up to 200 dynamic obstacles, we show that our planner is significantly faster, making it feasible to use in real-time on robots operating in large dynamic environments. We also ran several real robot trials on the PR2, a mobile manipulation platform.",207

icra,None,Inference algorithm based wireless and pyroelectric sensory fusion system for indoor human/robot localization and monitoring,"Ren C. Luo,Ogst Chen,","Indoor monitoring system for robot and human is an important issue in robotics research. In this study, we propose an indoor monitoring system based on wireless and pyroelectric infrared (WPIR) sensory fusion system. Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) system alone for localization provides less accurate information of human location and suffers from multiple targets localization. Furthermore, radio frequency (RF) localization system alone is also constrained by its limited accuracy. We develop a sensor network based localization method called WPIR inference algorithm. This algorithm determine the fused position from both PIR localization system and radio frequency signal localization system which utilizes received signal strength (RSS) model. We have developed and experimentally demonstrated a WPIR sensory fusion system which can be applied in localizing targets, such as human and robot. With the proper localization mechanism in the indoor environment, the provision of appropriate services for people can be realized with less expensive cost.",72
icra,None,Motion tracking with fixed-lag smoothing: Algorithm and consistency analysis,"Tue-Cuong Dong-Si,Anastasios I. Mourikis,","This paper presents a fixed-lag smoothing algorithm for tracking the motion of a mobile robot in real time. The algorithm processes measurements from proprioceptive (e.g., odometry, inertial measurement unit) and exteroceptive (e.g., camera, laser scanner) sensors, in order to estimate the trajectory of the vehicle. Smoothing is carried out in the information-filtering framework, and utilizes iterative minimization, which renders the method well-suited for applications where the effects of the measurements' nonlinearity are significant. The algorithm attains bounded computational complexity by marginalizing out older states. The key contribution of this work is a detailed analysis of the effects of the marginalization process on the consistency properties of the estimator. Based on this analysis, a linearization scheme that results in substantially improved accuracy, compared to the standard linearization approach, is proposed. Both simulation and real-world experimental results are presented, which demonstrate that the proposed method attains localization accuracy superior to that of competing approaches.",96

The algorithm fuses information from odometry with observations of naturally occurring static point features in the environment. A key contribution of this work is a novel approach for computing the particle weights, which does not require including the feature positions in the state vector. As a result, the computational and sample complexities of the algorithm remain low even in feature-dense environments. We validate the effectiveness of the approach extensively with both simulations as well as real-world data, and compare its performance against that of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and FastSLAM. Results from the simulation tests show that the particle filter approach is better than these competing approaches in terms of the RMS error. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that the approach is capable of achieving good localization accuracy in complex environments.",34

In this paper, we aim to analyze all sensory data available to separate a scene into a few physically meaningful parts, which we term structure, while discarding background clutter. In particular, we consider the combination of image and range data, and base our decision in both appearance and 3D shape. Our main contribution is the development of a framework to perform scene segmentation that preserves physical objects using multi-modal data. We combine image and range data using a novel mid-level fusion technique based on the concept of regions that avoids any pixel-level correspondences between data sources. We associate groups of pixels with 3D points into multi-modal regions that we term regionlets, and measure the structure-ness of each regionlet using simple, bottom-up cues from image and range features. We show that the highest-ranked regionlets correspond to the most prominent objects in the scene. We verify the validity of our approach on 105 scenes of household environments.",46
icra,None,Multi-task learning of system dynamics with maximum information gain,"Jose F. Zubizarreta-Rodriguez,Fabio Ramos,",This paper introduces a new approach to adoptively learn the dynamics of a robotic system. The methodology is based on maximizing the information gain from new observations while modeling the dynamics with a Multiple Output Gaussian Process (MOGP). High-dimensional state action spaces with unknown dependencies between inputs and outputs can be highly computationally expensive to learn. Gaussian process modeling is a Bayesian technique that naturally overcomes one of the most difficult problems in machine learning known as over-fitting. This makes it very appealing for on-line problems where testing multiple hypothesis is difficult. The computational cost of the learning task is reduced by having a smaller dataset of informative training points. Therefore we introduce a learning strategy capable of determining the most informative training set for the MOGP. This method can be implemented for learning the behavior of dynamic systems where due to their complexity and disturbances are infeasible to be analytically defined. The benefits of our approach are verified in two experiments: learning the dynamics of a cart pole system in simulation and the dynamics of a robotic blimp.,5

Closed-loop identification is performed with a direct method, where a PD controller, which stabilizes the system without knowledge about its parameters, closes the loop. It is shown that when the perturbation signal is absent, exponential convergence can be claimed, making the identification algorithm robust. However, when there exists a perturbation signal it can be established a region where the parameter estimates belong to, and it is shown how this region is affected by the PD controller gains.",2
icra,None,Learning to predict how rigid objects behave under simple manipulation,"Marek Kopicki,Sebastian Zurek,Rustam Stolkin,Thomas Mörwald,,","An important problem in robotic manipulation is the ability to predict how objects behave under manipulative actions. This ability is necessary to allow planning of object manipulations. Physics simulators can be used to do this, but they model many kinds of object interaction poorly. An alternative is to learn a motion model for objects by interacting with them. In this paper we address the problem of learning to predict the interactions of rigid bodies in a probabilistic framework, and demonstrate the results in the domain of robotic push manipulation. A robot arm applies random pushes to various objects and observes the resulting motion with a vision system. The relationship between push actions and object motions is learned, and enables the robot to predict the motions that will result from new pushes. The learning does not make explicit use of physics knowledge, or any pre-coded physical constraints, nor is it even restricted to domains which obey any particular rules of physics. We use regression to learn efficiently how to predict the gross motion of a particular object. We further show how different density functions can encode different kinds of information about the behaviour of interacting objects. By combining these as a product of densities, we show how learned predictors can cope with a degree of generalisation to previously unencountered object shapes, subjected to previously unencountered push directions. Performance is evaluated through a combination of virtual experiments in a physics simulator, and real experiments with a 5-axis arm equipped with a simple, rigid finger.",77

A first prototype of a robotic platform for minimally invasive surgery is described, which has two instrument arms, an autonomous robotic camera assistant and two haptic devices to control the instrument arms. The approach of long-term prediction and optimal camera positioning was tested in a phantom experiment with a hit rate of over 89% for predicting the movement of the end-effectors.

While previous approaches first try to build a 3D model in order to do planning and control, our method neither attempts to build nor requires a 3D model. Instead, our method first classifies the type of indoor environment the MAV is in, and then uses vision algorithms based on perspective cues to estimate the desired direction to fly.

First, we introduce a convenient technique for mapping traffic light locations from recorded video data using tracking, back-projection, and triangulation. In order to achieve robust real-time detection results in a variety of lighting conditions, we combine several probabilistic stages that explicitly account for the corresponding sources of sensor and data uncertainty. In addition, our approach is the first to account for multiple lights per intersection, which yields superior results by probabilistically combining evidence from all available lights.

Within this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for monocular visual localization for MAVs based on the concept of virtual views in 3D space. Under the assumption that significant parts of the scene do not alter their geometry and serve as natural landmarks, the accuracy of our visual approach outperforms consumer grade GPS systems. In an experimental setup we compare our approach to a state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm and evaluate the performance by geometric validation from an observer's view.

This may be because of a tacit assumption that working with a textured occupancy grid with a camera would be impractical. We demonstrate that a textured occupancy grid can be combined with an extremely simple monocular localization algorithm to produce a viable localization solution. Our approach is simple, efficient, and produces localization results comparable to laser localization results. A consequence of this result is that a single map representation, the textured occupancy grid, can now be used for humans, robots with laser rangefinders, and robots with just a single camera.",24

The strategy here proposed enhances the results of a previous work by enlarging the number of considered constraints. In particular, still accounting for the existence of bounds on joint velocities and torques, in this paper, the presence of constraints on joint accelerations is also considered. Furthermore, the nonlinear filter, which represents the core of the scaling system, has been revised in order to devise a new and more compact implementation.

icra,None,Singularity-robust task-space tracking control of robot,"C. C. Cheah,X. Li,","Singularity issue has been a long standing problem in task-space control of robot. It is commonly assumed in the theoretical analysis of task-space control system that the robot is operating in a finite task space such that singularity problem can be avoided. This limits the potential workspace of the robot when task-space control is employed. In this paper, a singularity-robust task-space controller is proposed for tracking control of robot manipulator. The proposed controller consists of a joint-space position controller that is activated when the robot is near singular configurations, and a task-space tracking controller that is used when the robot leaves the singular region. Therefore, the robot can start from the singular regions and transit smoothly from joint space to task space. It can also enter the singular region during the course of movement. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed with consideration of the singularity issue. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",14

By capitalizing on the rotor magnetic field implicit dependence on orientation, the control law derivation and torque coefficient estimation can be obtained simultaneously and directly from field measurements without explicit determination of the rotor orientation, thereby improving computational efficiency and eliminating error accumulation.

Treebot can maneuver on a complex tree environment, but only five actuators are used in the mechanism. As a result, Treebot can keep in compact size and lightweight. Although Treebot weighs only 600 grams, it has payload capability of 1.75 kg which is nearly three times of its own weight. On top of that, the special design of the gripper permits zero energy consumption in static gripping. Numerous experiments have been conducted on real trees. Experimental results reveal that Treebot has excellent climbing performance on a wide variety of trees.",94

Combined with a pair of thrusters, the Eyeball ROV can move in any direction with non-holonomic constraints. In this paper the design concept is presented first, followed by dynamic and hydrodynamic analysis.

A dynamic model is established in this paper. Locomotion of the line-walking robot is discussed in detail and the line-walking cycle of the designed mechanism is composed of a single-support phase and a double-support phase. Finally, a PD+ gravity compensation method is introduced for the controller design in the single-support phase and a complaint controller with estimated force is implemented during the double-support phase.

icra,None,A practical load detection framework considering uncertainty in hydraulic pressure-based force measurement for construction manipulator,"Mitsuhiro Kamezaki,Hiroyasu Iwata,Shigeki Sugano,","This paper proposes a practical framework for detecting (identifying the on-off state of) the external force applied to a construction manipulator (front load) by using a hydraulic sensor. Such a detection system requires high accuracy and robustness considering the uncertainty in pressure-based force measurement. Our framework is thus organized into (i) identifying the dominant error force component (self-weight and driving force) using theoretical and experimental estimation and binarizing the analog external cylinder force, (ii) evaluating detection conditions to address indeterminate conditions such as stroke-end, singular posture, and impulsive or oscillatory force and redefining three-valued outputs such as on, off, or not de terminate (ND), and (iii) outputting the front load decision by combining all the cylinder decisions to improve robustness through priority analysis. Experiments were conducted using an instrumented hydraulic arm. Results indicate that our frame work adequately detects on, off, and ND outputs of the front load in various detection conditions without misidentification.",1
icra,None,Human arm motion modeling and long-term prediction for safe and efficient Human-Robot-Interaction,"Hao Ding,Gunther Reißig,Kurniawan Wijaya,Dino Bortot,Klaus Bengler,,","Modeling and predicting human behavior is indispensable when industrial robots interacting with human operators are to be manipulated safely and efficiently. One challenge is that human operators tend to follow different motion patterns, depending on their intention and the structure of the environment. This precludes the use of classical estimation techniques based on kinematic or dynamic models, especially for the purpose of long-term prediction. In this paper, we propose a method based on Hidden Markov Models to predict the region of the workspace that is possibly occupied by the human within a prediction horizon. In contrast to predictions in the form of single points such as most likely human positions as obtained from previous approaches, the regions obtained here may serve as safety constraints when the robot motion is planned or optimized. This way one avoids collisions with a probability not less than a predefined threshold. The practicability of our method is demonstrated by successfully and accurately predicting the motion of a human arm in two scenarios involving multiple motion patterns.",47
icra,None,Horizon line estimation in glacial environments using multiple visual cues,"Stephen Williams,Ayanna M. Howard,","While the arctic possesses significant information of scientific value, surprisingly little work has focused on developing robotic systems to collect this data. For arctic robotic data collection to be a viable solution, a method for navigating in the arctic, and thus of assessing glacial terrain, must be developed. Segmenting the ground plane from the rest of the image is one common aspect of a visual hazard detection system. However, the properties of glacial images, namely low contrast, overcast sky, and cloud, mountain, and snow sharing common colors, pose difficulties for most visual algorithms. A horizon line detection scheme is presented which uses multiple visual cues to rank candidate horizon segments, then constructs a horizon line consistent with those cues. Weak cues serve to reinforce a selected path, while strong cues have the ability to redirect it. Further, the system infers the horizon location in areas that are visually ambiguous. The performance of the proposed system has been tested on multiple data sets collected on two different glaciers in Alaska, and compares favorably, both in terms of time and classification performance, to representative segmentation algorithms from several different classes.",12
icra,None,Distributed robust data fusion based on dynamic voting,"Eduardo Montijano,Sonia Martínez,Carlos Sagues,","Data association mistakes, estimation and measurement errors are some of the factors that can contribute to incorrect observations in robotic sensor networks. In order to act reliably, a robotic network must be able to fuse and correct its perception of the world by discarding any outlier information. This is a difficult task if the network is to be deployed remotely and the robots do not have access to ground-truth sites or manual calibration. In this paper, we present a novel, distributed scheme for robust data fusion in autonomous robotic networks. The proposed method adapts the RANSAC algorithm to exploit measurement redundancy, and enables robots determine an inlier observation with local communications. Different hypotheses are generated and voted for using a dynamic consensus algorithm. As the hypotheses are computed, the robots can change their opinion making the voting process dynamic. Assuming that at least one hypothesis is initialized with only inliers, we show that the method converges to the maximum likelihood of all the inlier observations in a general instance. Several simulations exhibit the good performance of the algorithm, which also gives acceptable results in situations where the conditions to guarantee convergence do not hold.",14
icra,None,A probabilistic quality metric for camera placement in 3D reconstructions,"Eric Holec,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","This paper describes the use of a probabilistic quality metric for planning camera placement for 3D reconstructions. A probabilistic quality metric estimates the probability of a reconstruction achieving a desired goal. This probabilistic model leads to the natural integration of many different factors influencing the quality of a reconstruction without relying on arbitrary weights for those factors. The specific factors addressed here are occlusions, feature matching, and feature localization. It is demonstrated how these factors impact the quality of a reconstruction and how they can be accounted for in a probabilistic manner. The developed quality metric is then used to optimize a camera network for patient tracking during tomotherapy.",0

It is known that a strong ECF jet is generated under nonuniform electric field, for example, the field with a pair of needle and ring electrodes. This study introduces the ECF jet to develop a novel flexible robot hand. First, we characterize the ECF jet generator which could be a micro fluid pressure source of the robot hand, and confirm the effect of the variation of electrode parameters and the number of electrode pairs on its performance. Next, we investigate the characteristics of the robot finger which mainly consists of the ECF jet generator, a flexible rubber finger and an ECF tank. The robot finger is integrated with the pressure source (ECF jet generator) and the tank, and is successfully driven. Finally we developed a five-fingered flexible robot hand and demonstrate that the robot hand can grasp some objects with various shapes without any complex controller. The height, the width and the mass of the robot hand are approximately 60 mm, 40 mm and 15 g, respectively.",50

To have a sensitive shell on the robot, normally we need to add an extra layer of electrodes or sensors. In this paper, we realized a tactile shell based on a Lamb wave diffraction method. Surface-contact sensing is calibrated and tested with a finger; the spatial resolution is 17 × 13 on a 100 mm × 75 mm projected-dimension surface. Structure of the tactile shell comprises only four small (25 mm 2 × 0.5 mm) piezoelectric ceramics transducers bonded to the edges of the shell. The sensing results have good accuracy with response time less than 15 ms, the presented method is able to be used for a humanoid robot's whole-body tactile sensing.",3

The method relies on using the tactile sensor as an imaging device, and builds an object representation based on mosaics of tactile measurements. We then describe an algorithm that is able to recognize an object using a small number of tactile sensor readings. Our approach makes extensive use of sequential state estimation techniques from the mobile robotics literature, whereby we view the object recognition problem as one of estimating a consistent location within a set of object maps.

icra,None,Realtime perception for catching a flying ball with a mobile humanoid,"Oliver Birbach,Udo Frese,Berthold Bäuml,","This paper presents a realtime perception system for catching flying balls with DLR's humanoid Rollin' Justin. We use a two-staged bottom up approach in which we first detect balls as circles and feed these measurements into a multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT). The novel circle detection scheme works in realistic scenes without tuning parameters or background assumptions. We extend the classical multi-hypothesis tracking with prior information about the expected trajectories, therefore limiting the number of hypotheses in the first place. Since the robot starts moving while the ball is still tracked, the cameras shake heavily. A 6-DOF inertial measurements unit (IMU) is integrated to compensate this motion. Using ground-truth from a marker based tracking system we evaluate the metrical accuracy of the motion compensation as well as the tracker's prediction accuracy while in motion.",69
icra,None,Finding a needle in a specular haystack,"Nitesh Shroff,Yuichi Taguchi,Oncel Tuzel,Ashok Veeraraghavan,,,","Progress in machine vision algorithms has led to widespread adoption of these techniques to automate several industrial assembly tasks. Nevertheless, shiny or specular objects which are common in industrial environments still present a great challenge for vision systems. In this paper, we take a step towards this problem under the context of vision-aided robotic assembly. We show that when the illumination source moves, the specular highlights remain in a region whose radius is inversely proportional to the surface curvature. This allows us to extract regions of the object that have high surface curvature. These points of high curvature can be used as features for specular objects. Further, an inexpensive multi-flash camera (MFC) design can be used to reliably extract these features. We show that one can use multiple views of the object using the MFC in order to triangulate and obtain the 3D location and pose of the shiny objects. Finally, we show a system consisting of a robot arm with an MFC that can perform automated detection and pose estimation of shiny screws within a cluttered bin, achieving position and orientation errors less than 0.5 mm and 0.8° respectively.",23
icra,None,Transparent object detection and reconstruction on a mobile platform,"Ulrich Klank,Daniel Carton,Michael Beetz,","In this paper we propose a novel approach to detect and reconstruct transparent objects. This approach makes use of the fact that many transparent objects, especially the ones consisting of usual glass, absorb light in certain wavelengths [1]. Given a controlled illumination, this absorption is measurable in the intensity response by comparison to the background. We show the usage of a standard infrared emitter and the intensity sensor of a time of flight (ToF) camera to reconstruct the structure given we have a second view point. The structure can not be measured by the usual 3D measurements of the ToF camera. We take advantage of this fact by deriving this internal sensory contradiction from two ToF images and reconstruct an approximated surface of the original transparent object. Therefor we are using a perspectively invariant matching in the intensity channels from the first to the second view of initially acquired candidates. For each matched pixel in the first view a 3D movement can be predicted given their original 3D measurement and the known distance to the second camera position. If their line of sight did not pass a transparent object or suffered any other major defect, this prediction will highly correspond to the actual measured 3D points of the second view. Otherwise, if a detectable error occurs, we approximate a more exact point to point matching and reconstruct the original shape by triangulating the points in the stereo setup. We tested our approach using a mobile platform with one Swissranger SR4k. As this platform is mobile, we were able to create a stereo setup by moving it. Our results show a detection of transparent objects on tables while simultaneously identifying opaque objects that also existed in the test setup. The viability of our results is demonstrated by a successful automated manipulation of the respective transparent object.",71
icra,None,Dynamics-based visual inspection through real-time modal analysis,"Hua Yang,Takeshi Takaki,Idaku Ishii,","In this study, we propose the concept of dynamics-based visual inspection for the verification of structural dynamic properties of a vibrating object; the inspection method involves the analysis of the vibration distribution of the object by using a high-frame-rate video. Under unknown ambient excitation, modal parameters of an excited object are simultaneously estimated to determine its input-invariant dynamic properties by using a fast output-only modal analysis algorithm, SSI-CPAST. The algorithm was implemented on a 2000-fps vision platform, and it facilitates non-destructive monitoring of the structure of beam-shaped objects vibrating at dozens of hertz; the algorithm detects small changes in the dynamic properties of the objects caused by internal defects such as fatigue cracks. The modal parameters resonant frequency and mode shape were actually estimated for beam-shaped objects excited by human finger tapping to verify the performance of 2000-fps real-time dynamics-based visual inspection.",2
icra,None,Cross-dataset facial expression recognition,"Haibin Yan,Marcelo H. Ang,Aun Neow Poo,","This paper investigates the problem of cross-dataset facial expression recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been formally addressed in the literature. Conventional facial expression recognition methods assume expression images in the training and testing sets are collected under the same condition such that they are independent and identically distributed. In many real applications, this assumption may not hold as the testing data are usually collected online and generally more uncontrollable than the training data, and hence, they are likely different from the training data. This problem is referred to as cross-dataset facial expression recognition in this paper as the training and testing data are considered to be collected from different datasets due to different acquisition conditions. To address this, we propose a new transfer subspace learning approach to learn a feature space which transfers the knowledge gained from the training set to the target (testing) data to improve the recognition performance under cross-dataset scenarios. Experimental results for facial expression recognition tasks on different datasets are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",27

For resolving the inherent generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity of the UPS, we present a GBR disambiguation method based on a framework of entropy minimization, and extend it using a graph cuts energy minimization to decrease the influence of noise and further refine the recovered surface normal.

A way to handle these difficulties is using force control. An experimental case where a semi-compliant rib is aligned to multiple surfaces is used as an example to show this. The constraint-based task specification framework is used for the modelling and control, and the search and alignment sequence required for the assembly is modeled with a state machine.

The described approach is easy to apply to other fields and more complicated assembly operations as well.",8
icra,None,Multiple-priority impedance control,"Robert Platt,Muhammad Abdallah,Charles Wampler,","Impedance control is well-suited to robot manipulation applications because it gives the designer a measure of control over how the manipulator to conforms to the environment. However, in the context of end-effector impedance control when the robot manipulator is redundant with respect to end-effector configuration, the question arises regarding how to control the impedance of the redundant joints. This paper considers multi-priority impedance control where a second-priority joint space impedance operates in the null space of a first-priority Cartesian impedance at the end-effector. A control law is proposed that realizes both impedances while observing the priority constraint such that a weighted quadratic error function is optimized. This control law is shown to be a generalization of several motion and impedance control laws found in the literature. The paper makes explicit two forms of the control law. In the first, parametrization by passive inertia values allows the control law to be implemented without requiring end-effector force measurements. In the second, a class of parametrizations is introduced that makes the null space impedance independent of end-effector forces. The theoretical results are illustrated in simulation.",60

The proposed method determines critically damped PD control trajectories that precisely obtain target position and velocity constraints for arbitrary initial conditions. An analytic solution provides the PD control parameters, thereby determining the required impedance. The resulting controller precisely interpolates the target state by solving the full boundary-value problem. Control parameters are time-invariant, and need only be recomputed if the system diverges from the computed trajectory due to unexpected forces or noise. The resulting method provides control with automatically determined compliance, yielding natural response to perturbation.",8

For orientation, quaternion representation is applied to give singularity-free orientation control. Augmenting quaternion feedback to the state vector of the system, the stability is analytically proved, and dynamic simulation is conducted for validation of the method. Competition between position and orientation control is also briefly discussed based on the simulation results.",8

The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance. A new, human-safe design is also described: the arm uses stepper motors with a series-elastic transmission for the proximal four degrees of freedom (DOF), and non-series-elastic robotics servos for the distal three DOF. Tradeoffs of the design are discussed, especially in the areas of human safety and control bandwidth.

icra,None,Toward adaptation and reuse of advanced robotic software,"Christopher R. Baker,John M. Dolan,Shige Wang,Bakhtiar B. Litkouhi,","As robotic software systems become larger and more complex, it is increasingly important to reuse existing software components to control development costs. For a broad class of relatively simple components, ranging from sensor and actuation interfaces to many simple perception and navigation algorithms, this can be a reasonably straightforward process, and many excellent frameworks have been developed in recent years that support reuse of such components in novel systems. However, there is also a class of more advanced software components, such as for modeling and interacting with complex environments, for which reuse can be a much more challenging problem. In particular, many advanced robotic algorithms can be highly sensitive to the perception and actuation capabilities of the specific robots they are deployed on, in turn requiring significant and invasive modifications to accommodate the specific capabilities of a different robotic system. This work examines the nature of this sensitivity and proposes a novel design methodology for isolating a stable, reusable ""core"" algorithm from any platform-specific enhancements, or ""supplemental"" effects. Modern software engineering techniques are used to encapsulate these supplemental effects separately from the core algorithm, allowing platform-specific details to be accommodated by modular substitution instead of direct modification of the ""core"" component. This methodology is experimentally evaluated on existing software for autonomous driving behaviors, yielding useful insights into the creation of highly adaptable robotic software components.",6

icra,None,Optimal control of multi-input SMA actuator arrays using graph theory,"Leslie J. Flemming,David E. Johnson,Stephen A. Mascaro,","Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are compact and have high force-to-weight ratios, making them strong candidates to actuate robots, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. To optimize speed and energy consumption, SMA actuators have been embedded in an NxN vascular network that can deliver electric and thermofluidic energy to the each actuator. The scalable architecture of the vascular network allows for 2N control devices (valves, transistors) to be shared amongst N 2 actuators, so that as the number of actuators increases, the number of required control devices scales at a smaller rate. This Network Array Architecture (NAA) allows for each actuator to be controlled individually or in discrete subarrays. However, not all combinations of actuators can be activated simultaneously; therefore in general, a sequence of control commands will be need to be executed in order to achieve the desired actuation. By treating each actuator as having a binary state, the combined states of the actuator array can be represented by graph theory, where states are nodes and the transitions between states are graph edges. By properly weighting the costs of the transitions, graph search techniques can be used to find optimal sets of control commands for desired state changes. This paper formulates the control of NAA actuators systems as a graph theory problem, and characterizes the ability of search algorithms to optimize a weighted combination of speed and energy usage, while minimizing computational cost.",10

Our approach (SLASHDP) learns the low dimensional cost structure of an optimal control problem via an efficient spectral method. This structure results in a symmetric value function that serves as a an efficiently-computable surrogate for the true value function. High-quality feedback motion plans can then be obtained from the symmetric value function. Experimental results show that SLASHDP yields higher-quality plans than can be obtained by post-processing plans generated by a sampling-based motion planner, and with less computational effort for very high-dimensional problems.

icra,None,Design and analysis of Group Escape Behavior for distributed autonomous mobile robots,"Hongkyu Min,Zhidong Wang,","In designing distributed control architecture of multiple autonomous robot system, behaviors and cooperative control strategies using by insects, birds, fishes, animals and human being are usually considered as good models because they are with many very nice features such as simplicity, flexibility, robustness and fault tolerance, etc. Within them, schooling behavior of fish and flocking behavior of birds were well studied for controlling group motion of robots with local sensing ability and local interaction only. Several research groups have proposed and successfully demonstrated full distributed control architectures for various size robot swarm system via simulations or experiments. To many types of fish schools, we can observe another very interesting behavior, Group Escape Behavior which shows that all fish change their moving directions rapidly and cooperatively without global broadcasting communications while some fish sense a predator. In this study, we proposed a distributed algorithm to perform Group Escape Behavior without inter-robot communication by mimicking behaviors of fish schools. It provides an alternate method for robot teams to achieve some emergency tasks while inter-robot communication is restricted. In this paper, the proposed control mechanism for achieving group escape behavior is introduced, and the characteristics of escape motion mode transition in the swarm are discussed. Some simulation results and experimental results are provided for illustrating the validity of the proposed algorithm, and for analyzing performance of the group escape behavior implemented.",22
icra,None,High-speed mobile robot control in off-road conditions: A multi-model based adaptive approach,"Roland Lenain,Benoit Thuilot,Oliver Hach,Philippe Martinet,","This paper is focused on the design of a control strategy for the path tracking of off-road mobile robots acting at high speed. In order to achieve high accuracy in such a context, uncertain and fast dynamics have to be explicitly taken into account. Since these phenomena (grip conditions, delays due to inertial and low-level control properties) are hardly measurable directly, the proposed approach relies on predictive and observer-based adaptive control techniques. In particular, the adaptive part is based on an observer loop, taking advantage of both kinematic and dynamic vehicle models. This multi-model based adaptive approach permits to adapt on-line the grip conditions (represented by cornering stiffnesses), enabling highly reactive sideslip angles observation and then accurate path tracking. The relevance of this approach is investigated through full scale experiments.",26
icra,None,Experimental results for stabilizing of a bicycle with a flywheel balancer,"Lychek Keo,Kiyoshi Yoshino,Masahiro Kawaguchi,Masaki Yamakita,","In this paper, an experimental validation of a new balancer configuration for stabilizing of an unmanned bicycle is presented. The balancer can be configured as a flywheel mode or a balancer mode by shifting the center of gravity of the balancer. This balancer configuration is changed according to the situation of the bicycle system, which corresponds to the change of the dimension of the system. The balancer is configured as a flywheel, when disturbances to the system are large, and it will switch to the balancer when the position of the center of the gravity should be shifted. Stabilizing bicycle with the flywheel has better performance than the balancer but it cannot control to shift the bicycle angle to track the desired value, unlike the balancer which can do this motion. The balancing controller is derived based on an output-zeroing controller. Numerical simulation and experimental results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",35
icra,None,On generating continuous-curvature paths for line following problem with curvature and sharpness constraints,"Vicent Girbés,Leopoldo Armesto,Josep Tornero,","The main contribution of the paper is to provide a method to generate continuous curvature paths in order to converge to a line, based on combinations of clothoids with line segments and circular arcs. Different kinds of continuous curvature paths have been defined in order to solve problems with different complexity. The type of paths that we have generated get the benefits of higher comfort and safety. Generated paths take into account lower and upper bounds of sharpness and curvature simultaneously, while it is not the case of other continuous curvature paths such as Elementary and BiElementary paths. Wheeled mobile robots following a path with continuous curvature may also get benefit on wheels slippage reduction and low odometry errors, since transitions are softer with constant curvature rates.",23
icra,None,Point-to-point stable motion planning of wheeled mobile robots with multiple arms for heavy object manipulation,"Khalil Alipour,S. Ali A. Moosavian,","Heavy object manipulation by wheeled mobile manipulators may lead to serious consequences such as postural instability, and this necessitates dynamically stable planning based on systematic analysis to better predict and eliminate the possibility of toppling down. In the present study, stable motion planning is investigated for wheeled mobile manipulators during heavy object manipulation tasks. It is assumed that the initial and final poses of a heavy payload are specified. Based on these known postures of the payload two proper configurations for robotic system is defined. Then, between these two initial and final poses, appropriate trajectories for multiple robotic arms relative to the moving base are planned without considering the postural stability of the system. Next, motion of the moving base is planned so that the stability of the overall system is guaranteed while its predetermined initial and final positions and velocities are fulfilled. To this end, the problem of stable planning is solved as an optimization problem. A proper cost function is considered, to be minimized, which is a measure of the control effort to be used for the platform motion. Moreover, using the new dynamic postural Moment-Height Stability (MHS) measure, a constraint denoting the system dynamic stability is derived and satisfied. The proposed planning approach is applied to move a heavy object with a wheeled robotic system that consists of two manipulators, where the obtained results reveal a stable optimal motion besides satisfaction of various practical aspects.",10
icra,None,Steering and balance controls of an electrical bicycle using integral sliding mode control,"Wen-Shyong Yu,Chan-Chih Yeh,","In this paper, steering and balance controls of an unmanned electrical bicycle (e-bicycle) using an integral sliding mode control scheme including adaptive neural network disturbance elimination is proposed. The e-bicycle has three degrees of freedom in the space, and they are driven by an in-wheel brushless motor setup in the rear wheel and a servomotor on the saddle seat post steers for handlebar grip control via a planar four-bar linkage, while keeping the lean angle to be zero. Some unknown underactuated uncertainties are approximated by the adaptive neural network. The constrained Lagrangian's equations are derived to simulate the motion of the e-bicycle in state-space form with uncertainty. Based on Lyapunov stability theorem, the proposed control scheme can ensure the stability of the system and parameter estimations convergence, and achieve steering and balance controls. Finally, some simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed control scheme.",6
icra,None,Performance-oriented networked visual servo control with sending rate scheduling,"Haiyan Wu,Lei Lou,Chih-Chung Chen,Sandra Hirche,Kolja Kühnlenz,","In order to speed up image processing in visual servoing, the distributed computational power across networks and appropriate data transmission mechanisms are of particular interest. In this paper, a high sampling rate of visual feedback is achieved by distributed computation on a cloud image processing platform. For target tracking with a networked visual servo control system, a switching control law considering the varying feedback delay caused by image processing and data transmission is applied to improve the control performance. A sending rate scheduling strategy aiming at saving the network load is proposed based on the tracking error. Experiments on a 7 degree-of-freedom (DoF) manipulator are carried out to validate the proposed approach. The proposed approach shows a similar control performance as a system without sending rate scheduling, however, beneficially with largely reduced network load.",8
icra,None,High-speed gaze controller for millisecond-order pan/tilt camera,"Kohei Okumura,Hiromasa Oku,Masatoshi Ishikawa,","We developed an optical high-speed gaze controller, called the “Saccade Mirror”, and used it to realize a high-speed pan/tilt camera with a high-speed image processor. Generally, in a pan/tilt camera, the gaze is controlled mechanically by rotational actuators. However, because pan/tilt cameras will be expected to use high-speed image processing (≥ 1000 fps), sufficiently high-speed performance of the gaze controller, comparable to the high frame rate, cannot be obtained with the usual method. In our system, the camera itself was fixed, and an external Saccade Mirror subsystem was used for optical gaze control. An arbitrary gaze direction within ±30 deg could be achieved in less than 3.5 ms.",111
icra,None,Active vision-based robot localization and navigation in a visual memory,"Gian Luca Mariottini,Stergios I. Roumeliotis,","We present a new strategy for active vision-based localization and navigation of a mobile robot in a visual memory, i.e., within a previously-visited area represented as a large collection of images. Vision-based localization in such a large and dynamic visual map is intrinsically ambiguous, since more than one map-locations can exhibit the same visual appearance as the current image observed by the robot. Most existing approaches are passive, i.e., they do not devise any strategy to resolve this ambiguity. In this work, we present an active vision-based localization and navigation strategy that can disambiguate the true initial location among possible hypotheses by controlling the mobile observer across a sequence of highly distinctive images, while concurrently navigating towards the target image. The performance of our active localization and navigation algorithm is demonstrated experimentally on a robot moving within a large outdoor environment.",25
icra,None,Biologically-inspired time and location of impact prediction from optical flow,"Chris McCarthy,Giorgio Metta,","We investigated the use of optical flow to predict the time and location of impact of an incoming object. By examining local patterns of optical flow, we make predictions on an object's trajectory with respect to a stationary observer, and its time-to-contact with the observer's (assumed planar) body. Such a cue may serve as inputs to motor responses for reactive threat avoidance, or object interception (such as catching a ball). The presented approach is based on the observed behaviour of neurons in the F4 region of the pre-motor cortex of primates and it is part of a larger project which aims at modelling multi-sensory neurons and their contribution to reaching behaviour on the iCub humanoid platform. We present preliminary experimental results of a computation model of F4's visual responses using real image sequences acquired from the robot, and demonstrate their application in a real-time threat detection/prediction system.",1
icra,None,Visibility learning in large-scale urban environment,"Pablo F. Alcantarilla,Kai Ni,Luis M. Bergasa,Frank Dellaert,","A crucial step in many vision based applications, such as localization and structure from motion, is the data association between a large map of known 3D points and 2D features perceived by a new camera. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the visibility of known 3D points with respect to a query camera in large-scale environments. In our approach, we model the visibility of each 3D point with respect to a camera pose using a memory-based learning algorithm, in which a distance metric between cameras is learned in an entirely non-parametric way. We show that by fully exploiting the geometric relationships between the 3D map and the camera poses, as well as the related appearance information, the resulting prediction is much more robust and efficient than conventional approaches. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a large urban 3D model in terms of both speed and accuracy.",26
icra,None,How-models of human reaching movements in the context of everyday manipulation activities,"Daniel Nyga,Moritz Tenorth,Michael Beetz,","We present a system for learning models of human reaching trajectories in the context of everyday manipulation activities. Different kinds of trajectories are automatically discovered, and each of them is described by its semantic context. In a first step, the system clusters trajectories in observations of human everyday activities based on their shapes, and then learns the relation between these trajectories and the contexts in which they are used. The resulting models can be used for robots to select a trajectory to use in a given context. They can also serve as powerful prediction models for human motions to improve human-robot interaction. Experiments on the TUM kitchen data set show that the method is capable of discovering meaningful clusters in real-world observations of everyday activities like setting a table.",14
icra,None,Self-supervised segmentation of river scenes,"Supreeth Achar,Bharath Sankaran,Stephen Nuske,Sebastian Scherer,,","Here we consider the problem of automatically segmenting images taken from a boat or low-flying aircraft. Such a capability is important for autonomous river following and mapping. The need for accurate segmentation in a wide variety of riverine environments challenges the state of the art vision-based methods that have been used in more structured environments such as roads and highways. Apart from the lack of structure, the principal difficulty is the large spatial and temporal variations in the appearance of water in the presence of nearby vegetation and with reflections from the sky. We propose a self-supervised method to segment images into `sky', `river' and `shore' (vegetation + structures) regions. Our approach uses assumptions about river scene structure to learn appearance models based on features like color, texture and image location which are used to segment the image. We validated our algorithm by testing on four datasets captured under varying conditions on different rivers. Our self-supervised algorithm had higher accuracy rates than a supervised alternative, often significantly more accurate, and does not need to be retrained to work under different conditions.",45
icra,None,Bag of multimodal LDA models for concept formation,"Tomoaki Nakamura,Takayuki Nagai,Naoto Iwahashi,","In this paper a novel framework for multimodal categorization using Bag of multimodal LDA models is proposed. The main issue, which is tackled in this paper, is granularity of categories. The categories are not fixed but varied according to context. Selective attention is the key to model this granularity of categories. This fact motivates us to introduce various sets of weights to the perceptual information. Obviously, as the weights change, the categories vary. In the proposed model, various sets of weights and model structures are assumed. Then the multimodal LDA-based categorization is carried out many times that results in a variety of models. In order to make the categories (concepts) useful for inference, significant models should be selected. The selection process is carried out through the interaction between the robot and the user. These selected models enable the robot to infer unobserved properties of the object. For example, the robot can infer audio information only from its appearance. Furthermore, the robot can describe appearance of any objects using some suitable words, thanks to the connection between words and perceptual information. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a robot platform and preliminary experiment is carried out to validate the proposed algorithm.",37
icra,None,Autonomous learning of vision-based layered object models on mobile robots,"Xiang Li,Mohan Sridharan,Shiqi Zhang,","Although mobile robots are increasingly being used in real-world applications, the ability to robustly sense and interact with the environment is still missing. A key requirement for the widespread deployment of mobile robots is the ability to operate autonomously by learning desired environmental models and revising the learned models in response to environmental changes. This paper presents an approach that enables a mobile robot to autonomously learn layered models for environmental objects using temporal, local and global visual cues. A temporal assessment of image gradient features is used to detect candidate objects, which are then modeled using color distribution statistics and a spatial representation of gradient features. The robot incrementally revises the learned models and uses them for object recognition and tracking based on a matching scheme comprising a spatial similarity measure and second order distribution statistics. All algorithms are implemented and tested on a wheeled robot platform in dynamic indoor environments.",8
icra,None,Towards perceptual shared autonomy for robotic mobile manipulation,"Benjamin Pitzer,Michael Styer,Christian Bersch,Charles DuHadway,,","Reliability and availability are major concerns for autonomous systems. A personal robot has to solve complex tasks, such as loading a dishwasher or folding laundry, which are very difficult to automate robustly. In order for a robot to perform better in those applications, it needs to be capable of accepting help from a human operator. Shared autonomy is a system model based on human-robot dialogue. This work aims at bridging the gap between full human control and full autonomy for tasks in the domain of personal robotics. One of the hardest problems for personal robotic systems is perception: perceiving and inferring about objects in the robot's environment. We present a system capable of solving the perceptual inference in combination with a human, such that a human operator functions as a resource for the robot and helps to compensate for limitations of autonomy. In this paper, we show how a human-robot team can work together effectively to solve complex perception tasks. We present a system that asks a human operator to identify objects it doesn't recognize or find. In various experiments with the PR2 robot we show that this shared autonomy system performs more robustly than the robot system alone and that it is capable of tasks which are difficult to accomplish by an autonomous agent.",70
icra,None,Concept and evaluation of a synergistic controlled robotic instrument for trepanation in neurosurgery,"Alexander Korff,Axel Follmann,Tobias Fürtjes,Daniel Habor,Sandra C. Kunze,,,","A robotic instrument which synergistically cooperates with the surgeon for opening the skull in neurosurgery is proposed. To reduce frequent complications of this intervention, tear of the dura mater and bad reintegration of the skull bone a soft tissue preserving saw is combined with automatic depth regulation on the basis of a priori acquired medical imaging data (CT/MRI). By fusing the individual capabilities of the surgeon and a robotic device, it is possible to design an instrument which is significantly smaller than a fully autonomous system. The acceptance is enhanced by the integration of the surgeon into the process with direct control over the procedure. During the intervention, the instrument is manually guided by the surgeon on a freely defined trajectory. To be able to control this instrument, a method for real-time depth regulation, medical imaging data pre-processing and reduction as well as appropriate interfaces for the surgeon have been developed. In an experimental setup with phantom skull caps the system has been evaluated and has shown promising results, with a mean error of 0.62mm. Future work will include a detailed analysis of the persisting errors, integration of different sensors to control the instrument and preclinical trials.",11
icra,None,An advanced medical robotic system augmenting healthcare capabilities - robotic nursing assistant,"John Hu,Aaron Edsinger,Yi-Je Lim,Nick Donaldson,Mario Solano,,,","A persistent-if less glamorous—challenge in hospitals lies in the day-to-day work of moving and lifting patients with impaired mobility. This is a challenge intensified by our burgeoning aging population, the obesity epidemic, and our aging healthcare workforce. During manual patient handling, the predominant risk of staff injury is excessive back and shoulder loading. A mobile robotic nurse assistant (RoNA) is highly desired to enhance the efficacy and quality of care that nurses and their paraprofessional staff can provide. Such an assistant could improve a nurse's working conditions by off-loading some of his or her most physically demanding duties, thereby reducing the potential for self-injury or injury to the patient. Hstar Technologies is developing a revolutionary RoNA system that provides physical assistance to nurses in a hospital ward. The design of RoNA is a safe and robust system that works effectively in a hospital environment under direct and telepresence control by a nurse or physician. RoNA has a humanoid design featuring bimanual dexterous manipulators that employ a series-elastic-actuation (SEA) system. These electric actuators provide manipulator compliance, safety, flexibility and the strength to lift patients weighing up to 300lbs. RoNA also features an innovative humanoid upper torso, a unique mobile platform with holonomic drive and posture stability enhancement, intelligent navigation control with 3D sensing and perception capability, an intuitive and innovative human-robot interaction control interface, and a highly integrated plan for healthcare system assembly. We anticipate that robotic maneuvering assistants would increase job satisfaction, reduce lifting-related injuries, and extend the years of effective service nurses could render in hospitals. These effects would reduce hospital costs and ameliorate problems posed by the shortage of nursing staff.",83

The system uses the preoperative planning approach that we developed earlier, and integrates it to the intraoperative algorithms for controlling a robot and tracking some specific landmarks of a highly dynamical surgical field. In particular, our late studies presented herein aim to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating appropriate computational tools to achieve the volumetric image guidance for minimally invasive surgeries in the beating heart.

The prostate cancers are firmer than normal tissues. Therefore, physicians can detect the prostate cancer with a palpation. In this paper, we developed a robotic system to detect prostate cancers using robotic palpation to find the suspected area of the tissue as well as to localize the area of the needle biopsy. To validate the performance of the developed system, the experiment on soft tissue phantoms was carried out. The results indicate that the system can identify the differences of tissue phantoms within and without inclusions. In addition, the bigger inclusions and the closer inclusions from the surface show larger value of the force response. These results indicate that the developed robotic system can be used to find hard materials such as tumor and malignant tissue in the prostate.",7

In our previous works, we proposed the method to identify inertial parameters of human body segments in real-time during measurement of motion. However, some obtained parameters are not physically consistent; some masses are negative and inertia tensor matrices are not positive definite. These parameters generate problems in the analysis and the simulation requiring physical consistency.

icra,None,Generic radial distortion calibration of a novel single camera based panoramic stereoscopic system,"Weiming Li,Y. F. Li,Zhongwei Li,D. Sun,Beiwei Zhang,","This work presents a novel panoramic stereoscopic system consisting of a fisheye lens camera and a hyperbolic mirror with co-axis installation. From the overlapping field of view captured through the fisheye lens and the reflection of the mirror, position of an object point in 3D Euclidean space can be reconstructed once the system geometry is calibrated. To deal with the non-single viewpoint issue in the catadioptric image, a generic radial distortion model is used to describe the imaging process with a series of viewing cones. The parameters of the viewing cones are estimated using a homography based method with observations of an LCD panel at a few unknown positions. Following this, a closed form solution for 3D reconstruction is used with a non-linear optimization to obtain an optimal calibration. A prototype of the proposed design is constructed. Quantitative experiments are conducted to evaluate the calibration result in terms of 3D reconstruction precision. With the calibration result, we also present potential robotic applications of the proposed system such as 3D environment reconstruction in a 360 degree horizontal field of view.",3
icra,None,An analytical solution to optimal focal distance in catadioptric imaging systems,"Weiming Li,Y. F. Li,","Catadioptric imaging systems are important in many computer vision and robotics applications. This work addresses the issue of optimally setting the focal distance of a lens based camera in a catadioptric imaging system in order to acquire a best focused image. To this end, understanding the spatial distribution of virtual feature formed by mirror reflection is important. It is known that the virtual features of infinite range of scene depth are limited to a finite depth extent, which is named a caustic volume. In this work we further find that for a variety of quadric mirror based catadioptric systems, when the objects are located at a certain distance to the system, the corresponding virtual features can be considered to be located on the caustic volume boundary. We verify this property with real catadioptric images. Based on this property, an analytical solution is derived for the optimal focal distance setting, which can only be calculated by software simulation or numerical approaches in previous work. This solution is compared with a numerical solution of previous method and is also verified by a simulation of the optical process.",3

A novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) is developed for precise control of the plate point's final temperature (FT) with fast computational speed. The control objective of time-temperature curve (plate temperature evolution) is converted into a space distribution of plate temperature along cooling line, which simplifies the ACC model to a linear model then does beneficial to employ MPC directly for optimizing the FT of plate points. The predictive horizon and control horizon of MPC is reduced to one or two sample time since the space distribution of plate temperature contains the future information of plate point's temperature, then dramatically reduce the computational burden.

icra,None,System identification of fractional order dynamic models for electrochemical systems,"Ming Su,Ran Niu,Yi Zheng,","Fractional order differential equations (FODE) provides a more flexible approach to describe dynamic systems. However, the extra flexibility poses a difficult problem in system identification, which requires not only the estimation of model coefficients but also the determination of fractional orders. They are coupled nonlinearly. In addition, the model coefficients in a FODE are shown nonlinearly coupled with respect to the often used Sum Squared Error (SSE) objective function. In this article, a two-layer approach is designed to estimate fractional orders and model coefficients iteratively. An intermediate step that estimates model coefficients is also introduced to address the nonlinear coupling of coefficients in a SSE. In the subsequent simulation for electrochemical systems, it is found that prior knowledge on physical systems being modeled is necessary to create optimization constraints and justify the results.",4

As a result, we can detect millimetric defects of 0.3mm diameter or greater with different shapes which were very hard to detect with existing technology without that phenomena. The project has generated two PTC patents, the first one protects the defect augmentation phenomena, while the second protects the industrial system itself. The main innovation of this industrial project is the development of a system that improves in almost 100% the human inspection.

icra,None,A practical algorithm for robot path planning with imprecise environmental dimensions,"Guanfeng Liu,","Robot path planning problem arises in a variety of industrial application scenarios. In manufacturing automation, we often require a robot to quickly go to its home position from a given initial point while avoiding possible collisions with the environment. In hard disk drive testing, fast recovery following from a robot failure, for example, a motion stop or robot gripper sensor failure, is desired in order to reduce manual intervening and improve production efficiency. In the academic field, under the assumption that the environment dimension is completely known, the robot path planning problem has been solved theoretically using either the complete methods, or the probabilistic algorithms. However, in industrial fields, most commonly used path planning algorithms are still empirical, and are often based on human intuition. There is still a big gap between the state-of-the-art path planning techniques that are already developed in the academic field and the methods used in the industrial fields. This paper reports a practical approach for path planning with an intention to bridge the gap. This approach constructs a set of collision-free milestones iteratively, which gives rise to a partition of robot configuration space such that the collision-free portion of each cell is star-shaped. Then it is straightforward to draw a collision-free path from a point in robot configuration space to one of the collision-free milestones as well as constructing and verifying paths among these milestones.",3

When robots become capable to perform sensor-guided and sensor-guarded motions, there is no predefined path anymore, and motions have to be calculated online, that is, during the motion. The Reflexxes Motion Libraries calculate jerk-limited motions within one control cycle only (typically 1 ms or less). This way, robots can instantaneously react to unforeseen sensor events, which opens the door to a huge number of new robot capabilities and fundamentally new motion control features.

All these features are important for the execution of sensor-based robot motions and to realize new applications as will be outlined in this paper.",115
icra,None,Evaluation of attachment and motion of bacteria-driven liposome based on antibody binding technique,"Seiichi Ikeda,Zhenhai Zhang,Masaru Kojima,Masahiro Nakajima,,","Toward to realizing a novel drug delivery system, a simulation system is considered to be important for a future analysis of it. In this paper, a novel, miniature, and energy-efficient bio-mimetic propulsion concept was proposed. The antibody binding technique is developed and used to attach bacteria to liposome's surface for enhancing liposome mobility. Bacteria and liposome are strongly combined through antibody. Consequently, the effect of antibody when bacteria attached to liposome is studied experimentally. The stochastic nature of bacterial propulsion of liposome is investigated experimentally and analytically. It is shown that antibody plays an important role in attaching bacteria to liposome and the liposome with bacteria moved broader compared to the liposome without bacteria. Statistical calculation matches well with experimental data.",0
icra,None,Four and two wheel transformable dynamic mobile platform,"Dongil Choi,Jun-ho Oh,","In this paper, we developed a novel dynamic mobile platform capable of transforming between four wheel rapid driving mode with ZMP stabilization and two wheel balancing mode. Usually, the four wheel mobile platforms have low acceleration due to the high center of mass. Using the feed-forward ZMP stabilization method, we achieved high acceleration performance with maintaining stable ZMP. We use a LQR controller for two wheel balancing mode. In the two wheel balancing mode, there are two different driving modes, self-balancing mode, human-riding mode. The transformation between four wheel and two wheel mode is made possible by swing up and swing down control method. We prove the dynamic performance of mobile platform by experimental results.",7

icra,None,Air-ground multi-agent robot team coordination,"Cai Luo,Andre Possani Espinosa,Alessandro De Gloria,Roberto Sgherri,","In an indoor search and rescue mission, the two main tasks are detecting the location of survivors or broken equipments and recovering them from a building full of danger. For the outdoor robots, they can use GPS to get the path information. But in a GPS-denied environment, the robots cannot get the support from satellites. We design an air-ground robot team to provide a solution to this problem.

Experimental results are presented demonstrating this air-ground robot team's ability to operate successfully in indoor environments.",11
icra,None,Using advanced industrial robotics for spacecraft Rendezvous and Docking simulation,"Toralf Boge,Ou Ma,","One of the most challenging and risky missions for spacecraft is to perform Rendezvous and Docking (RvD) autonomously in space. To ensure a safe and reliable operation, such a mission must be carefully designed and thoroughly verified before a real space mission can be launched.

icra,None,Terramechanics evaluation of low-pressure wheel on deformable terrain,"Shinichiro Narita,Masatsugu Otsuki,Sachiko Wakabayashi,Shinichiro Nishida,","In this paper new procedures for the measurement of mobility parameters, such as contact pressure, and an analysis of a low-pressure wheel model on deformable terrain, are presented. Because the lunar surface is covered by regolith which implies an irregular and rough terrain, the rover has difficulty in moving. Therefore a new low-pressure wheel is recommended for high mobility performance and low power consumption with a less complex mechanism. A low-pressure wheel can change its contact shape and pressure distribution to account for terrain. The presented measurement is achieved by a new measurement instrument on the wheel, and we presented analysis model is conducted through analysis of terramechanics mobility dynamics of a low-pressure wheel with normal stress. These procedures are valuable for evaluating the longitudinal velocity of the low-pressure wheel on deformable terrain.",4
icra,None,Modeling and identification of electric double-layer supercapacitors,"Ran Niu,Hai Yang,","Supercapacitors are emerging new devices for many applications, either as main energy sources or as energy buffers, due to their high power density. To study possible applications of supercapacitors, a terminal model describing the dynamic behavior of supercapacitors is required. In this paper, a simple electrical equivalent circuit model (ECM) is proposed based on the conventional supercapacitor RC branches model. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization algorithm is presented to identify the model parameters. The proposed modeling and identification method was validated with supercapacitor experimental results.

icra,None,Analysis and compensation for the dynamic error of the FPD glass substrates transfer robot,"Yalei Feng,Daokui Qu,Fang Xu,Hongguang Wang,XiaoDong Su,","High-generation FPD (Flat Panel Display) glass substrates need to be carried by large clean transfer robot. Due to the space of the deposited glass box is limited, the distance between the two substrates is very small, this requires the sag amount of the robot fork must be controlled within a certain range. The traditional design is completed only in robot manufacturing stage by adding a shim to compensate for this distortion, but this method can only make the fork be compensated at a determined location, deformation at other locations may not be considered. A new solution to the dynamic compensation for the robot fork is proposed. By establishing the robot FEA model and mechanism accuracy model respectively, the synthetic dynamic error is then obtained. One can just change the mechanism accuracy through rational allocation of design tolerances of the robot links to minimize the dynamic error.",1
