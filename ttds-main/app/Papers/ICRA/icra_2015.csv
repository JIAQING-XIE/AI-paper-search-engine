The Robot Swarm exhibit allows visitors to program behaviors and interact with a “swarm” of small robots. The exhibit supports extended unattended run times, continuous interaction with the public and the demonstration of evocative group behaviors. The exhibit software includes a robust collision avoidance scheme that prevents collisions between robots and collisions between robots and static obstructions in the exhibit space. This system was achieved by building on the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm in a novel implementation: the Extended Velocity Obstacle validation system. This paper presents: 1) A collision avoidance algorithm that robustly and efficiently avoids collisions between many robots and static obstacles. 2) A unique hybrid ORCA collision avoidance approach that utilizes global state knowledge without subverting the behavioral independence of each robot. 3) A unique position filtering system which is tailored to an error model in which positions reads can be treated as “ground-truth” and a noise model that is highly discontinuous and non-linear. We present experiments and experimental data that demonstrate the efficacy of our approach."

Applying an electric field to a mobile robot's direct environment and measuring perturbations of this field, one is able to detect the presence of foreign objects in close proximity of the system. In addition, one is also able to infer a range of information relative to the detected objects, such as their position or electrical characteristics. Extracting such information from available measures typically requires a model (analytical, numerical or heuristic) descriptive of the relationship from geometry of the scene to measures performed (typically referred to as forward model), or of the inverse relationship (inverse model). In the following, we directly extract one such model from experimental data, and capture a forward model using a neural formalism. Then, using an iterative procedure, we are able to estimate the position of a detected object and assess the degree of confidence one can place on this estimate. Merit of the approach is illustrated using experimental data for a spherical object."

Vera,G. Heredia,A. Ollero,","This paper proposes a method called Segmentation-adaptive Pseudospectral collocation to address the problem of safe trajectory generation in missions with cooperating multiple aerial vehicles. Pseudospectral collocation can generate optimized collision-free trajectories, but for multiple aerial vehicles it cannot guarantee that the safety separation distance is maintained in the whole trajectories, since the constraints are only enforced in discrete points in the trajectory (collocation points). Hp-adaptive pseudospectral collocation increases iteratively the number of collocation points and the degree of the approximating polynomial, but this may lead to an exponential increase of the computational load. The proposed method solves the problem by selectively adding new collocation points where they are needed, only in the segments with conflicts in each iteration, thus effectively reducing the number of collocation points and the computation time with respect to other pseudospectral collocation formulations. The proposed method allows both changes of speed and changes of heading for each aerial vehicle to guarantee the safety distance between them. Its computational load and scalability are studied in randomly generated scenarios. Moreover, a comparison with other method is presented. Several experiments to test the validity of the approach have been also carried out in the multivehicle aerial testbed of the Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies."

We create a virtual obstacle at the mean position of the robots. A control is be designed such that each robot will avoid the closest obstacle when a collision is possible. The closest obstacle can be the virtual obstacle or the nearest robot. We present two such control laws. The first assumes perfect knowledge of the velocities of all nearby robots and can allow a saturated velocity input for each robot. In practice, the velocities of the other robots are hard to measure or estimate precisely. Therefore, the second control law removes the assumption of known velocities based on a high-gain, robust control scheme. We prove the first control scheme is globally asymptotically stable, and the robust control law is globally uniformly ultimately bounded. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, Monte Carlo simulations and experiments have been conducted."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7138978,Efficient mixed-integer planning for UAVs in cluttered environments,"Robin Deits,Russ Tedrake,","We present a new approach to the design of smooth trajectories for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are free of collisions with obstacles along their entire length. To avoid the non-convex constraints normally required for obstacle-avoidance, we perform a mixed-integer optimization in which polynomial trajectories are assigned to convex regions which are known to be obstacle-free. Prior approaches have used the faces of the obstacles themselves to define these convex regions. We instead use IRIS, a recently developed technique for greedy convex segmentation [1], to pre-compute convex regions of safe space. This results in a substantially reduced number of integer variables, which improves the speed with which the optimization can be solved to its global optimum, even for tens or hundreds of obstacle faces. In addition, prior approaches have typically enforced obstacle avoidance at a finite set of sample or knot points. We introduce a technique based on sums-of-squares (SOS) programming that allows us to ensure that the entire piecewise polynomial trajectory is free of collisions using convex constraints. We demonstrate this technique in 2D and in 3D using a dynamical model in the Drake toolbox for Matlab [2]."

While other systems exist that do high-level mapping and 3D path planning for obstacle avoidance, most of these systems require high-powered CPUs on-board or off-board control from a ground station. We present a novel entirely on-board approach, leveraging a light-weight low power stereo vision system on FPGA. Our approach runs at a frame rate of 60 frames a second on VGA-sized images and minimizes latency between image acquisition and performing reactive maneuvers, allowing MAVs to fly more safely and robustly in complex environments. We also suggest our system as a light-weight safety layer for systems undertaking more complex tasks, like mapping the environment. Finally, we show our algorithm implemented on a lightweight, very computationally constrained platform, and demonstrate obstacle avoidance in a variety of environments."

Kim,","We present a novel algorithm to compute a gradient-continuous penetration depth (PhongPD) between two interpenetrated polygonal models. Our penetration depth (PD) formulation ensures separating the intersected models by translation, and the amount of such translation is close to an optimal motion to resolve interpenetration in most cases. In order to achieve the gradient-continuity in our algorithm, we interpolate tangent planes continuously over the contact space and then perform a projection along a normal direction defined by the interpolated tangent planes; this projection scheme is known as Phong projection. We have implemented our PhongPD algorithm and certifies its continuity using three benchmarks consisting of diverse combinatorial complexities, and show that our algorithm shows smoother PD results than a conventional Euclidean-projection-based PD method."

By introducing time as an additional dimension to the robot's workspace, the method is able to quickly evaluate time-indexed candidate trajectories for collision with the known future motions of other agents. The approach makes no assumptions on the shape of the objects and is able to handle arbitrary motions. We highlight implementation details regarding the application of the collision detection technique within an online planning framework for automated driving. Furthermore, we give detailed profiling information to show the capability for real-time operation."

While a number of methods have been proposed to robustly predict future motions of humans, it still remains as a difficult problem in the presence of measurement noises. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a structured low-rank matrix approximation method using nuclear-norm regularized l 1 -norm minimization in AR-GP for robust motion prediction of dynamic obstacles. The proposed method approximates a kernel matrix by finding an orthogonal basis using low-rank symmetric positive semi-definite matrix approximation assuming that a kernel matrix can be well represented by a small number of dominating basis vectors. The proposed method is suitable for predicting the motion of a pedestrian, such that it can be used for safe autonomous robot navigation in a crowded environment. The proposed method is applied to well-known regression and motion prediction problems to demonstrate its robustness and excellent performance compared to existing approaches."

Recently, scene understanding approaches based on 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation have become popular, but existing methods either do not scale, fail outdoors, provide only sparse reconstructions or are rather slow. In this paper, we build on a recent hash-based technique for large-scale fusion and an efficient mean-field inference algorithm for densely-connected CRFs to present what to our knowledge is the first system that can perform dense, large-scale, outdoor semantic reconstruction of a scene in (near) real time. We also present a `semantic fusion' approach that allows us to handle dynamic objects more effectively than previous approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the KITTI dataset, and provide qualitative and quantitative results showing high-quality dense reconstruction and labelling of a number of scenes."

Guerrero,","In this paper we present a dense visual odometry system for RGB-D cameras performing both photometric and geometric error minimisation to estimate the camera motion between frames. Contrary to most works in the literature, we parametrise the geometric error by the inverse depth instead of the depth, which translates into a better fit of the distribution of the geometric error to the used robust cost functions. We also provide a unified evaluation under the same framework of different estimators and ways of computing the scale of the residuals which can be found spread along the related literature. For the comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art approaches we use the popular dataset from the TUM for RGB-D benchmarking. Our approach shows to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of drift in meters per second, even compared to methods performing loop closure too. When comparing to approaches performing pure odometry like ours, our method outperforms them in the majority of the tested datasets. Additionally we show that our approach is able to work in real time and we provide a qualitative evaluation on our own sequences showing a low drift in the 3D reconstructions."

Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Navigation [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an environment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experiences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations - which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited computational resources. We demonstrate and evaluate our system over three challenging datasets, totalling 206km of outdoor travel. We demonstrate the system in a diverse range of lighting and weather conditions, scene clutter, camera occlusions, and permanent structural change in the environment."

It is based on a variational formulation where brightness constancy and geometric consistency are imposed. Accounting for the depth data provided by RGB-D cameras, regularization of the flow field is imposed on the 3D surface (or set of surfaces) of the observed scene instead of on the image plane, leading to more geometrically consistent results. The minimization problem is efficiently solved by a primal-dual algorithm which is implemented on a GPU, achieving a previously unseen temporal performance. Several tests have been conducted to compare our approach with a state-of-the-art work (RGB-D flow) where quantitative and qualitative results are evaluated. Moreover, an additional set of experiments have been carried out to show the applicability of our work to estimate motion in real-time. Results demonstrate the accuracy of our approach, which outperforms the RGB-D flow, and which is able to estimate heterogeneous and non-rigid motions at a high frame rate."

Still many state of the art algorithms proposed to date are unable to reasonably handle high resolution images due to their run time complexities or memory requirements. In this work we propose a novel stereo correspondence estimation algorithm that employs binary locality sensitive hashing and is well suited to implementation on the GPU. Our proposed method is capable of processing very high-resolution stereo images at near real-time rates. An evaluation on the new Middlebury and Disney high-resolution stereo benchmarks demonstrates that our proposed method performs well compared to existing state of the art algorithms.

The system runs on an on-board smartphone processor and requires only the input of a single downlooking camera and an inertial measurement unit. We generate a two-dimensional elevation map that is probabilistic, of fixed size, and robot-centric, thus, always covering the area immediately underneath the robot. The elevation map is continuously updated at a rate of 1 Hz with depth maps that are triangulated from multiple views using recursive Bayesian estimation. To highlight the usefulness of the proposed mapping framework for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles, we successfully demonstrate fully autonomous landing including landing-spot detection in real-world experiments."

As such, we extend DART, an existing visual articulated object tracker, to additionally avoid interpenetration of multiple interacting objects, and to make use of contact information collected via torque sensors or touch sensors. To achieve greater stability, the tracker uses a switching model to detect when an object is stationary relative to the table or relative to the palm and then uses information from multiple frames to converge to an accurate and stable estimate. Deviation from stable states is detected in order to remain robust to failed grasps and dropped objects. The tracker is integrated into a shared autonomy system in which it provides state estimates used by a grasp planner and the controller of two anthropomorphic hands. We demonstrate the advantages and performance of the tracking system in simulation and on a real robot. Qualitative results are also provided for a number of challenging manipulations that are made possible by the speed, accuracy, and stability of the tracking system."

García,Simone Frintrop,Bastian Leibe,","In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating generic object candidates for object discovery and recognition in continuous monocular video. Such candidates have recently become a popular alternative to exhaustive window-based search as basis for classification. Contrary to previous approaches, we address the candidate generation problem at the level of entire video sequences instead of at the single image level. We propose a processing pipeline that starts from individual region candidates and tracks them over time. This enables us to group candidates for similar objects and to automatically filter out inconsistent regions. For generating the per-frame candidates, we introduce a novel multi-scale saliency approach that achieves a higher per-frame recall with fewer candidates than current state-of-the-art methods. Taken together, those two components result in a significant reduction of the number of object candidates compared to frame level methods, while keeping a consistently high recall."

We propose a surface inpainting solution through energy minimisation with an adaptive selection of surface regularisers among a set of well known convex and non-convex regularisers. In fact, the selection of norm is pivotal with respect to the intrinsic surface characteristics. Our goal is to show how dense interpolation of sparse range data can be leveraged of more exotic and non-convex regularisers such as the log and logTGV [1] which can better capture the scene geometry. In contrast to state of the art solutions, we do not restrict ourselves to this set of norms, instead we search for the most apt norm for each semantically segmented part of the scene. Our energy model selection use Bayesian optimisation to learn the best choice of free parameters. This results in an adaptive model selection and the generalisation of well studied regularisation norms. We conclude with a detailed experimental analysis of our approach using a basis of four norms over a set of challenging outdoor scenes."

Among the existing manipulation techniques, the method of magnetic force based manipulation exhibits great advantages for its minimally-invasive feature and insensitivity to biological substance, making it ideally suitable to in vivo environment. On the other hand, increasing demand for accurate and high throughput magnetic manipulation highlights the need of incorporating automation technology in the manipulation. In this paper, we propose an automated control approach to manipulating a magnetic microparticle (bead) with a home-designed electromagnetic coil system. A simplified two-order dynamic model for a microparticle suspended in fluidic environment is established first. A closed-loop controller with utilizing visual feedback is then developed based on input-to-state stability and backstepping methodology. The proposed controller guarantees that the microparticle follows the desired trajectory even in presence of environmental uncertainties and disturbances. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Abbott,","This is the first demonstration of a modular and reconfigurable magnetic-manipulation system with integral ferromagnetic material. This system-which includes multiple Omnimagnets, each comprising three orthogonal solenoids and a spherical ferromagnetic core-is capable of dexterous manipulation of a magnetic tool. The magnetization coupling of an arbitrary arrangement of spherical ferromagnetic cores is solved, enabling an analytical solution for the magnetic forces and torques. Thus, the system does not require extensive field maps or in situ field characterization. If the positions and orientations of the Omnimagnets are sensed, the Omnimagnets can be actively rearranged during manipulation while maintaining control of the tool. This could enable new capabilities in medical procedures because the manipulation system can be modified to accommodate the imaging systems and enable physician access without loss of control. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated through five-degree-of-freedom manipulation (position and heading) of a permanent-magnetic tool with several arbitrary Omnimagnet configurations."

However, current motion skill learning methods typically restrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting its expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently developed policy search method [1] and use it to learn a range of dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations, without using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set of trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted time-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single control policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to run on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample count and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire fast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn robust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy airplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto tight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and screwing bottle caps onto bottles."

Performance of the proposed framework is validated with simulation of a ROV (remotely operated vehicle) manipulator system and some preliminary user studies."

Bechlioulis,George C. Karras,,","This paper addresses the problem of cooperative object transportation by two nonholonomic wheeled robots, with the coordination relying exclusively on implicit communication. We implement a leader-follower scheme, considering compliant contact between the object and the follower. Only the leader has knowledge of the object's goal configuration. The follower employs force/torque measurements to keep the contact stable and align itself with the object. The control scheme of the follower is based on the prescribed performance methodology guaranteeing thus the satisfaction of certain predefined force/torque constraints. In this way, the overall system acts as a perturbed version of the nominal car-like model. As a result, the leader implements a discontinuous control scheme, that drives robustly the system arbitrarily close to the goal configuration. No explicit data is exchanged among the robots, thus reducing bandwidth and increasing robustness and stealthiness. Finally, the proposed method is experimentally validated using two Pioneer mobile robots interconnected with a rod."

Lee,Henry Lu,Abhishek Gupta,Sergey Levine,Pieter Abbeel,","Manipulation of deformable objects often requires a robot to apply specific forces to bring the object into the desired configuration. For instance, tightening a knot requires pulling on the ends, flattening an article of clothing requires smoothing out wrinkles, and erasing a whiteboard requires applying downward pressure. We present a method for learning force-based manipulation skills from demonstrations. Our approach uses non-rigid registration to compute a warping function that transforms both the end-effector poses and forces in each demonstration into the current scene, based on the configuration of the object. Our method then uses the variation between the demonstrations to extract a single trajectory, along with time-varying feedback gains that determine how much to match poses or forces. This results in a learned variable-impedance control strategy that trades off force and position errors, providing for the right level of compliance that applies the necessary forces at each stage of the motion. We evaluate our approach by tying knots in rope, flattening towels, and erasing a whiteboard."

Paul Siebert,","We present a visually guided, dual-arm, industrial robot system that is capable of autonomously flattening garments by means of a novel visual perception pipeline that fully interprets high-quality RGB-D images of a clothing scene based on an active stereo robot head. A segmented clothing range map is B-Spline smoothed prior to being parsed by means of shape and topology analysis into ‘wrinkle’ structures. The length, width and height of each wrinkle is used to quantify the topology of each wrinkle and thereby rank wrinkles by size such that a greedy algorithm can identify the largest wrinkle present. A flattening plan optimised for the largest detected wrinkle is formulated based on dual-arm manipulation. We report the validation of our autonomous flattening behaviour and observe that dual-arm flattening requires significantly fewer manipulation iterations than single-arm flattening. Our experimental results also reveal that the flattening process is heavily influenced by the quality of the RGB-D sensor: use of a custom off-the-shelf high-resolution stereo-based sensor system outperformed a commercial low-resolution kinect-like camera in terms of required flattening iterations."

We formulate the search for such configurations as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Collision constraints in an operation and transfer constraints between operations determine the sets of feasible robot configurations. We show that solving the connected constraint graph with off-the-shelf CSP algorithms can quickly become infeasible even for a few sequential assembly operations. We present an algorithm which, through the assumption of feasible regrasps, divides the CSP into independent smaller problems that can be solved exponentially faster. The algorithm then uses local search techniques to improve this solution by removing a gradually increasing number of regrasps from the plan. The algorithm enables the user to stop the planner anytime and use the current best plan if the cost of removing regrasps from the plan exceeds the cost of executing those regrasps. We present simulation experiments to compare our algorithm's performance to a naive algorithm which directly solves the connected constraint graph. We also present a real robot system which uses the output of our planner to grasp and bring parts together in assembly configurations."

For many surgical applications, the DCM may need to operate with much larger curvatures than what current shape sensing methods can detect. This paper proposes a novel shape sensor, which can detect a radius of curvature of 15 mm for a 35 mm long DCM. For this purpose, we used FBG sensors along with nitinol wires as the supporting substrates to form a triangular cross section. For verification, we assembled the sensor inside the wall of the DCM. Experimental results indicate that the proposed sensor can detect the DCM's curvature with an average error of 3.14%."

Kermani,Rajni V. Patel,","In our previous work [1], the potential benefits of Magneto-Rheological Fluid based actuators to the field of haptics were studied. Our results showed that the superior mechanical attributes of such actuators contribute to improvement of stability and transparency in haptic devices. To this end, a novel design of a small-scale MRF-based clutch, was proposed in [1]. This paper reports on the development and validation of the proposed MRF-based clutch. In addition, a closed-loop torque control strategy is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme comes from the magnetic field measurement and is used to compensate for the nonlinear behavior using an estimated model, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Such a control strategy eliminates the need for torque sensors for providing feedback signals. The performance of the developed design and the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control techniques are experimentally validated. The results clearly demonstrate that the clutch shows great potential for use in a multiple degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interface for a class of medical applications."

Denninger,J-S. Plante,","Replacing aircraft hydraulic actuators with ElectroMechanical Actuators (EMAs) is seen as a necessary step towards the development of safer and more efficient aircraft with minimal environmental impact. EMAs are commonly used in a wide range of applications as they have improved efficiency over hydraulic actuators. However, in their current form, EMAs do not comply with the stringent weight and reliability requirements of primary flight control applications. This paper describes an Active Torque Distribution (ATD) system that could meet flight control reliability requirements, be lightweight, and increase the dynamic performance of current flight controls. The proposed ATD system uses magneto-rheological clutches to modulate the torque transferred from a centralized velocity source to various control surfaces. The fundamental advantage of this approach is found in the fluidic nature of magneto-rheological clutch interfaces which transmit torque without any solid mechanical contact thus preventing wear and failure causing mechanical seizure. The analytical study used to scale an ATD system and an analogue EMA system based on a representative flight control application shows that the proposed ATD system is 42% lighter than a system composed of EMAs and has a weight similar to that of current hydraulic actuators. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that ATD systems add ~100x less inertia to flight surfaces than EMAs allowing implementation of load alleviation control algorithms requiring high frequency motion (~30 Hz). A proof-of-concept clutch and controller confirm the analytical predictions and validate the possibility of using magneto-rheological clutches for flight control actuation."

Garces,","The high stiffness of conventional robots is beneficial in attaining highly accurate positioning in free space. High stiffness, however, limits a robot's ability to perform constrained manipulation. Because of the high stiffness, geometric conflict between the robot and task constraints during constrained manipulation can lead to excessive forces and task failure. Variable stiffness actuators can be used to adjust the stiffness of robot joints to allow high stiffness in unconstrained directions and low stiffness in constrained directions. Two important design criteria for variable stiffness actuation are a large range of stiffness and a compact size. A new design, the Arched Flexure VSA, uses a cantilevered beam flexure of variable cross-section and a controllable load location. It allows the joint to have continuously variable stiffness within a finite stiffness range, have zero stiffness for a small range of joint motion, and allow rapid adjustment of stiffness. Using finite element analysis, flexure geometry was optimized to achieve high stiffness in a compact size. A proof-of-concept prototype demonstrated continuously variable stiffness with a ratio of high stiffness to low stiffness of 55."

It uses only one linear spring and has a simple design but its compactness is limited by the spring. For this reason a MACCEPA utilizing torsion spiral springs was designed, reducing the planar dimensions of the actuator. Torsion spiral springs are placed around the joint axis, allowing a more compact VSA in comparison to previous designs. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first VSA based on torsion springs. This paper firstly presents the design of the actuator as the static equations and secondly discusses the design and production of the torsion spiral springs. The newly presented actuator is built and experiments are conducted to validate the model and feasibility of the torsion MACCEPA."

Most existing self-adjustable actuators are bulky and mechanically complex, which often makes their implementation challenging. In this work, we propose a novel passively-adjustable transmission mechanism based on a twisted string actuator. Twisted string actuator is a light, cheap, and mechanically simple actuator, in which twisted strings contract as a result of twisting and therefore act as a translational gear. If one introduces a physical offset between the twisted strings, this changes a ratio between the speed and output force provided by actuator. This work introduces a kinematical model of such actuator for the configuration when a physical offset between the strings is present. In order to experimentally verify the proposed mathematical model, we designed and manufactured a twisted string actuator with variable offsets between the strings. Additionally, in this paper we also propose an idea for passively adjustable gear, controlled by twisted string actuator according to the proposed kinematical model. The main advantages of the proposed passively adjustable gear are its light weight, compliancy and mechanical simplicity, which make it attractive for implementaion in various areas of haptics, teleoperation, wearable and lightweight robotics."

Burkhardt,Faranak Davoodi,Joel W. Burdick,","Moball is a wind-driven spherical robot equipped with sensors for in-situ observation of scientifically important and windy environments, e.g., the Earth's polar regions, Mars, and Saturn's moon Titan. More importantly, Moball incorporates an internal triaxial set of linear electromagnetic generators which can be used to harvest wind energy for long-duration self-sustained operation, or to bias its' wind-driven motions as a form of steering. This paper describes our process to optimize the design of a coreless tubular linear generator for Moball so as to improve energy generation and motion control capabilities with the minimal moving generator mass. The performance of three different types of movers was analyzed with the help of finite element analysis. We determined a final optimized structure and its' dimensions involving a single dipole PM and novel slope-shaped back-irons. A prototype of a single-axis linear generator with a length of 0.8 m was fabricated and assembled. Drop and rotating tests were performed to measure the generated power with this machine. The maximum generated power in the rotating test was 1.05 W at 19 rpm when the load resistance was 40 Ω. The experimental results agreed well with our model predictions. The paper concludes with an overview of the current Moball prototype and ongoing work. The design process developed in this paper can serve as a guideline for future design of energy scavenging systems for robots."

However, so far this material technology is not yet explored in robotics. The introduction of these materials in robotics will potentially reduce the over-dimensioning of current robotic systems, leading to lighter systems and eventually to more efficient designs. Compliant elements used in next generation soft robots, can be constructed from available SH-materials, making them able to autonomously heal cuts and perforations caused by sharp objects in unstructured environments. In addition, the use of SH-materials will have a beneficial impact on the life span of robotic components, reducing the required maintenance drastically. This paper presents the innovative concept of implementing a SH-mechanism in compliant actuators, using dynamic covalent polymer network systems based on the reversible Diels-Alder (DA) reaction. For two entirely different compliant actuators, a series elastic actuator (SEA) and a soft pneumatic actuator (SPA), an analysis is presented on the integration of the DA-polymers in the actuator designs. For both actuator types, a prototype was designed, developed and validated."

Schorr,Ilana Nisky,William R. Provancher,,","When a person interacts with an environment using a tool, he/she receives tactile information in the form of fingerpad skin deformation. Different interaction forces and torques on the tool cause different skin deformation patterns on the fingerpads. We designed a 6-degree-of-freedom tactile device that creates similar skin deformation patterns on the fingerpads. The device communicates force and torque information by translating and rotating skin deformation tactors relative to the fingerpads. An experiment was conducted to determine participants' ability to use skin deformation tactile cues to perform a peg-in-hole insertion task. Results show that participants can use the tactile cues to reduce interaction force and torque, and they use the tactile force cues to reduce interaction force more than they use the tactile torque cues to reduce interaction torque. Rendering force and torque cues simultaneously causes device saturation and degrades user performance. These results suggest that additional training may help participants use the skin deformation torque cues, and motivate a tactile device design that decouples force and torque skin deformation rendering to minimize device saturation. Fingerpad skin deformation is a promising form of tactile feedback to convey force and torque information in teleoperation systems such as robot-assisted surgery, where force feedback may be undesirable due to stability and safety concerns."

Okamura,","Robotic systems, such as prosthetics and exoskeletons, offer people suffering from motor impairments a chance to regain lost physical functionality. However, the neural control that individuals are able to exert over these robots is currently limited. This is due to both lack of control authority in many degrees of freedom and insufficient sensory feedback through the human-robot interface. We propose that haptic feedback is paramount for accurate and efficient control of robots via brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Skin stretch at the fingertip is a novel form of haptic feedback for improving BCI-based robot control. In this paper, we describe the design of a BCI-driven skin-stretch device, assess several control paradigms for this device, and evaluate its effectiveness in a small user study. We show that BCI-based movement-intent classification improved in the presence of skin-stretch feedback for 3 of 4 healthy individuals controlling a computer cursor via an inexpensive, commercial electroencephalography-based (EEG) BCI."

In this paper, we extended our previous configuration-based optimization approach to simulate the six Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) haptic interaction process of tooth extraction. A multi-phase model was proposed to simulate progressive changes of the connection strength between the target tooth and its surrounding gingiva. An energy accumulation model was proposed to compute the small-scale rotation and translation of the target tooth under active forces from a dental forceps. The proposed approach could support training of coordinated force and motion control skill required for tooth extraction.

However, passivity has been suffering from its intrinsic conservatism since it only represents a small set of the whole stable region. Therefore, there was always limitation to increase the performance due to the small design margin from the passivity criterion. In most of the cases, stability and performance has trade-off relationship. In this paper, we propose a less conservative control approach for stable haptic interaction based on Input to State Stable (ISS) criterion. The proposed approach is inspired from the analogy between virtual environments and systems with hysteresis nonlinearities. A system with hysteresis nonlinearity has sector bounded property, which allows us to guarantee that only a finite amount of energy can be extracted from the system, which leads the system to be dissipative [1] and also the states to be bounded by a function of the input [2]. Since the finite amount of energy is allowed to be extracted from the system, the proposed ISS approach has less conservative constraint compared with passivity-based approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach has a simple structure and does not use any system parameters which make it suitable for practical implementations. Experimental evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Advantageously, encounter-type interfaces collide with fingers and display interaction forces only if a contact occurs in the virtual environment. In free space, their end-effectors are mechanically detached from the operator and closely track his fingers, allowing for a perfect transparency. This paper introduces a control scheme that handles the transition between tracking and force display modes in a smooth way. Experimental results using a custom encounter-type interface are also given. The obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed control law when compared to the conventional switch-based control usually found in the literature."

It is our goal to make robots feel more human-like, in the hopes of allowing more natural human-robot interactions. In this paper, we examine a novel biologically-inspired control method, emulating antagonistic muscle pairs based on a nonlinear Hill model. The controller captures the muscle properties and dynamics and is driven solely by muscle activation levels. A human-robot experiment compares this approach to PD and PID controllers with equivalent impedances as well as to direct human-human interactions. The results show the promise of driving motors like muscles and allowing users to experience robots much like humans."

For a robot hand to manually explore the environment or perform a manipulation task such as grasping, sensing of shear forces and detecting incipient slip is important. In this paper, we introduce a method of sensing the normal, shear and torsional load on the contact surface with a GelSight tactile sensor [1]. In addition, we demonstrate the detection of incipient slip. The method consists of inferring the state of the contact interface based on analysis of the sequence of images of GelSights elastomer medium, whose deformation under the external load indicates the conditions of contact. Results with a robot gripper like experimental setup show that the method is effective in detecting interactions with an object during stable grasp as well as at incipient slip. The method is also applicable to other optical based tactile sensors."

The lack of space in the atomic industry, on oil platforms and in space applications demands additional adaptations to current robotic setups. In this paper a MMSS (Multi-Master-Single-Slave) haptic teleoperation system is proposed through which one operator using two master arms can manipulate objects in a cooperative way via one slave robot and a virtual gripping point. To ease the execution of a peg-in-hole task of big objects, a task allocation in the cartesian frame of the virtual gripping point is introduced additionally. The stability of this multilateral system with time delay is guaranteed by the Time Domain Passivity Approach. Therefore the system is divided into several modular subsystems which renders the system easily adaptable to other scenarios."

The framework is build upon an impedance-like indirect interaction force controller that allows to use standard underactuated aerial robots as force effectors. Haptic feedback from the master side enables the user to feel the contact forces exerted by the robot. An automatic potential field-based slowing-down policy is used by the robot to ensure a smooth transition between the contact-free motion phase and the force interaction phase.

All temporal logic specifications in linear-time temporal logic (LTL) can be expressed as parity objectives. We study the qualitative analysis problem for POMDPs with parity objectives that asks whether there is a controller (policy) to ensure that the objective holds with probability 1 (almost-surely). While the qualitative analysis of POMDPs with parity objectives is undecidable, recent results show that when restricted to finite-memory policies the problem is EXPTIME-complete. While the problem is intractable in theory, we present a practical approach to solve the qualitative analysis problem. We designed several heuristics to deal with the exponential complexity, and have used our implementation on a number of well-known POMDP examples for robotics applications. Our results provide the first practical approach to solve the qualitative analysis of robot motion planning with LTL properties in the presence of uncertainty."

Each robot has its own high-level task, given as a temporal logic formula, which may include requirements regarding the other robot (e.g. the robot cannot enter a room that the other robot is currently in). This task is not initially shared with the other robot; therefore, the robots when operating, may find themselves in a conflict situation. In this paper, we develop algorithms that allow the robots to automatically, and in a provably correct manner, resolve the conflict, if possible. If the automated process fails, meaning that the robots cannot both perform their tasks in the same workspace, feedback is provided to a human, that would resolve the conflict (e.g. by changing the robot's tasks). The algorithm is demonstrated with simulated and physical robots in the lab."

The large dimensionality of manipulators and complexity of task specifications make the problem computationally intractable. This work introduces a manipulation planning framework with linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. The use of LTL as the specification language allows the expression of rich and complex manipulation tasks. The framework deals with the state-explosion problem through a novel abstraction technique. Given a robotic system, a workspace consisting of obstacles, manipulable objects, and locations of interest, and a co-safe LTL specification over the objects and locations, the framework computes a motion plan to achieve the task through a synergistic multi-layered planning architecture. The power of the framework is demonstrated through case studies, in which the planner efficiently computes plans for complex tasks. The case studies also illustrate the ability of the framework in intelligently moving away objects that block desired executions without requiring backtracking."

These sorts of conditions arise in several circumstances of increasing relevance: robots that can provide some guarantee of privacy to their users, controllers which safely use untrusted “cloud” services or smart-space infrastructure, or robots that act as inspection devices in information-sensitive contexts (e.g., factories, nuclear plants, etc.) We introduce an algorithm which takes as input an arbitrary combinatorial filter, expressed as a transition graph, and a set of constraints, constituting both upper and lower bounds, that specify the desired informational properties. The algorithm produces a coarser version of the input filter which possesses the desired informational properties, if and only if such a filter exists. We show that determining whether it is possible to satisfy both the distinguishablity and indistinguishablity constraints is NP-hard. The hardness result helps justify the worst-case running time of the algorithm. We describe an implementation of the algorithm along with empirical results showing that, beyond some minimum problem complexity, the algorithm is faster than naïve filter enumeration, albeit with greater memory requirements."

The contribution of this paper is a reactive synthesis algorithm that makes use of our adaptation procedure to update the high-level strategy each time the non-deterministic discrete abstraction is modified.

If the next position of a moving target has the Gaussian distribution, the proposed algorithm can guarantee the tracking success probability. In addition, the proposed method minimizes the moving distance of the mobile robot based on a bound on the tracking success probability.

We consider the problem of multi-robot coverage, where a group of robots has to spread out to cover the environment. We suppose that some robots have poor actuation performance (e.g. weak motors, friction losses in the gear train, wheel slip, etc.) and some have strong actuation performance (powerful motors, little friction, favorable terrain, etc.). The robots do not know before hand the relative strengths of their actuation compared to the others in the team. The algorithm in this paper learns the relative actuation performance variations among the robots on-line, in a distributed fashion, and automatically compensates by giving the weak robots a small portion of the environment, and giving the strong robots a larger portion. Using a Lyapunov-type proof, we prove that the robots converge to locally optimal positions for coverage.

Learning-based control, on the other hand, uses data to improve the model over time but is not typically guaranteed to be robust throughout the process. This paper proposes a novel combination of both ideas: a robust Min-Max Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MM-LB-NMPC) algorithm. Based on an existing LB-NMPC algorithm, we present an efficient and robust extension, altering the NMPC performance objective to optimize for the worst-case scenario. The algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous trials as a function of system state, input, and other relevant variables. Nominal state sequences are predicted using an Unscented Transform and worst-case scenarios are defined as sequences bounding the 3σ confidence region. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results from testing on a 50 kg skid-steered robot executing a path-tracking task.

To address this challenging problem of robust asymptotic stabilization of attitude dynamics, the back-stepping method along with a suitable Morse-Lyapunov (M-L) function candidate with constant control gain parameters are used to obtain a nonlinear stochastic feedback control law. The control gain matrix and the M-L function control gain can be obtained by solving a feasible LMI, which can guarantee the robust asymptotic stability of the rigid body on TSO(3).

Gosine,","The main reported solutions for the problem of multi-robot relative localization require synchronous communication between robots, where the network should communicate each time a relative measurement is logged in the team. This paper proposes a localization method, which can accommodate communication at a low predefined rate rather than forcing communication each time a measurement is logged. This is achieved without explicitly accumulating past measurements locally at each robot. This capability is necessary to support increasing number of robots in a team, under finite communication and computation resources. The design includes a novel fusion strategy, a consistent estimation method, and a state based initialization method, embedded in a distributed target tracking framework. The design is efficient in terms of computation demand, since it scales linearly with the number of robots. Additionally, the design is efficient in terms of communication demand, since communication is neither required to be synchronized with sensor readings, nor constrained to a specific network topology. The paper validates the proposed approach for its initialization capability, consistency of estimates, and robustness of performance, through several numerical simulations and using a publicly available multi-robot data set."
icra,None,Unified passivity-based Cartesian force/impedance control for rigid and flexible joint robots via task-energy tanks,"Christopher Schindlbeck,Sami Haddadin,","In this paper we propose a novel hybrid Cartesian force/impedance controller that is equipped with energy tanks to preserve passivity. Our approach overcomes the problems of (hybrid) force control, impedance control, and set-point based indirect force control. It allows accurate force tracking, full compliant impedance behavior, and safe contact resemblance simultaneously by introducing a controller shaping function that robustly handles unexpected contact loss and avoids chattering behavior that switching based approaches suffer from. Furthermore, we propose a constructive way of initiating the energy tanks via the concept of task energy. This represents an estimate of the energy consumption of a given force control task prior to execution. The controller can be applied to both rigid body and flexible joint dynamics. To show the validity of our approach, several simulations and experiments with the KUKA/DLR LWR-III are carried out."
icra,None,An invariant Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller for a simplified car,"Sébastien Diemer,Silvère Bonnabel,","In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking a reference trajectory for a simplified car model based on unicycle kinematics, whose position only is measured, and where the control input and the measurements are corrupted by independent Gaussian noises. To tackle this problem we devise a novel observer-controller: the invariant Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller (ILQG). It is based on the Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller, but the equations are slightly modified to account for, and to exploit, the symmetries of the problem. The gain tuning exhibits a reduced dependency on the estimated trajectory, and is thus less sensitive to misestimates. Beyond the fact the invariant approach is sensible (there is no reason why the controller performance should depend on whether the reference trajectory is heading west or south), we show through simulations that the ILQG outperforms the conventional LQG controller in case of large noises or large initial uncertainties."
icra,None,Intention-aware online POMDP planning for autonomous driving in a crowd,"Haoyu Bai,Shaojun Cai,Nan Ye,David Hsu,Wee Sun Lee,","This paper presents an intention-aware online planning approach for autonomous driving amid many pedestrians. To drive near pedestrians safely, efficiently, and smoothly, autonomous vehicles must estimate unknown pedestrian intentions and hedge against the uncertainty in intention estimates in order to choose actions that are effective and robust. A key feature of our approach is to use the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for systematic, robust decision making under uncertainty. Although there are concerns about the potentially high computational complexity of POMDP planning, experiments show that our POMDP-based planner runs in near real time, at 3 Hz, on a robot golf cart in a complex, dynamic environment. This indicates that POMDP planning is improving fast in computational efficiency and becoming increasingly practical as a tool for robot planning under uncertainty."
icra,None,Self-triggered collision avoidance control for multi-vehicle systems,"Erick J. Rodríguez-Seda,","The implementation of collision detection mechanisms on-board of unmanned vehicles typically relies on digital platforms and shared communication networks. The discrete nature of these technologies does not only limit the frequency at which nearby obstacles and other vehicles are detected, but it also raises the demand for a better allocation of the vehicle's computational and communication resources. For instance, it is natural and convenient to adapt the frequency at which other vehicles are observed based on their distance and collision risk, a notion that relates to topics in minimum attention control and self-triggered control. In this paper, we report on a cooperative, decentralized self-triggered avoidance control law for an arbitrary large group of unmanned vehicles that reduces the attention and sampling frequency of other vehicles' position. The proposed control strategy guarantees the safe coordination of all vehicles at all times while reducing the sampling frequency of other vehicles' position based on their last available sample. We show that the sampling intervals are positive and lower bounded, which is critical for digital implementation. A simulation example is used to illustrate the performance of the avoidance control strategy."
icra,None,Vehicle state prediction for outdoor autonomous high-speed off-road UGVs,"Graeme Neff Wilson,Alejandro Ramirez-Serrano,Qiao Sun,","This paper describes a method of vehicle state prediction for an autonomous high-speed off-road Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). Effective vehicle state prediction will allow a UGV to plan its navigation such that states (such as vertical acceleration induced by the terrain roughness) never exceed a desired threshold. In this paper a model of an n-wheeled generic vehicle is used determine its dynamics. Using a known terrain input profile the vehicle's output states are predicted using the developed n-wheel model. Simulated results of this vehicle state prediction approach are presented, as well as experimental tests using a UGV platform called Loc8. The experimental results used a 3D point cloud to determine the terrain input profile. Methods from the literature are tested against the developed n-wheeled vehicle state prediction method. Results show this n-wheel technique presents both advantages and disadvantages in comparison with existing techniques. The proposed approach predicts the average absolute acceleration much closer to the measured average absolute acceleration than existing approaches."
icra,None,Leveraged non-stationary Gaussian process regression for autonomous robot navigation,"Sungjoon Choi,Eunwoo Kim,Kyungjae Lee,Songhwai Oh,","In this paper, we propose a novel regression method that can incorporate both positive and negative training data into a single regression framework. In detail, a leveraged kernel function for non-stationary Gaussian process regression is proposed. With this new kernel function, we can vary the correlation betwen two inputs in both positive and negative directions by adjusting leverage parameters. By using this property, the resulting leveraged non-stationary Gaussian process regression can anchor the regressor to the positive data while avoiding the negative data. We first prove the positive semi-definiteness of the leveraged kernel function using Bochner's theorem. Then, we apply the leveraged non-stationary Gaussian process regression to a real-time motion control problem. In this case, the positive data refer to what to do and the negative data indicate what not to do. The results show that the controller using both positive and negative data outperforms the controller using positive data only in terms of the collision rate given training sets of the same size."
icra,None,Location utility-based map reduction,"Ted J. Steiner,Guoquan Huang,John J. Leonard,","Maps used for navigation often include a database of location descriptions for place recognition (loop closing), which permits bounded-error performance. A standard pose-graph SLAM system adds a new entry for every new pose into the location database, which grows linearly and unbounded in time and thus becomes unsustainable. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new map-reduction approach that pre-constructs a fixed-size place-recognition database amenable to the limited storage and processing resources of the vehicle by exploiting the high-level structure of the environment as well as the vehicle motion. In particular, we introduce the concept of location utility - which encapsulates the visitation probability of a location and its spatial distribution relative to nearby locations in the database - as a measure of the value of potential loop-closure events to occur at that location. While finding the optimal reduced location database is NP-hard, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm to sort all the locations in a map based on their relative utility without access to sensor measurements or the vehicle trajectory. This enables pre-determination of a generic, limited-size place-recognition database containing the N best locations in the environment. To validate the proposed approach, we develop an open-source street-map simulator using real city-map data and show that an accurate map (pose-graph) can be attained even when using a place-recognition database with only 1% of the entries of the corresponding full database."
icra,None,Autonomous robotic exploration using occupancy grid maps and graph SLAM based on Shannon and Rényi Entropy,"Henry Carrillo,Philip Dames,Vijay Kumar,José A. Castellanos,","In this paper we examine the problem of autonomously exploring and mapping an environment using a mobile robot. The robot uses a graph-based SLAM system to perform mapping and represents the map as an occupancy grid. In this setting, the robot must trade-off between exploring new area to complete the task and exploiting the existing information to maintain good localization. Selecting actions that decrease the map uncertainty while not significantly increasing the robot's localization uncertainty is challenging. We present a novel information-theoretic utility function that uses both Shannon's and Rényi's definitions of entropy to jointly consider the uncertainty of the robot and the map. This allows us to fuse both uncertainties without the use of manual tuning. We present simulations and experiments comparing the proposed utility function to state-of-the-art utility functions, which only use Shannon's entropy. We show that by using the proposed utility function, the robot and map uncertainties are smaller than using other existing methods."
icra,None,Reliable kinect-based navigation in large indoor environments,"Mihai Jalobeanu,Greg Shirakyan,Gershon Parent,Harsha Kikkeri,,,","Practical mapping and navigation solutions for large indoor environments continue to rely on relatively expensive range scanners, because of their accuracy, range and field of view. Microsoft Kinect on the other hand is inexpensive, is easy to use and has high resolution, but suffers from high noise, shorter range and a limiting field of view. We present a mapping and navigation system that uses the Microsoft Kinect sensor as the sole source of range data and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LIDAR-based systems. We show how we circumvent the main limitations of Kinect to generate usable 2D maps of relatively large spaces and to enable robust navigation in changing and dynamic environments. We use the Benchmark for Robotic Indoor Navigation (BRIN) to quantify and validate the performance of our system."
icra,None,Reducing FPGA algorithm area by avoiding redundant computation,"Brian Axelrod,Michel Laverne,","We develop a new paradigm for designing fully streaming, area-efficient FPGA implementations of common building blocks for vision algorithm. By focusing on avoiding redundant computation we achieve a reduction of one to two orders of magnitude reduction in design area utilization as compared to previous implementations. We demonstrate that our design works in practice by building five 325 frames per second, high resolution Harris corner detection cores onto a single FPGA."
icra,None,Communication-constrained multi-AUV cooperative SLAM,"Liam Paull,Guoquan Huang,Mae Seto,John J. Leonard,","Multi-robot deployments have the potential for completing tasks more efficiently. For example, in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), robots can better localize themselves and the map if they can share measurements of each other (direct encounters) and of commonly observed parts of the map (indirect encounters). However, performance is contingent on the quality of the communications channel. In the underwater scenario, communicating over any appreciable distance is achieved using acoustics which is low-bandwidth, slow, and unreliable, making cooperative operations very challenging. In this paper, we present a framework for cooperative SLAM (C-SLAM) for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) communicating only through acoustics. We develop a novel graph-based C-SLAM algorithm that is able to (optimally) generate communication packets whose size scales linearly with the number of observed features since the last successful transmission, constantly with the number of vehicles in the collective, and does not grow with time even the case of dropped packets, which are common. As a result, AUVs can bound their localization error without the need for pre-installed beacons or surfacing for GPS fixes during navigation, leading to significant reduction in time required to complete missions. The proposed algorithm is validated through realistic marine vehicle and acoustic communication simulations."
icra,None,Autonomous sampling of water columns using gliding robotic fish: Control algorithms and field experiments,"Feitian Zhang,Osama En-Nasr,Elena Litchman,Xiaobo Tan,","Gliding robotic fish, a hybrid of underwater gliders and robotic fish, are energy-efficient and highly maneuverable, and hold strong promise for long-duration sampling of underwater environments. In this paper a novel systematic autonomous water-column-based sampling scheme for gliding robotic fish is proposed to measure the three-dimensional spatial distributions of variables of interest in aquatic environments. The scheme exploits energy-efficient spiral-down motion to sample each water column, followed by sagittal-plane glide-up towards the direction of next water column. Once surfacing, the robot uses GPS guidance to reach the next column location through swimming. To enhance the path tracking performance, a two-degree-of-freedom controller involving H ∞ control is used in the spiral motion, and a sliding-mode controller is employed to regulate the yaw angle during glide-up. The sampling scheme has been implemented on a gliding robotic fish prototype, “Grace”, and verified first in pool experiments, and then in field experiments involving the sampling of harmful algae concentration in the Wintergreen Lake, Michigan."
icra,None,On autonomous cooperative Underwater Floating Manipulation Systems,"Ninad Manerikar,Giuseppe Casalino,Enrico Simetti,Sandro Torelli,,","In this paper we present a novel co-operative control policy purely for the transportation of large objects in underwater environments using two free floating vehicles, each one endowed with a 7 d.o.f redundant manipulator. Due to the presence of harsh conditions in underwater scenarios, it is extremely important to realize algorithms that depend on a minimal amount of explicit information exchanged by the agent, or without any exchange of information at all. To achieve this goal the control policy proposed in the paper only requires the exchange of six numbers at each time instant, while however exhibiting extremely good performances, inspite of the restraints on the information exchange."
icra,None,Autonomous underwater panel operation by GIRONA500 UVMS: A practical approach to autonomous underwater manipulation,"Patryk Cieslak,Pere Ridao,Mariusz Giergiel,","This paper proposes a controller for the GIRONA500 Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System and reports experimental results for an autonomous floating-base valve-turning manipulation application. The selected method is based on kinematic control, avoiding the need for a complex, and difficult to obtain, hydrodynamic model. The method relies on the decoupled control of the vehicle and manipulator velocities using a combination of the task priority redundancy resolution and the task concurrence approaches. The paper discusses the manipulation tasks needed, their hierarchical organisation, and a set of strategies that were needed to complement the `standard' task-priority approach to successfully solve the floating-base manipulation problem in water tank experimental conditions."
icra,None,Towards real-time under-ice acoustic navigation at mesoscale ranges,"Sarah E. Webster,Lee E. Freitag,Craig M. Lee,Jason I. Gobat,","This paper describes an acoustic navigation system that provides mesoscale coverage (hundreds of kilometers) under the ice and presents results from the first multi-month deployment in the Arctic. The hardware consists of ice-tethered acoustic navigation beacons transmitting at 900 Hz that broadcast their latitude and longitude plus several bytes of optional control data. The real-time under-ice navigation algorithm, based on a Kalman filter, uses time-of-flight measurements from these sources to simultaneously estimate vehicle position and depth-averaged local currents. The algorithm described herein was implemented on Seagliders, a type of autonomous underwater glider (AUG), but the underlying theory is applicable to other autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As part of an extensive field campaign from March to September 2014, eleven acoustic sources and four Seagliders were deployed to monitor the seasonal melt of the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Beaufort and northern Chukchi Seas. Beacon-to-beacon performance was excellent due to a sound duct at 100 m depth where the transmitters were positioned; the travel-time error at 200 km has a standard deviation of 40 m when sound-speed is known, and ranges in excess of 400 km were obtained. Results with the Seagliders, which were not regularly within the duct, showed reliable acoustic ranges up to 100 km and more sparse but repeatable range measurements to over 400 km. Navigation results are reported for the real-time algorithm run in post-processing mode, using data from a 295-hour segment with significant time spent under ice."
icra,None,Active drifters: Towards a practical multi-robot system for ocean monitoring,"Artem Molchanov,Andreas Breitenmoser,Gaurav S. Sukhatme,","We propose a method for controlling multiple active drifters in the presence of external forcing induced by the ocean. Our active drifters have one actuator: they can lower and raise their drogues in depth. By exploiting the vertically stratified nature of ocean currents, we show how classical multi-robot tasks (spreading out and aggregation) can be accomplished by the multi-drifter system. Tests with a realistic simulation based on an ocean model suggest that a practical implementation of active drifters which aggregate and disperse in the coastal ocean could be realized through our control method with relatively inexpensive components. Specifically, we are able to show that over a 90 day deployment a significant fraction of drifters can be made to aggregate in few clusters suitable for recovery."
icra,None,Backstepping control with energy reduction for an over-actuated marine platform,"Aristomenis Tsopelakos,Kostas Vlachos,Evangelos Papadopoulos,","We present the design of a backstepping controller for a triangular over-actuated marine platform, controlled by three rotating jets. Our goal is the stabilization of the position and the orientation of the platform, under realistic environmental disturbances, such as wind forces, wave forces and hydrodynamic forces. Actuator thrust and angle dynamics, as well as settling delays, in the rotation of the jets and in the response of the desired thrust, are included in the algorithm, despite the presence of an allocation scheme. Thrust and angle velocity, limitations are also taken into account. A Thrust Upper Limit (TUL) manipulation heuristic is introduced in order to reduce the thrust requirements and the energy consumed. The performance of the developed backstepping controller is compared to the case with and without the TUL. Simulation results show that the use of the heuristic reduces energy consumption."
icra,None,Coactive learning with a human expert for robotic information gathering,"Thane Somers,Geoffrey A. Hollinger,","We present a coactive algorithm for learning a human expert's preferences in planning trajectories for information gathering in scientific autonomy domains. The algorithm learns these preferences by iteratively presenting solutions to the expert and updating an estimated utility function based on the expert's improvements. We apply these algorithms, in the context of underwater data collection, using a pair of risk and reward maps. In simulated trials, the algorithm successfully learns the underlying weighting behind a utility map used by a human planning trajectories. We also present experimental trials demonstrating the algorithm using a temperature and depth monitoring task in an inland lake with an autonomous surface vehicle. This work shows it is possible to design algorithms for autonomous navigation with reward functions that capture the essence of a human's preferences."
icra,None,Autonomous Underwater Vehicle localization in a spatiotemporally varying water current field,"Lashika Medagoda,James C. Kinsey,Martin Eilders,","Survey class Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) typically rely on Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) for precise navigation near the seafloor. In cases where the distance to the seafloor is greater than the DVL bottom lock range, localizing between the surface where GPS is available and the seafloor presents a localization problem, since both GPS and DVL are unavailable in the mid-water column. Previous work proposed a solution to navigation in the mid-water column that exploits the stability of the vertical water current profile in space over the minutes scale. With repeated measurements of these currents with the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) mode of the DVL during vertical descent, along with sensor fusion of other low cost sensors, position error growth is constrained to near the initial velocity uncertainty of the vehicle at the sea surface during the dive. Following DVL bottom lock, due to correlations in the joint vehicle and water current velocity estimation, the entire velocity history is further constrained. In this paper a number of extensions are developed to improve navigation performance during missions characterized by prolonged time-scales and horizontal transits. This includes explicitly accounting for the temporal evolution of water currents while revisiting locations and during the re-observation itself, in addition to employing high fidelity spatial models to account for the horizontal water current field. Furthermore, the validity of our method is demonstrated on deep water data sets. Results from the Sentry AUV are presented from a hydrothermal vent flux estimation mission and a surveying mission at Deepwater Horizon, illustrating a real-time dead-reckoning method with results for up to 20 hours."

For this purpose, the optimal design of a Langevin transducer with stepped horn profile is presented for internal-body applications. The modeling, optimization and design of the ultrasonic scalpel are performed through equivalent circuit theory and verified by finite element analysis. Moreover, a novel two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) surgical end effector (1-DOF pitch, 1-DOF grip) with decoupled motions is developed that is compatible with the da Vinci® surgical system. The developed instrument is then driven using the dVRK (da Vinci® research kit) and the Classic da Vinci® surgical system."
icra,None,Force control for tissue tensioning in precise robotic laser surgery,"S. Portolés,P. Vanbiervliet,B. Rosa,C. Tomassetti,C. Meuleman,,,","Lasers are being used in various surgical procedures to remove tissue or bones, to coagulate vessels or other structures. Due to difficulties in handling only a limited number of surgeons manage to display sufficient levels of precision in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures. Prior works on robotic laser surgery demonstrated shorter learning curves and higher ablation precision, but unfortunately ignored the fact that most clinically relevant tasks are bi-manual by nature. Surgeons are also reluctant to use current commercial surgical robotic systems for complex laser tasks, indicating that the lack of haptic feedback prevents them from efficient and safe tissue handling in preparation of laser treatment. This paper expands earlier robotic laser work towards bi-manual operation. The paper introduces a system for precisely tensioning tissue that is being targeted by the laser. An artificial test-setup that captures some essential features of bimanual laser surgery is described. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of haptic feedback on ablation performance. A comparison is made of achievable levels of ablation precision when there is no haptic feedback, when there is haptic feedback and when an automatic tension control algorithm is deployed. The conducted experimental results confirm the great potential of haptic feedback and automatic tensioning systems for complex bi-manual lasering tasks."

We confirmed that the existence and the movement of LoMS do not decrease the fMRI image quality when the distance between LoMS and the head coil of MRI is practical distance (more than 400 mm). We also confirmed that LoMS can operate properly in MRI environment, which is to measure own joint angle avoiding the noise from fMRI imaging. Then we show that the brain activity related to gait motion can be imaged during gait-like motion."
icra,None,Photoacoustic image guidance for robot-assisted skull base surgery,"Sungmin Kim,Hyun Jae Kang,Alexis Cheng,Muyinatu A. Lediju Bell,,,","We are investigating the use of photoacoustic (PA) imaging to detect critical structures, such as the carotid artery, that may be located behind the bone being drilled during robot-assisted endonasal transsphenoidal surgery. In this system, the laser is mounted on the drill (via an optical fiber) and the 2D ultrasound (US) probe is placed elsewhere on the skull. Both the drill and the US probe are tracked relative to the patient reference frame. PA imaging provides two advantages compared to conventional B-mode US: (1) the laser penetrates thin layers of bone, and (2) the PA image displays targets that are in the laser path. Thus, the laser can be used to (non-invasively) extend the drill axis, thereby enabling reliable detection of critical structures that may reside in the drill path. This setup creates a challenging alignment problem, however, because the US probe must be placed so that its image plane intersects the laser line in the neighborhood of the target anatomy (as estimated from preoperative images). This paper reports on a navigation system developed to assist with this task, and the results of phantom experiments that demonstrate that a critical structure can be detected with an accuracy of approximately 1 mm relative to the drill tip."
icra,None,Surgical tool pose estimation from monocular endoscopic videos,"Suren Kumar,Javad Sovizi,Madusudanan Sathia Narayanan,Venkat Krovi,","Surgical tool pose estimation has been proven to be useful for high- and low- level feedback tasks including safety-enhancement, semantic feedback and surgical skill assessment. Tool pose estimation using monocular camera input is a well-studied research problem as the monocular camera is one of the ubiquitous sensor across the spectrum of robotic devices. Current state-of-the art methods for visual tool pose estimation are computationally expensive and require elaborate geometric and appearance models of surgical tools. We propose a visual tool pose estimation method that maps the visual bounding box to the 3D tool pose without any explicit knowledge of tool geometry using Gaussian process regression. The proposed approach can be generalized to any surgical tool and provides tool pose estimates with a variance estimate in real-time. We demonstrate rigorous evaluation of the method under various conditions that might effect the estimation process. In order to evaluate the algorithm, we have instrumented a standard box trainer kit with two laparoscopic tools to get simultaneous ground truth pose and a video feed."

In this paper, a wearable robotic forceps manipulator is proposed. By measuring the wrist attitude of the surgeon by a motion sensor and driving the forceps tip by actuators, intuitive operation is realized, compared with fully mechanical forceps. A compact and lightweight system is achieved since we adopt pneumatic actuators to drive the manipulator. In order to help the force sensing of the surgeon, the external force is measured from the air pressure and displayed in a visual way. Experimental comparison with a conventional handheld forceps and a teleoperation system is conducted and its results show the effectiveness of the proposed handheld forceps."
icra,None,Tackling friction - an analytical modeling approach to understanding friction in single tendon driven continuum manipulators,"Guru Subramani,Michael R. Zinn,","Tendon driven continuum robots have attracted a significant amount of attention in the last decade. As a result several discrete and continuous modeling approaches have been explored in order to understand their behavior. The following article proposes an analytical model describing the influence of frictional effects between the tendon and its conduit in tendon driven continuum robotic manipulators. Existing constant curvature models ignore internal device friction completely and treat it as a negligible effect. This results in an assumption that the tendon tension is always constant along the length of the continuum manipulator. While this assumption is reasonable for small articulation angles, internal device friction can significantly change internal tension distribution deteriorating performance of constant curvature models at high articulation angles. The proposed model departs from the constant tension assumption and predicts a tension distribution along the tendon. From the tension distribution a curvature distribution is determined. It is observed that the proposed nonlinear friction model performs better than the existing linear elastic constant curvature model. Following this, a consequence of internal device friction: hysteresis effects are predicted. An algorithm that estimates tendon tension distribution given applied tendon tension history is proposed."

Nelson,","This paper presents a method to localize a magnetically guided catheter using a single rotating C-Arm. Because the three dimensional position of the catheter tip, when extracted from a single view, contains large uncertainties, we propose to combine multiple views by rotating the C-Arm and using a Kalman filter. The proposed approach yields good tracking performance for several catheter poses and reduces the maximum estimated standard deviation to 0.3 cm after incorporating six views. This represents a 62 percent reduction in three dimensional position uncertainty."
icra,None,"Practical, stretchable smart skin sensors for contact-aware robots in safe and collaborative interactions","John O'Neill,Jason Lu,Rodney Dockter,Timothy Kowalewski,","Safe, intuitive human-robot interaction requires that robots intelligently interface with their environments, ideally sensing and localizing physical contact across their link surfaces. We introduce a stretchable smart skin sensor that provides this function. Stretchability allows it to conform to arbitrary robotic link surfaces. It senses contact over nearly the entire surface, localizes contact position of a typical finger touch continuously over its entire surface (RMSE = 7.02mm for a 14.7cm×14.7cm area), and provides an estimate of the contact force. Our approach exclusively employs stretchable, flexible materials resulting in skin strains of up to 150%. We exploit novel carbon nanotube elastomers to create a two-dimensional potentiometer surface. Finite element simulations validate a simplified polynomial surface model to enable real-time processing on a basic microcontroller with no supporting electronics. Using only five electrodes, the skin can be scaled up to arbitrary sizes without needing additional electrodes. We designed, implemented, calibrated, and tested a prototype smart skin as a tactile sensor on a custom medical robot for sensing unexpected physical interactions. We experimentally demonstrate its utility in collaborative robotic applications by showing its potential to enable safer, more intuitive human-robot interaction."
icra,None,An optimisation-based path planner for truck-trailer systems with driving direction changes,"Patrik Zips,Martin Böck,Andreas Kugi,","This paper presents a path planning concept for trucks with trailers with kingpin hitching. This system is nonholonomic, has no flat output and is not stable in backwards driving direction. These properties are major challenges for path planning. The presented approach concentrates on the loading bay scenario. The considered task is to plan a path for the truck-trailer system from a start to a specified target configuration corresponding to the loading bay. Thereby, close distances to obstacles and multiple driving direction changes have to be handled. Furthermore, a so-called jackknife position has to be avoided. In a first step, an initial path is planned from the target to the start configuration using a tree-based path planner. Afterwards this path is refined locally by solving an optimal control problem. Due to the local nature of the planner, heuristic rules for direction changes are formulated. The performance of the proposed path planner is evaluated in simulation studies."
icra,None,Distance metric learning for RRT-based motion planning with constant-time inference,"Luigi Palmieri,Kai O. Arras,","The distance metric is a key component in RRT-based motion planning that deeply affects coverage of the state space, path quality and planning time. With the goal to speed up planning time, we introduce a learning approach to approximate the distance metric for RRT-based planners. By exploiting a novel steer function which solves the two-point boundary value problem for wheeled mobile robots, we train a simple nonlinear parametric model with constant-time inference that is shown to predict distances accurately in terms of regression and ranking performance. In an extensive analysis we compare our approach to an Euclidean distance baseline, consider four alternative regression models and study the impact of domain-specific feature expansion. The learning approach is shown to be faster in planning time by several factors at negligible loss of path quality."
icra,None,The Dynamics Projection Filter (DPF) - real-time nonlinear trajectory optimization using projection operators,"Sanjiban Choudhury,Sebastian Scherer,","Robotic navigation applications often require on-line generation of trajectories that respect underactuated non-linear dynamics, while optimizing a cost function that depends only on a low-dimensional workspace (collision avoidance). Approaches to non-linear optimization, such as differential dynamic programming (DDP), suffer from the drawbacks of slow convergence by being limited to stay within the trust-region of the linearized dynamics and having to integrate the dynamics with fine granularity at each iteration. We address the problem of decoupling the workspace optimization from the enforcement of non-linear constraints. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics Projection Filter, a nonlinear projection operator based approach that first optimizes a workspace trajectory with reduced constraints and then projects (filters) it to a feasible configuration space trajectory that has a bounded sub-optimality guarantee. We show simulation results for various curvature and curvature-derivatives constrained systems, where the dynamics projection filter is able to, on average, produce similar quality solution 50 times faster than DDP. We also show results from flight tests on an autonomous helicopter that solved these problems on-line while avoiding mountains at high speed as well as trees and buildings as it came in to land."
icra,None,Motion planning of drifting vehicle with friction model considering nonholonomic constraint,"Akihiro Morinaga,Mikhail Svinin,Motoji Yamamoto,","Conventional motion planners for wheeled vehicles often assume no-slipping and no-skidding conditions and construct motion trajectories in the context of nonholonomic motion planning. However, in some practical situations slipping and skidding cannot be ignored or can even be useful. To take them into account in the construction of planning algorithms, it is important to model the friction force between the tire and the contact plane. In this paper, we first construct a model of the friction force as an extension of the two-dimensional Coulomb model, considering both the slipping conditions and the nonholonomic constraints. Next, we formulate the motion planning problem as a drift parking problem and propose a motion planning strategy combining the nonholonomic planner and the control in the slipping mode. The feasibility and the performance of the proposed strategy are tested under simulation."
icra,None,Dynamic model and motion planning for a pendulum-actuated spherical rolling robot,"Mikhail Svinin,Yang Bai,Motoji Yamamoto,","This paper deals with the dynamics and motion planning for a spherical rolling robot with a pendulum actuated by two motors. First a dynamic model for the rolling robot is established. In general, not all feasible kinematic trajectories of the rolling carrier are dynamically realizable. A notable exception is when the contact trajectories on the sphere and on the plane are geodesic lines. Based on this consideration, a motion planning strategy for complete reconfiguration of the rolling robot is proposed. The strategy consists of two trivial movements and a non-trivial maneuver that is based on tracing multiple spherical triangles. To compute the sizes and the number of triangles, a reachability diagram is constructed. To define the control torques realizing the rest-to-rest motion along the geodesic lines, two possible approaches are suggested. A computational algorithm, implementing the motion planning strategy, is developed and verified under simulation."
icra,None,"Fast, continuous state path smoothing to improve navigation accuracy","Henrik Andreasson,Jari Saarinen,Marcello Cirillo,Todor Stoyanov,,","Autonomous navigation in real-world industrial environments is a challenging task in many respects. One of the key open challenges is fast planning and execution of trajectories to reach arbitrary target positions and orientations with high accuracy and precision, while taking into account non-holonomic vehicle constraints. In recent years, lattice-based motion planners have been successfully used to generate kinematically and kinodynamically feasible motions for non-holonomic vehicles. However, the discretized nature of these algorithms induces discontinuities in both state and control space of the obtained trajectories, resulting in a mismatch between the achieved and the target end pose of the vehicle. As endpose accuracy is critical for the successful loading and unloading of cargo in typical industrial applications, automatically planned paths have not be widely adopted in commercial AGV systems. The main contribution of this paper addresses this shortcoming by introducing a path smoothing approach, which builds on the output of a lattice-based motion planner to generate smooth drivable trajectories for non-holonomic industrial vehicles. In real world tests presented in this paper we demonstrate that the proposed approach is fast enough for online use (it computes trajectories faster than they can be driven) and highly accurate. In 100 repetitions we achieve mean end-point pose errors below 0.01 meters in translation and 0.002 radians in orientation. Even the maximum errors are very small: only 0.02 meters in translation and 0.008 radians in orientation."
icra,None,Snakeboard motion planning with viscous friction and skidding,"Tony Dear,Scott David Kelly,Matthew Travers,Howie Choset,","The snakeboard is a well-studied example for mechanical systems analysis, largely because of its simultaneous richness in behavior and simplicity in design. However, few snakeboard models incorporate dissipative friction in the traveling direction and skidding as a violation of the rigid nonholonomic constraints. In this paper we investigate these effects on trajectory planning by evaluating a previously proposed friction model as well as a novel skidding model based on the addition of Rayleigh dissipation functions. We show how these additions change the usual behavior of gaits in the forward planning problem, and incorporate the changes into the solutions of the inverse planning problem by utilizing body coordinates along with a curvature parameterization for trajectories."
icra,None,A time-optimal bounded velocity path-following controller for generic Wheeled Mobile Robots,"Reza Oftadeh,Reza Ghabcheloo,Jouni Mattila,","This paper, as a generalization of our previous works, presents a unified time-optimal path-following controller for Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs). Unlike other path-following controllers, we solve the path-following problem for all common categories of WMRs such as car-like, differential, omnidirectional, all wheels steerable and others. We show that the insertion of our path-following controller into the kinematic and non-holonomic constraints of the wheels, simplifies the otherwise impenetrable constraints, resulting in explicit monotonic functions between the velocity of the base and that of the wheels. Based on this foundation, we present a closed-form solution that keeps all the wheels' steering and driving velocities within their corresponding pre-specified bounds. Simulation data and experimental results from executing the controller in a real-time environment demonstrate the efficacy of the method."
icra,None,Image-based control relying on conic curves foliation for passing through a gate,"Paolo Salaris,Christian Vassallo,Philippe Souères,Jean-Paul Laumond,","This paper presents a geometric approach to the problem of designing visual feedback control laws to steer a nonholonomic vehicle, equipped with a fixed monocular camera, through a gate. The originality of our approach is to introduce and exploit the natural geometry induced by the presence of a gate in the environment, e.g. bundle of hyperbolae, ellipses and circles, providing stabilizing feedback control laws that steer the vehicle through the middle of the gate. Moreover, using visual servoing we prove that this geometry can be measured directly in the camera image plane. As a consequence, we provide an image-based control scheme, avoiding the use of a state observer. Simulations in a realistic scenario and experiments are provided to show the effectiveness of our feedback control laws."
icra,None,Unsupervised robot learning to predict person motion,"Shuang Xiao,Zhan Wang,John Folkesson,",Socially interacting robots will need to understand the intentions and recognize the behaviors of people they come in contact with. In this paper we look at how a robot can learn to recognize and predict people's intended path based on its own observations of people over time. Our approach uses people tracking on the robot from either RGBD cameras or LIDAR. The tracks are separated into homogeneous motion classes using a pre-trained SVM. Then the individual classes are clustered and prototypes are extracted from each cluster. These are then used to predict a person's future motion based on matching to a partial prototype and using the rest of the prototype as the predicted motion. Results from experiments in a kitchen environment in our lab demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method.
icra,None,Multi-band Hough Forests for detecting humans with Reflective Safety Clothing from mobile machinery,"Rafael Mosberger,Bastian Leibe,Henrik Andreasson,Achim J. Lilienthal,","We address the problem of human detection from heavy mobile machinery and robotic equipment operating at industrial working sites. Exploiting the fact that workers are typically obliged to wear high-visibility clothing with reflective markers, we propose a new recognition algorithm that specifically incorporates the highly discriminative features of the safety garments in the detection process. Termed Multi-band Hough Forest, our detector fuses the input from active near-infrared (NIR) and RGB color vision to learn a human appearance model that not only allows us to detect and localize industrial workers, but also to estimate their body orientation. We further propose an efficient pipeline for automated generation of training data with high-quality body part annotations that are used in training to increase detector performance. We report a thorough experimental evaluation on challenging image sequences from a real-world production environment, where persons appear in a variety of upright and non-upright body positions."
icra,None,Pedestrian detection with a Large-Field-Of-View deep network,"Anelia Angelova,Alex Krizhevsky,Vincent Vanhoucke,","Pedestrian detection is of crucial importance to autonomous driving applications. Methods based on deep learning have shown significant improvements in accuracy, which makes them particularly suitable for applications, such as pedestrian detection, where reducing the miss rate is very important. Although they are accurate, their runtime has been at best in seconds per image, which makes them not practical for onboard applications. We present a Large-Field-Of-View (LFOV) deep network for pedestrian detection, that can achieve high accuracy and is designed to make deep networks work faster for detection problems. The idea of the proposed Large-Field-of-View deep network is to learn to make classification decisions simultaneously and accurately at multiple locations. The LFOV network processes larger image areas at much faster speeds than typical deep networks have been able to, and can intrinsically reuse computations. Our pedestrian detection solution, which is a combination of a LFOV network and a standard deep network, works at 280 ms per image on GPU and achieves 35.85 average miss rate on the Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark."
icra,None,SNAPCAT-3D: Calibrating networks of 3D range sensors for pedestrian tracking,"Dylan F. Glas,Dražen Brščič,Takahiro Miyashita,Norihiro Hagita,","The use of 3D range sensors for human position tracking has grown in recent years, especially for augmenting robotic sensing for human-robot interaction. However, extrinsic calibration of the relative positions of 3D range sensors is difficult, due to their limited range, narrow field of view, and distortion at large distances. 2D laser range finders have also been used for pedestrian tracking, providing greater accuracy and coverage at the cost of being more expensive and susceptible to occlusion. In this work, we present two novel techniques for calibrating the positions of 3D range sensors based on shared observations of pedestrians. The first technique uses 3D range sensors alone, and the second technique uses 2D and 3D range sensors together, using the high precision and long range of the 2D sensors to complement the short-range but richer sensing of 3D range sensors. We evaluate the accuracy of both automatic calibration techniques, and we furthermore show that the combination of 2D and 3D sensors gives more robust and accurate calibration than when using 3D sensors alone."
icra,None,Goal-oriented visual tracking of pedestrians with motion priors in semi-crowded scenes,"Francisco Madrigal,Jean-Bernard Hayet,","We propose a methodology for learning and using a multiple-goal probabilistic motion model within a particle filter-based target tracking on video streams. In a set of training video sequences, we first extract the locations (coined as “goals”) where the pedestrians either leave the scene or often change directions. Then, we learn one motion prior model per detected goal. Each of these models is learned statistically based on the local motion observed by the camera during the training phase. Given that the initial, empirical distribution may be incomplete or noisy, we regularize it in a second phase. These priors are then used in an Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) scheme for target tracking and goal estimation. We demonstrate the relevance of this methodology with tracking experiments and comparisons done on standard datasets."
icra,None,Person tracking and following with 2D laser scanners,"Angus Leigh,Joelle Pineau,Nicolas Olmedo,Hong Zhang,","Having accurate knowledge of the positions of people around a robot provides rich, objective and quantitative data that can be highly useful for a wide range of tasks, including autonomous person following. The primary objective of this research is to promote the development of robust, repeatable and transferable software for robots that can automatically detect, track and follow people in their environment. The work is strongly motivated by the need for such functionality onboard an intelligent power wheelchair robot designed to assist people with mobility impairments. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for robust detection, tracking and following from laser data. We show that the approach is effective in various environments, both indoor and outdoor, and on different robot platforms (the intelligent power wheelchair and a Clearpath Husky). The method has been implemented in the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework and will be publicly released as a ROS package. We also describe and will release several datasets designed to promote the standardized evaluation of similar algorithms."
icra,None,Automatic initialization for skeleton tracking in optical motion capture,"Tobias Schubert,Alexis Gkogkidis,Tonio Ball,Wolfram Burgard,","The ability to track skeletal movements is important in a variety of applications including animation, biological studies and animal experiments. To detect even small movements, such a method should provide highly accurate estimates. Besides that it should not impede the mammal in its motion. This motivates the usage of a passive optical motion capture system. Thereby the main challenges are the initialization, the association of the unlabeled markers to their corresponding segment also across the frames, and the estimation of the skeleton configuration. While many existing approaches can deal with the latter two problems, they typically need a specific pose for initialization. This is rather unpractical in the context of animal tracking and often requires a manual initialization process. In this paper, we present an approach to reliably track animals and humans in marker-based optical motion capture systems with freely attached markers. Our method is also able to perform an automatic initialization without any pre-or post-processing of the data. To achieve this, our approach utilizes a large database of previously observed poses. We present our algorithm and its evaluation on real-world data sets with an animal and humans. The results demonstrate that our initialization method performs accurately for the most kind of initial poses and our tracking approach outperforms a popular fully automatic skeleton tracking method especially with respect to the smoothness of the motion."
icra,None,REACH - Realtime crowd tracking using a hybrid motion model,"Aniket Bera,Dinesh Manocha,","We present a novel, real-time algorithm to extract the trajectory of each pedestrian in moderately dense crowd videos. In order to improve the tracking accuracy, we use a hybrid motion model that combines discrete and continuous flow models. The discrete model is based on microscopic agent formulation and is used for local navigation, interaction, and collision avoidance. The continuum model accounts for macroscopic behaviors, including crowd orientation and flow. We use our hybrid model with particle filters to compute the trajectories at interactive rates. We demonstrate its performance in moderately-dense crowd videos with tens of pedestrians and highlight the improved accuracy on different datasets."
icra,None,Augmenting physical state prediction through structured activity inference,"Nam N. Vo,Aaron F. Bobick,","We address the problem of predicting the physical state of a an agent performing a known activity. In particular we are interested in predicting human movement during complex composite activities. Our proposed framework combines a graphical model that extends the Sequential Interval Network (SIN) [1] for modeling global temporal structure of activities with a low level dynamic system for modeling the dynamics of the physical state. Specifically, two sets of new hidden state variables are added: one with respect to the temporal structure and one with respect to time. A mapping factor is defined to ensure these variables values remain consistent and hence allows fusing the two sources of information. We then derive an inference algorithm for computing the posterior densities of the hidden variables. The system can run in an on-line predictive mode to recognize on-going activity and make predictions arbitrarily far in the future during execution of the activity. Experiments illustrate that the long term prediction performance benefits from the knowledge about the temporal structure of the activity while short term prediction performance is improved by incorporating the dynamics of physical state."
icra,None,End-tip speed maximization for noncyclic swing motion based on time reversal integral in multiple-joint robots,"Takatoshi Hondo,Ikuo Mizuuchi,","This paper describes a control method for noncyclic swing motions such as throwing, hitting and kicking in multiple-joint robots by using “time reversal integral.” This method calculates a control input sequence and an initial posture of the robot to reach a designated terminal state by integrating a dynamic system without directly designating trajectories. The terminal end-tip speed is maximized by optimizing the target terminal state under constraints such as friction and the joint position limits. Feasibility of the method is evaluated by ball throwing experiments."
icra,None,Model-based feedforward position control of constant curvature continuum robots using feedback linearization,"Valentin Falkenhahn,Alexander Hildebrandt,Rüdiger Neumann,Oliver Sawodny,","Fast and exact motions of continuum robots are hardly seen so far. Partly this is caused by physical constraints, e.g. small available actuation forces. Another reason is the dynamic coupling between the actuators that cannot be neglected during fast motions. Therefore, a model-based MIMO controller in actuator space was developed, that is based on a spatial dynamic model with one mass point per section. Using feedback linearization, the actuators can be decoupled and feedforward control in combination with linear controllers can be applied. Measurements of an example manipulator show the good tracking result of pure feedforward action with feedback linearization. Adding a linear PD-controller increases the robustness against disturbances without reducing the possibility of fast motions."
icra,None,Generalized projector for task priority transitions during hierarchical control,"Mingxing Liu,Sovannara Hak,Vincent Padois,","Redundant robots performing multiple tasks of different priority levels are often handled by hierarchical control frameworks. This paper proposes a general hierarchical control approach that can handle not only a single standard lexicographic hierarchy, but also a complex priority network involving both strict and non-strict task priorities. In this approach, priorities can be defined by pairs of tasks and are encoded by a priority matrix. Priority modulations are achieved by the regulation of a novel generalized projector, which takes the priority matrix as input. This projector allows a task to be completely projected in the null-space of a set of tasks, while partially projected in those of some other tasks. Such a projector can be used to achieve multiple priority rearrangements simultaneously. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a KUKA LWR robot performing task priority rearrangements as well as task insertion and deletion."
icra,None,A model predictive control approach for the Partner Ballroom Dance Robot,"Gabriele Buondonno,Federico Patota,Hongbo Wang,Alessandro De Luca,,","A model predictive controller is developed for following the position of a human dancer in robot ballroom dancing. The control design uses a dynamic model of a dancer, based on a variant of the so-called 3D Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode that includes also the swing foot. This model serves as a basis for a Kalman predictor of the human motion during the single-support phase, while a simpler kinematic technique is used during the double-support phase. The output of the prediction filter enables to design a Model Predictive Control (MPC) law, by recursively solving on line and within a preview window a convex linear-quadratic optimization problem, constrained by differential kinematic bounds on robot commands. Two different control strategies, either at the velocity or at the acceleration level, are proposed and compared in simulations and in actual experiments. Accurate and reactive behaviors are obtained by the ballroom robot follower, confirming the benefit of the predictive/filtering nature of a MPC approach to handle uncertainty of human intentions and noisy signals."
icra,None,Passivity of virtual free-floating dynamics rendered on robotic facilities,"Marco De Stefano,Jordi Artigas,Wolfgang Rackl,Alin Albu-Schaeffer,","This paper describes a control strategy to achieve high fidelity dynamics simulation rendered on admittance controlled robotic facilities. It explores the reasons for an increasing energy found in the virtual dynamics of a free-floating satellite rendered on a six degree of freedom robot, which can lead the system to become unstable and proposes a method to cope with it. The proposed method identifies the sources of intrinsic instability provoked by time delays that are found in the computational loop of the rendered dynamics and counteracts their destabilizing effects using the passivity criteria. The performance of the system and the benefits of the method are shown in simulations and are verified experimentally."
icra,None,A comparison of braking strategies for elastic joint robots,"Nico Mansfeld,Sami Haddadin,","It has recently been shown that intrinsically elastic robots are capable of outperforming rigid robots in terms of peak velocity by making systematic use of energy storage and release. Certainly, high link side velocities are beneficial for performance, however, they also increase the probability of self damage or human injury in case of a collision. To ensure the physical integrity of both human and robot, it is therefore crucial to avoid potentially dangerous collisions and react in a compliant manner if unwanted contact has occurred or may occur unforeseeable. In this paper, we consider the most intuitive collision anticipation and pre-reaction scheme, namely stopping an elastic robot, if possible in minimum time. For 1-DOF elastic joints with limited elastic deflection we extend existing model-based and model-free controllers and compare their performance. Furthermore, we analyze the braking trajectory that is achieved with the different strategies. The 1-DOF solution is extended to the double pendulum case, where we show that feasible estimates for maximum and final position can be obtained at the very first instant of braking."
icra,None,Robotic manipulation of micro/nanoparticles using optical tweezers with velocity constraints and stochastic perturbations,"Xiao Yan,Chien Chern Cheah,Quang-Cuong Pham,Jean-Jacques E. Slotine,","Various control approaches have been developed for micro/nanomanipulations using optical tweezers. Most existing methods assume that the micro/nanoparticles stay trapped during manipulations, and stochastic perturbations (Brownian motion) are usually ignored for the simplification of model dynamics. However, the trapped particles could escape from the optical traps especially in motion due to several possible reasons: small trapping stiffness, stochastic perturbations, and kinetic energy gained during manipulation. This paper investigates the conditions under which micro/nanoparticles will stay trapped while in motion. The dynamics of the trapped particles subject to stochastic perturbations is analyzed. Dynamic trapping is considered and the maximum manipulation velocity is determined from a probabilistic perspective. A controller with certain velocity bound is proposed, the stability of the system is analysed in presence of stochastic perturbation. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach."
icra,None,Robotic manipulation of a biological cell using multiple optical traps,"Chien Chern Cheah,Quang Minh Ta,Reza Haghighi,","Existing control techniques for optical tweezers utilize a single focused laser beam to directly trap and manipulate a target cell. However, a typical force generated by an optical trap is extremely small (few pico-newtons) and therefore it is not sufficient to manipulate a larger cell or object. The optical trap is also sensitive to the shape of the biological cell and the refractive index. Therefore, current automatic control techniques for optical tweezers cannot be used to manipulate a large cell or cell with irregular shape. In addition, excessive irradiation of the laser beam to the cell may also cause photodamage of even lead to death of the cell. In this paper, we propose a robotic control technique for optical tweezers to achieve automated manipulation of cell, which is beyond the capability of a single optical trap. First, multiple laser beams are generated, and each laser beam is used to trap one micro-particle to create a formation around the target cell to hold it. Then the target cell is manipulated to a desired position by controlling the motorized stage. The proposed control technique is particularly suitable for automated manipulation of sensitive biological cells, cells with large size or cells of irregular shape. Rigorous mathematical formulations have been developed to analyze the control system for automated cell manipulation. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller."
icra,None,Novel pairwise coupled kinematic solution for algebraic angular acceleration estimation of serial link manipulators,"Juho Vihonen,Janne Honkakorpi,Jouni Mattila,Ari Visa,","We consider low-noise angular acceleration estimation for multi-axis robotic manipulators. The proposed model uses pairwise coupled inertial measurements across a section of the kinematic chain, which is reduced to a single rigid body. Experimental validation is built upon compact low-power micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) components, installed on a full-scale heavy-duty mobile manipulator. While the model itself has a built-in mechanism for common-mode disturbance rejection, an adaptive transversal filter is devised for a further improvement. The results indicate a 40-80 fold suppression of high-frequency perturbations with respect to a baseline motion derivative, the discrete difference. As inertial sensors require no mechanical contact to rotating axes and the number of parameters is kept low, the model is easily applicable to motion control feedback of typical heavy-duty manipulators."
icra,None,A mobile self-leveling landing platform for VTOL UAVs,"Stephen A. Conyers,Nikolaos I. Vitzilaios,Matthew J. Rutherford,Kimon P. Valavanis,","A semi-autonomous mobile self-leveling landing platform designed to launch, recover and re-launch VTOL UAVs without the need for human intervention is described. The landing platform is rugged, lightweight and inexpensive, making it ideal for civilian applications that require a base station from which a rotorcraft UAV can be launched and/or recovered on terrain that is normally unsuitable for UAV take-off and landing. This landing platform is capable of autonomously self-leveling on rough terrain and inclines up to 25°, and can operate in isolated remote locations for extended periods of time using large onboard lithium batteries and wireless communication. The unique design aspects of this landing platform are that it is mobile, self-leveling, and man-portable. A fully-operational prototype has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Design details and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the landing platform's functionality, and that all primary design requirements have been met."
icra,None,Parallel elastic actuation for efficient large payload locomotion,"Fabian Günther,Yafeng Shu,Fumiya Iida,","For legged devices, their ability of carrying payload is a necessity for a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we present a new approach of carrying payload by using a parallel elastic mechanism, which is able to carry payloads of at least 3 times of its bodyweight. Although the robot has no sensory feedback and consists of only two rigid bodies and one spring loaded joint, it is able to achieve efficient and stable forward hopping for a wide range of attached payload. The presented payload carrier ETH Cargo is based on the further development of our platform CHIARO for the payload range between 0 and 100kg. After parameter optimization using simulations, a series of real world experiments prove stable and high efficiency hopping of the prototype over a wide range of payloads."

This novel robot mainly executes two tasks: the carrying armamentarium of round medical supplies and the recording electronic health data on rounds. An omni-directional mobile mechanism and a human tracking control system to follow a specified medical professionals realize smooth transfer movement from the nurses' station to patient's bedroom. Electronic health data on rounds is automatically recorded by using a CCD camera and a voice recorder. When the robot is connected via a cable to a medical data server in nurses' station, the robot transmits the patients' data to the server and receives new patients' information."
icra,None,Using parallel stiffness to achieve improved locomotive efficiency with the Sandia STEPPR robot,"Anirban Mazumdar,Steven Spencer,Jonathan Salton,Clinton Hobart,,,,,,,,,,,","In this paper we introduce STEPPR (Sandia Transmission-Efficient Prototype Promoting Research), a bipedal robot designed to explore efficient bipedal walking. The initial iteration of this robot achieves efficient motions through powerful electromagnetic actuators and highly back-drivable synthetic rope transmissions. We show how the addition of parallel elastic elements at select joints is predicted to provide substantial energetic benefits: reducing cost of transport by 30 to 50 percent. Two joints in particular, hip roll and ankle pitch, reduce dissipated power over three very different gait types: human walking, human-like robot walking, and crouched robot walking. Joint springs based on this analysis are tested and validated experimentally. Finally, this paper concludes with the design of two unique parallel spring mechanisms to be added to the current STEPPR robot in order to provide improved locomotive efficiency."
icra,None,Harmonic analysis of a PZT poly-actuator,"James Torres,H. Harry Asada,","Similar to combustion engines comprising multiple cylinders engaged with a crankshaft, multiple piezoelectric stack actuators (PSA) engaged with a common output rod can produce smooth, long stroke motion with desired properties. In particular, when equally spaced multiple units are arranged to push sinusoidal gear teeth on the output rod, the system exhibits unique collective behaviors thanks to “harmonic” effects of the multiple units. For example, although the force-displacement characteristics of individual units are highly nonlinear, the undesirable nonlinearity, including singularity, may be eliminated. Here we present harmonic analysis and control of a class of actuators consisting of multiple driving units engaged with a sinusoidal transmission, termed a harmonic poly-actuator. Through theoretical analysis we obtain 1) conditions on the unit arrangement to eliminate their nonlinearity from the output force, 2) control algorithms for coordinating the multiple units to generate a commanded force with desired force-displacement characteristics, and 3) a method for compensating for output force ripples due to possible misalignment and heterogeneity of individual units. The control algorithms are implemented on a prototype harmonic poly-actuator with six units of PSAs. Experiments demonstrate the unique features of the poly-actuator exploiting the harmonic properties of the system."
icra,None,Damping control of variable damping compliant actuators,"Navvab Kashiri,Gustavo A. Medrano-Cerda,Nikos G. Tsagarakis,,,","The development of variable impedance actuators (VIAs) has highlighted the need for proper control of passive impedance to attain suitable interaction performance. Until recently the regulation of the intrinsic impedance in VIAs is achieved in an open-loop model-based manner, mainly due to the lack of physical sensors capable of measuring impedance components such as stiffness and damping. Hence, the estimation of variable stiffness and damping has been explored, with the target to provide monitoring and feedback for potential closed loop control schemes. However, the use of the output of these estimators in the feedback control of variable impedance actuators has never been implemented/demonstrated in practice. This work contributes to the field with the development and experimental evaluation of a novel damping feedback control for a class of variable impedance compliant actuators able to realize a variable physical damping principle. The scheme is based on non-model-based damping estimation feedback to compensate model uncertainties in the action of an inner controller that uses a model-based friction estimator. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme to replicate with good fidelity constant and time-varying damping levels."
icra,None,Cylindrical cam mechanism for unlimited subsequent spring recruitment in Series-Parallel Elastic Actuators,"Glenn Mathijssen,Raphaël Furnémont,Simon Beckers,Tom Verstraten,,,","Series-Parallel Elastic Actuators (SPEA) enable variable recruitment of parallel springs and variable load cancellation. In previous work, we validated a MACCEPA-based SPEA prototype with a self-closing intermittent mechanism, to reduce motor load and improve energy efficiency. However, the mechanism only allowed for 4 parallel springs and a limited equilibrium angle range, which limits the variable load cancellation and operation range. Therefore, we developed a novel cylindrical cam mechanism for unlimited subsequent spring recruitment. This paper describes and validates the working principle of the cylindrical cam mechanism. Furthermore, the latest MACCEPA-based SPEA is presented with a maximum output torque of 40Nm and variable stiffness. Additive and traditional manufacturing techniques go hand in hand to overcome the actuator's complexity. The experiments endorse the working principle, demonstrate the variable stiffness, and prove the motor torque can be reduced to 5Nm while an output torque of 40Nm can be achieved."
icra,None,Differential dynamic programming for optimal estimation,"Marin Kobilarov,Duy-Nguyen Ta,Frank Dellaert,","This paper studies an optimization-based approach for solving optimal estimation and optimal control problems through a unified computational formulation. The goal is to perform trajectory estimation over extended past horizons and model-predictive control over future horizons by enforcing the same dynamics, control, and sensing constraints in both problems, and thus solving both problems with identical computational tools. Through such systematic estimation-control formulation we aim to improve the performance of autonomous systems such as agile robotic vehicles. This work focuses on sequential sweep trajectory optimization methods, and more specifically extends the method known as differential dynamic programming to the parameter-dependent setting in order to enable the solutions to general estimation and control problems."
icra,None,"Design, identification and experimental testing of a light-weight flexible-joint arm for aerial physical interaction","Burak Yüksel,Saber Mahboubi,Cristian Secchi,Heinrich H. Bülthoff,,","In this paper we introduce the design of a light-weight novel flexible-joint arm for light-weight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used both for safe physical interaction with the environment and it represents also a preliminary step in the direction of performing quick motions for tasks such as hammering or throwing. The actuator consists of an active pulley driven by a rotational servo motor, a passive pulley which is attached to a rigid link, and the elastic connections (springs) between these two pulleys. We identify the physical parameters of the system, and use an optimal control strategy to maximize its velocity by taking advantage of elastic components. The prototype can be extended to a light-weight variable stiffness actuator. The flexible-joint arm is applied on a quadrotor, to be used in aerial physical interaction tasks, which implies that the elastic components can also be used for stable interaction absorbing the interactive disturbances which might damage the flying system and its hardware. The design is validated through several experiments, and future developments are discussed in the paper."
icra,None,PlanIt: A crowdsourcing approach for learning to plan paths from large scale preference feedback,"Ashesh Jain,Debarghya Das,Jayesh K. Gupta,Ashutosh Saxena,","We consider the problem of learning user preferences over robot trajectories for environments rich in objects and humans. This is challenging because the criterion defining a good trajectory varies with users, tasks and interactions in the environment. We represent trajectory preferences using a cost function that the robot learns and uses it to generate good trajectories in new environments. We design a crowdsourcing system - PlanIt, where non-expert users label segments of the robot's trajectory. PlanIt allows us to collect a large amount of user feedback, and using the weak and noisy labels from PlanIt we learn the parameters of our model. We test our approach on 122 different environments for robotic navigation and manipulation tasks. Our extensive experiments show that the learned cost function generates preferred trajectories in human environments. Our crowdsourcing system is publicly available for the visualization of the learned costs and for providing preference feedback: http://planit.cs.cornell.edu."
icra,None,Predicting human reaching motion in collaborative tasks using Inverse Optimal Control and iterative re-planning,"Jim Mainprice,Rafi Hayne,Dmitry Berenson,","To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces, it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function which “explains” the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example trajectories from two participants performing a collaborative assembly task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict a human's motion for a given task by iteratively replanning a trajectory for a 23 DoF human kinematic model using the STOMP algorithm with the learned cost function in the presence of a moving collaborator. Our results suggest that our method outperforms baseline methods and generalizes well for tasks similar to those that were demonstrated."
icra,None,Speeding up heuristic computation in planning with Experience Graphs,"Mike Phillips,Maxim Likhachev,","Experience Graphs have been shown to accelerate motion planning using parts of previous paths in an A* framework. Experience Graphs work by computing a new heuristic for weighted A* search on top of the domain's original heuristic and the edges in an Experience Graph. The new heuristic biases the search toward relevant prior experience and uses the original heuristic for guidance otherwise. In previous work, Experience Graphs were always built on top of domain heuristics which were computed by dynamic programming (a lower dimensional version of the original planning problem). When the original heuristic is computed this way the Experience Graph heuristic can be computed very efficiently. However, there are many commonly used heuristics in planning that are not computed in this fashion, such as euclidean distance. While the Experience Graph heuristic can be computed using these heuristics, it is not efficient, and in many cases the heuristic computation takes much of the planning time. In this work, we present a more efficient way to use these heuristics for motion planning problems by making use of popular nearest neighbor algorithms. Experimentally, we show an average 8 times reduction in heuristic computation time, resulting in overall planning time being reduced by 66%. with no change in the expanded states or resulting path."
icra,None,Experience-based planning with sparse roadmap spanners,"David Coleman,Ioan A. Şucan,Mark Moll,Kei Okada,Nikolaus Correll,","We present an experience-based planning framework called Thunder that learns to reduce computation time required to solve high-dimensional planning problems in varying environments. The approach is especially suited for large configuration spaces that include many invariant constraints, such as those found with whole body humanoid motion planning. Experiences are generated using probabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which provides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space, making storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with respect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past experience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in individual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more opportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of the experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of dynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing query resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom humanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based planner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments with variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that Thunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning from scratch. Thunder also uses 98.8% less memory to store its experiences after 10,000 trials when compared to Lightning. Our framework is implemented and freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library."
icra,None,A novel approach to dynamic movement imitation based on quadratic programming,"Carlos Cardoso,Lorenzo Jamone,Alexandre Bernardino,","This paper proposes a novel approach to generate trajectories that generalize given demonstrations according to optimality criteria. By formulating the problem as a quadratic program we can efficiently incorporate constraints to adapt to new desired motion requirements while achieving the main goal of matching the acceleration profile of the demonstration. This makes our method particularly suited for the imitation and generalization of trajectories such as hitting movements, where it is crucial to maintain the dynamic traits of the demonstration while respecting strict requirements for the goals position, velocity and time. Our method draws inspiration from the Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) framework, preserving its desirable properties of flexibility and rejection of disturbances during execution. Moreover, it offers an higher degree of control on the generated solution, allowing for example i) to limit the instantaneous positions, velocities and accelerations during the whole trajectory, and ii) to add intermediate way points that were not present in the demonstration. With current state-of-the-art solvers of quadratic programs, a problem with hundreds of parameters can be solved in tens of milliseconds in a standard computer, allowing practical applications. Our methodology results in trajectories with a very good approximation of the shape traits of the demonstration, with additional flexibility in specifying constraints of the generated trajectory."
icra,None,Lazy validation of Experience Graphs,"Victor Hwang,Mike Phillips,Siddhartha Srinivasa,Maxim Likhachev,","Many robot applications involve lifelong planning in relatively static environments e.g. assembling objects or sorting mail in an office building. In these types of scenarios, the robot performs many tasks over a long period of time. Thus, the time required for computing a motion plan becomes a significant concern, prompting the need for a fast and efficient motion planner. Since these environments remain similar in between planning requests, planning from scratch is wasteful. Recently, Experience Graphs (E-Graphs) were proposed to accelerate the planning process by reusing parts of previously computed paths to solve new motion planning queries more efficiently. This work describes a method to improve planning times with E-Graphs given changes in the environment by lazily evaluating the validity of past experiences during the planning process. We show the improvements with our method in a single-arm manipulation domain with simulations on the PR2 robot."
icra,None,Towards a data-driven approach to human preferences in motion planning,"Arjun Menon,Pooja Kacker,Sachin Chitta,","Co-robots, i.e. robots that work close to people, will need to account for the preferences and expectations of their human co-workers in executing trajectories or actions. Consistent, legible and predictable trajectories are a key factor in making humans comfortable around robots. In this work, we take a data-driven approach towards designing robot trajectories that are more acceptable to human co-workers and observers. We use an online survey to ask people to rate multiple robot trajectories generated in a variety of environments. We compute a large set of features for each trajectory, also taking into account environment information. We use a combination of the features and the survey ratings to learn a classifier that predicts the rating for a new trajectory based on the learned human-observer preferences. The classifier also helps identify and highlight the most important features that influence people's ratings of the trajectories. Finally, we discuss how a data-driven approach using the results of this analysis can be used to help design better trajectories that are more acceptable to people."
icra,None,Toward a real-time framework for solving the kinodynamic motion planning problem,"Ross Allen,Marco Pavone,","In this paper we propose a framework combining techniques from sampling-based motion planning, machine learning, and trajectory optimization to address the kinodynamic motion planning problem in real-time environments. This framework relies on a look-up table that stores precomputed optimal solutions to boundary value problems (assuming no obstacles), which form the directed edges of a precomputed motion planning roadmap. A sampling-based motion planning algorithm then leverages such a precomputed roadmap to compute online an obstacle-free trajectory. Machine learning techniques are employed to minimize the number of online solutions to boundary value problems required to compute the neighborhoods of the start state and goal regions. This approach is demonstrated to reduce online planning times up to six orders of magnitude. Simulation results are presented and discussed. Problem-specific framework modifications are then discussed that would allow further computation time reductions."
icra,None,A non-rigid point and normal registration algorithm with applications to learning from demonstrations,"Alex X. Lee,Max A. Goldstein,Shane T. Barratt,Pieter Abbeel,","Recent work [1], [2], [3] has shown promising results in learning from demonstrations for the manipulation of deformable objects. Their approach finds a non-rigid registration between points in the demonstration scene and points in the test scene. This registration is then extrapolated and applied to the gripper motions in the demonstration scene to obtain the gripper motions for the test scene. If more than one demonstration is available, a quality score for the non-rigid registration is used to determine the best matching training scene. For many manipulation tasks, however, the gripper's direction of approach with respect to the objects' surface normals is important in order to succeed at the task. This prior work only registers points across scenes and does not register the surface normals, often leading to warps between scenes that are inappropriate for transfer of manipulation primitives. The main contributions of this paper are (i) An algorithm for non-rigid registration that considers both points and normals, and (ii) An evaluation of this registration approach in the context of learning from demonstrations for robotic manipulation. Our experiments, which consider an insertion task in simulation and also knot-tying and towel-folding executions in a PR2, show that incorporating normals results in improved performance and qualitatively better grasps."
icra,None,Encoderless position control of a two-link robot manipulator,"Petar Kormushev,Yiannis Demiris,Darwin G. Caldwell,","Encoders have been an inseparable part of robots since the very beginning of modern robotics in the 1950s. As a result, the foundations of robot control are built on the concepts of kinematics and dynamics of articulated rigid bodies, which rely on explicitly measuring the robot configuration in terms of joint angles - done by encoders. In this paper, we propose a radically new concept for controlling robots called Encoderless Robot Control (EnRoCo). The concept is based on our hypothesis that it is possible to control a robot without explicitly measuring its joint angles, by measuring instead the effects of the actuation on its end-effector. To prove the feasibility of this unconventional control approach, we propose a proof-of-concept control algorithm for encoderless position control of a robot's end-effector in task space. We demonstrate a prototype implementation of this controller in a dynamics simulation of a two-link robot manipulator. The prototype controller is able to successfully control the robot's end-effector to reach a reference position, as well as to track continuously a desired trajectory. Notably, we demonstrate how this novel controller can cope with something that traditional control approaches fail to do: adapt on-the-fly to changes in the kinematics of the robot, such as changing the lengths of the links."
icra,None,Automated robotic manipulation of individual sub-micro particles using a dual probe setup inside the scanning electron microscope,"Sören Zimmermann,Tobias Tiemerding,Olaf C. Haenssler,Sergej Fatikow,","Micro- and nanosized objects aligned in specific spatial order are of great interest for applications in photonics and nanoelectronics. In particular, piezo-actuated robotic setups are promising tools to arrange and manipulate these objects individually. However, automated robotic processing on the sub-micron scale remains challenging due to the force scaling laws and the limited possibilities in terms of control. This paper presents the current progress on fully-automated pick-and-place routines of individual colloidal particles using a dedicated dual-probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope. Applying tailored probes in combination with image processing of the visual feedback provided by the microscope allow for complex automation sequences. The limits of the current technique are highlighted and the challenges for automated processing of progressively smaller particles are discussed."
icra,None,Modelling and control of optical manipulation for cell rotation,"Mingyang Xie,James K. Mills,Xiangpeng Li,Yong Wang,Dong Sun,","Optical tweezers has become a powerful tool in automated cell transportation control and has been used in a variety of biological applications. The use of optical tweezers for cell surgery has great potential for various biomedical applications such as microinjection, organelle extraction and modification, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In these cell surgical manipulation tasks, the cell of interest must be oriented properly such that the desired component, e.g., the polar-body or organelles, can be visualized by optical microscopy; thus cell rotation becomes a necessary procedure. Currently, cell rotational control can be carried out by laser tools that are usually handled by skilled people. The open-loop manual operation cannot be readily used for applications requiring precise and high throughput cell rotational control. This highlights the need of developing an automated controlled robot manipulator to rotate biological cells more accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a cell surgery system that utilizes two optical traps, generated by robotically controlled holographic optical tweezers (HOT), to manipulate the cell for rotation, where the optical tweezers functions as special robot manipulators. Through dynamic modeling using T-matrix approach, the relationship between the applied torques and the spherical coordinates of the optical tweezers is characterized. A rotational controller is further developed to rotate the cell to the pre-desired orientation accurately. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
icra,None,Detection of contact force transients in robotic assembly,"Andreas Stolt,Magnus Linderoth,Anders Robertsson,Rolf Johansson,","A robotic assembly task is usually implemented as a sequence of simple motions, and the transitions between the motions are made when some events occur. These events can usually be detected with thresholds on some signal, but faster response is possible by detecting the transient on that signal. This paper considers the problem of detecting these transients. A force-controlled assembly task is used as an experimental case, and transients in measured force/torque data are considered. A systematic approach to train machine-learning based classifiers is presented. The classifiers are further implemented in the assembly task, resulting in a 15%reduction of the total assembly time."
icra,None,Supervisors and their simplification in automated manufacturing systems via Petri nets,"HeSuan Hu,Chen Chen,Yang Liu,Yan Yang,","Most contemporary manufacturing systems appear as complex event-driven automation facilities. Supervisor synthesis and simplification are fundamental in automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). From design and implementation standpoints, it is preferable to decrease supervisor scales so as to mitigate their realization expense. Ordinary and general Petri nets are considered as powerful formalisms to describe, analyze, and control AMSs. The former is concise while the latter is compact. By considering both cases, our approach shows some properties so as to disclose their rationales with regard to liveness enforcement. Many control methodologies are developed in the context of the ordinary ones. They are straightforward but might be unadaptable to the general ones. This work develops new theory in this perspective. Some comparison and contrast survey has been demonstrated in order to clarify their common theoretical basis and distinct supervisory effect. In accordance to a thorough study, a novel simplification method is developed so as to unify both cases and facilitate their application. Experimental results show that the developed strategy is effective and efficient when simplifying supervisors."
icra,None,"Design, modeling and control of a modular contactless wafer handling system","Bassem Dahroug,Guillaume J. Laurent,Valérian Guelpa,Nadine Le Fort-Piat,","In the photovoltaic solar cell industry as in the semiconductor industry, efforts to reduce the thickness of silicon wafers are in progress. Wafer damage and breakage during handling can lead to unacceptable yields and alternative solutions have to be proposed. This paper presents a modular contact-free wafer handling system that responds to the industrial requirements in terms of throughput and flexibility. The system is based on simple unidirectional modules that can be assembled together to form the desired trajectory. A complete and accurate physical model of the modular system describing the motion of the wafer transported by directed air-jets is proposed. A decentralized control at the block level is realized to damp the object motion. The experimental results show a great reduction of the response time compared to free motion and a standard deviation of the servo error below the millimeter. In addition, simulations show that a 150 mm wafer could reach a speed up to 2.9 m/s on large conveyors."
icra,None,Integrated path planning and power management for solar-powered unmanned ground vehicles,"Adam Kaplan,Paul Uhing,Nathaniel Kingry,Ran Dai Adam,","This paper examines an integrated path planning and power management problem for a solar-powered unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). The proposed method seeks to minimize the travel time of the UGV through an area with a known energy density by designing an optimal path and allocating the vehicle's power among its electrical components, while the UGV operates under strict power constraints and harvests ambient environmental energy along the designed path. A scalar field is first established to evaluate the solar radiation density at discrete locations. A modified Particle Swarm Optimization method is applied to search for a minimal time path wherein the energy gathered is equal to or greater than the energy expended. The proposed modeling and optimization strategy is verified through computer simulation and experimental demonstration."
icra,None,Injected 3D electrical traces in additive manufactured parts with low melting temperature metals,"John P. Swensen,Lael U. Odhner,Brandon Araki,Aaron M. Dollar,","While techniques exist for the rapid prototyping of mechanical and electrical components separately, this paper describes a method where commercial Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques can be used to concurrently construct the mechanical structure and electronic circuits in a robotic or mechatronic system. The technique involves printing hollow channels within parts that are then filled with a low melting point liquid metal alloy that solidifies upon cooling to form electrical traces. This method is compatible with most conventional fused deposition modeling and stereolithography machines, and requires no modification to an existing printer, though the technique could easily be incorporated into multi-material machines. Three primary considerations are explored using the a commercial fused deposition manufacturing (FDM) process as a testbed: material and manufacturing process parameters, simplified injection fluid mechanics, and automatic part generation using standard printed circuit board software tools. As demonstration of the ability to embed circuit in RP parts, a differential-drive robot is printed, populated with discrete electronic components, and injected to create a fully functional robot."
icra,None,An automated robotic system for high-speed microinjection of Caenorhabditis elegans,"Xianke Dong,Pengfei Song,Xinyu Liu,","The tiny nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has long been a popular model organism for genetic, developmental, and biochemical studies in which worm microinjection plays a critical role. This paper presents an automated robotic system for high-speed injection of C. elegans with an efficiency more than 10 times faster than that of a proficient injection technician. To facilitate the injection process, a multilayer, hydraulically-controlled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device is developed to rapidly load, immobilize, flush, sort and collect individual worms. In addition, a newly proposed contact detection algorithm is adopted to find the optimal injection position along the z axis within the microscope view field. The direction and location of the needle tip are identified online based on an effective image processing algorithm. According to continuous injection of 40 worms, our system is able to perform worm injection at a speed of 6.6 worms per minute with a pre-sorting success rate of 77.5% (post sorting: 100%). The superior performance provided by the system will significantly facilitate large-scale transgenic studies and biomolecule screening on C. elegans."
icra,None,Design and evaluation of the Bi-directional Clutched Parallel Elastic Actuator (BIC-PEA),"Michiel Plooij,Marvin van Nunspeet,Martijn Wisse,Heike Vallery,","Parallel elastic actuators (PEAs) have shown the ability to reduce the energy consumption of robots. The problem with regular PEAs is that it is not possible to freely choose at which instant or configuration to store or release energy. This paper introduces the concept and the design of the Bi-directional Clutched Parallel Elastic Actuator (BIC-PEA*), which reduces the energy consumption of robots by loading and unloading the parallel spring in a controlled manner. The concept of the BIC-PEA consists of a spring that is mounted between the two outgoing axes of a differential mechanism. Those axes can also be locked to the ground by two locking mechanisms. At any position, the BIC-PEA can store the kinetic energy of a joint in the spring such that the joint is decelerated to zero velocity. The spring energy can then be released, accelerating the joint in any desired direction. In our prototype of 202 g, the energy that can be stored in the spring is 0.77 J. When disengaged, the friction that the mechanism adds is negligible. The current maximum over-all efficiency is 62 %, which is about 55% more than what generally can be achieved by recapturing the energy electrically. Its relatively high efficiency and controllability make the BIC-PEA a promising concept for reducing the energy consumption of robots."
icra,None,On the role of robot configuration in Cartesian stiffness control,"Arash Ajoudani,Nikos G. Tsagarakis,Antonio Bicchi,","The stiffness ellipsoid, i.e. the locus of task-space forces obtained corresponding to a deformation of unit norm in different directions, has been extensively used as a powerful representation of robot interaction capabilities. The size and shape of the stiffness ellipsoid at a given end-effector posture are influenced by both joint control parameters and - for redundant manipulators - by the chosen redundancy resolution configuration. As is well known, impedance control techniques ideally provide control parameters which realize any desired shape of the Cartesian stiffness ellipsoid at the end-effector in an arbitrary non-singular configuration, so that arm geometry selection could appear secondary. This definitely contrasts with observations on how humans control their arm stiffness, who in fact appear to predominantly use arm configurations to shape the stiffness ellipsoid. To understand this discrepancy, we provide a more complete analysis of the task-space force/deformation behavior of redundant arms, which explains why arm geometry also plays a fundamental role in interaction capabilities of a torque controlled robot. We show that stiffness control of realistic robot models with bounds on joint torques can't indeed achieve arbitrary stiffness ellipsoids at any given arm configuration. We first introduce the notion of maximum allowable Cartesian force/displacement (“stiffness feasibility”) regions for a compliant robot. We show that different robot configurations modify such regions, and explore the role of different configurations in defining the performance limits of Cartesian stiffness controllers. On these bases, we design a stiffness control method that suitably exploits both joint control parameters and redundancy resolution to achieve desired task-space interaction behavior."
icra,None,A clutch mechanism for switching between position and stiffness control of a variable stiffness actuator,"Marco Cempini,Matteo Fumagalli,Nicola Vitiello,Stefano Stramigioli,","Variable stiffness actuators (VSA) are fostered in robotics for their capability to address physical interaction with a physically adjustable compliance, being advantageous in terms of efficiency, safety and adaptability to unknown environments. Here we introduce the concept of a switching VSA (sVSA), in which a single actuator is used to control the position or the stiffness of a robotic joint according to a mechanical switch. Despite not allowing simultaneous control of both quantities, this architecture has the potential to make the design lighter, requiring one continuously powered actuator, controllable in position, and one additional switch, activated only occasionally between two limit stages: the advantages are the separation of the motors power requirements and a simpler control. A first prototype of a 1-DoF revolute variable-stiffness joint has been built, based on the vsaUT-II developed at the University of Twente, with a novel clutch mechanism allowing continuous and efficient switching. The prototype proved functionality and feasibility of the sVSA concept."
icra,None,Design and control of a novel multi-state compliant safe joint for robotic surgery,"Zerui Wang,Peng Li,David Navarro-Alarcon,Hiu Man Yip,Yun-hui Liu,,,","In this paper, we propose a novel design of compliant safe joint, which has flexibility when the work load exceeds a predefined threshold. The compliance is generated by a spring. We design a special transmission mechanism to convert axial motion into circumferential motion such that the linear compliance can be converted into circular one. When the end-effector of a surgical robot actuated by the compliant safe joints collides with patient's body, the compliance of the joints will protect the patient by absorbing part of the collision energy. Because of the system's special mechanical structure, the control methods should be different when it works under different states. We propose a simple algorithm to choose control methods so that the system can work both under rigid and flexible states with different controllers. We have built a prototype to validate the design and the controller."
icra,None,Use of the nonlinear observability rank condition for improved parametric estimation,"Matthew Travers,Howie Choset,","The correct way to design controllers for dynamic robots is still very much an open question. This is in a large part due to the complexity and uncertainty in modeling their nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we focus on deriving concise dynamic expressions for a particular class of robots that can be used to better reduce uncertainty with respect to unknown parameters in realtime. We accomplish this by using an extended Kalman filtering framework in conjunction with an online controller that continuously maximizes a local measure of nonlinear observability. The main novel contribution of this work is that we directly use the nonlinear observability rank condition to derive the measure of observability at each time step. We are able to make this extension in part by focusing on serial-chain systems and exploiting the geometric structure in their dynamic models. In particular, we derive concise, closed-form and exact analytical representations for the forward dynamics, linearization, and nonlinear observability rank condition of a fixed-base serial manipulator with actively controlled elastic joints. An example is presented in which the spring constants and damping coefficients for a series-elastic actuated manipulator are estimated using the online observability maximizing techniques we derive."
icra,None,A comparison of series and parallel elasticity in a monoped hopper,"Yevgeniy Yesilevskiy,Weitao Xi,C. David Remy,","In this paper we use optimal control on a geared electric DC motor to compare the energetic efficiency of a simulation of conceptual monoped hoppers with either parallel elastic actuation (PEA) or series elastic actuation (SEA). The energy is measured using three cost functions: positive actuator work, electrical losses, and positive electrical work. For PEA, the presence of the motor inertia in the collision losses leads to increased collision losses at large transmission ratios, which lead to energetically costly compensatory strategies where the SEA is at its most efficient. At small transmission ratios, the motor force increases for both cases, leading to increased thermal losses. In agreement with those theoretical predictions, our work shows that for positive actuator work and positive electrical work the optimal parameter choice for SEA is significantly more energetically efficient than the optimal choice for PEA. For electrical losses, a suitable choice of the transmission ratio can lead to negligible cost values for both actuator concepts."
icra,None,SEA force/torque servo control with model-based robust motion control and link-side motion feedback,"Sunkyum Yoo,Wan Kyun Chung,","A series elastic actuator (SEA) consists of a system with an intrinsically compliant mechanism, and introduces the possibility of external force/torque sensing and control. However, this mechanism is also known to reduce torque servo-control bandwidth and to separate link-side dynamics from actuator-side dynamics. The conventional solution to overcoming reduced actuation bandwidth and separated link motion problems is to increase the control gain, which is limited by stability problems and actuator saturation. Here, we demonstrate that treating the actuator side as a near-ideal position source gives the compliance-independent actuation bandwidth of an SEA, so that separated link-side motion can be simply but effectively compensated. Based on these observations, we developed an SEA force/torque servo controller that consists of actuator-side robust motion control and link-side motion feedback. We performed comparison experiments with conventional cascaded two-loop SEA torque servo control using a rotational flexible-joint test-bed, and the results demonstrated that the proposed control strategy yields a wider bandwidth and more robust link motion."
icra,None,Design principle of wing rotational hinge stiffness,"Fan Fei,Jesse A. Roll,Xinyan Deng,","A design principle for selecting the stiffness of a wing rotational flexure hinge on bio-inspired flapping wing robots is presented. In this work, a systematic approach of selecting rotational stiffness values such that the primary mode of resonance occurs at harmonics of the wing stroke frequency is proposed. Using the quasi-steady aerodynamic model as a basis, simulations were performed to assess the effects of wing hinge stiffness on the rotational dynamics, while also evaluating effects on the mean lift coefficient. Based on the results from simulation, an operating mode for the optimal wing hinge stiffness is proposed. As verification, test wings incorporating a flexible rotational hinge were fabricated from laser machined composites and tested at a range of flapping frequencies. Wing kinematics were then extracted from high speed video and the resulting lift generation was evaluated. Experimental data from wing-hinge stiffnesses designed such that the primary mode of rotational resonance occurs near twice the flapping frequency showed near optimal cycle-averaged lift at targeted frequencies and low sensitivity to wing parameter variation. As a result, for a given set of vehicle parameters, the proposed principle serves as design guideline from which an initial rotational hinge stiffness can be selected and iterated to achieve optimal lift."
icra,None,Directional efficiency in geared transmissions: Characterization of backdrivability towards improved proprioceptive control,"Albert Wang,Sangbae Kim,","This paper introduces the phenomenon of directional efficiency, a property of spur gear transmissions in which the coefficient of torque dependent efficiency is function of the power flow direction; the efficiency in the step-up direction differs from that of step-down. Understanding the directional efficiency is important in robot design where the mechanical impedance of the transmission significantly affects the dynamics of physical interaction with the environment. This paper is the first to address `backdrivability' by investigating directional efficiency on a high gear ratio robotic actuator, industrial servo gearboxes and over a family of gears. The kinematic model shows that a single pair of gears operates at higher efficiency in step-down than in step-up and the effect is confirmed in experiment, albeit with discrepancy in the magnitude of difference. Experimental results show that step-down and step-up directional efficiency are 98% and 96% respectively for a PIC DESIGNS 6:1 gearbox over the range of tested velocities. Additionally the overall energy efficiencies of the Dynamixel robotic servo motor with a gear ratio of 248:1 are approximately 75% and 70% for step-down and step-up respectively over a range of tested velocities. For the Dynamixel servo actuator, modeling with directional efficiency coefficients reduces error in predicted output force to 2-4% compared to a 4-8% with a single efficiency coefficient and 30% for models without friction."
icra,None,Autonomous navigation of generic monocular quadcopter in natural environment,"Kumar Bipin,Vishakh Duggal,K. Madhava Krishna,","Autonomous navigation of generic monocular quadcopter in the natural environment requires sophisticated mechanism for perception, planning and control. In this work, we have described a framework which performs perception using monocular camera and generates minimum time collision free trajectory and control for any commercial quadcopter flying through cluttered unknown environment. The proposed framework first utilizes supervised learning approach to estimate the dense depth map for video stream obtained from frontal monocular camera. This depth map is initially transformed into Ego Dynamic Space and subsequently, is used for computing locally traversable way-points utilizing binary integer programming methodology. Finally, trajectory planning and control module employs a convex programming technique to generate collision-free trajectory which follows these way-points and produces appropriate control inputs for the quadcopter. These control inputs are computed from the generated trajectory in each update. Hence, they are applicable to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive controller. We have demonstrated the applicability of our system in controlled indoors and in unstructured natural outdoors environment."
icra,None,Efficient visual exploration and coverage with a micro aerial vehicle in unknown environments,"Lionel Heng,Alkis Gotovos,Andreas Krause,Marc Pollefeys,","In this paper, we propose a novel and computationally efficient algorithm for simultaneous exploration and coverage with a vision-guided micro aerial vehicle (MAV) in unknown environments. This algorithm continually plans a path that allows the MAV to fulfil two objectives at the same time while avoiding obstacles: observe as much unexplored space as possible, and observe as much of the surface of the environment as possible given viewing angle and distance constraints. The former and latter objectives are known as the exploration and coverage problems respectively. Our algorithm is particularly useful for automated 3D reconstruction at the street level and in indoor environments where obstacles are omnipresent. By solving the exploration problem, we maximize the size of the reconstructed model. By solving the coverage problem, we maximize the completeness of the model. Our algorithm leverages the state lattice concept such that the planned path adheres to specified motion constraints. Furthermore, our algorithm is computationally efficient and able to run on-board the MAV in real-time. We assume that the MAV is equipped with a forward-looking depth-sensing camera in the form of either a stereo camera or RGB-D camera. We use simulation experiments to validate our algorithm. In addition, we show that our algorithm achieves a significantly higher level of coverage as compared to an exploration-only approach while still allowing the MAV to fully explore the environment."
icra,None,Exploration and topological map building in unknown environments,"Bayram C. Akdeniz,H. Iṣıl Bozma,","This paper is on simultaneous exploration and topological map building in completely unknown environments. We propose an approach that consists of a continuous loop of local decision-making (where potential search directions are added to the current node) and global decision-making (where the robot moves along one of these directions and adds possibly a new node to the map ) using the previously proposed bubble space representation. As the robot switches between the two in a continual manner, it creates a coarse graph representation of the environment. There is a node for every explored location with a set of associated edges that either indicate potential search directions or connect to the other explored locations. The so-far constructed topological map contains all the required information in regards to deciding where to move with comparatively low memory requirements. Experimental results with an extensive real data set demonstrate that large terrains can be explored and mapped efficiently using this approach."
icra,None,Stigmergy at work: Planning and navigation for a service robot on an RFID floor,"Ali Abdul Khaliq,Alessandro Saffiotti,","Many species in nature store information in the environment to facilitate the performance of tasks and enable cooperation. This principle is known as stigmergy. Stigmergy has been widely studied in robotic systems, but so far mostly in simulation or in laboratory proofs of concept. In this paper, we propose a stigmergic approach to goal-directed navigation that can be used for navigation of a full-scale robotic system in a real apartment. A team of small ePuck robots build a set of navigation maps directly onto an RFID floor, where each map is associated to one predefined goal. The information stored in the floor can then used by a mid-size robot or by a larger domestic robot to perform safe navigation toward the predefined goals. To navigate, robots only rely on the information read from the RFID tags: in particular, they do not need to use an internal map or to perform self-localization. This results in robust and repeatable navigation with minimal hardware and software requirements."

Here, we seek to compute a schedule that will allow a fleet of agents to visit all targets of a given set while maximizing the frequency of visitation and maintaining a sufficient fuel capacity by refueling at depots. We also present a heuristic method to allow us to compute bounded suboptimal results in real time. The results produced by our algorithm will allow a team of robots to efficiently cover a given set of targets or tasks persistently over long periods of time, even when the cost to transition between tasks is dynamic."

We introduce a novel construct called the abstract map to link provided symbolic spatial information with observed symbolic information and actual places in the real world. Symbolic information is observed using a text recognition system that has been developed specifically for the application of reading door labels. In the study described in this paper, the robot was provided with a floor plan and a destination. The destination was specified by a room number, used both in the floor plan and on the door to the room. The robot autonomously navigated to the destination using its text recognition, abstract map, mapping, and path planning systems. The robot used the symbolic navigation system to determine an efficient path to the destination, and reached the goal in two different real-world environments. Simulation results show that the system reduces the time required to navigate to a goal when compared to random exploration."
icra,None,Semantic representation for navigation in large-scale environments,"Romain Drouilly,Patrick Rives,Benoit Morisset,","Mimicking human navigation is a challenging goal for autonomous robots. This requires to explicitly take into account not only geometric representation but also high-level interpretation of the environment. In this paper, we demonstrate the capability to infer a route in a global map by using semantics. Our approach relies on an object-based representation of the world automatically built by robots from spherical images. In addition, we propose a new approach to specify paths in terms of high-level robot actions. This path description provides robots with the ability to interact with humans in an intuitive way. We perform experiments on simulated and real-world data, demonstrating the ability of our approach to deal with complex large-scale outdoor environments whilst dealing with labelling errors."
icra,None,Now or later? Predicting and maximising success of navigation actions from long-term experience,"Jaime Pulido Fentanes,Bruno Lacerda,Tomáš Krajník,Nick Hawes,,","In planning for deliberation or navigation in real-world robotic systems, one of the big challenges is to cope with change. It lies in the nature of planning that it has to make assumptions about the future state of the world, and the robot's chances of successively accomplishing actions in this future. Hence, a robot's plan can only be as good as its predictions about the world. In this paper, we present a novel approach to specifically represent changes that stem from periodic events in the environment (e.g. a door being opened or closed), which impact on the success probability of planned actions. We show that our approach to model the probability of action success as a set of superimposed periodic processes allows the robot to predict action outcomes in a long-term data obtained in two real-life offices better than a static model. We furthermore discuss and showcase how this knowledge gathered can be successfully employed in a probabilistic planning framework to devise better navigation plans. The key contributions of this paper are (i) the formation of the spectral model of action outcomes from non-uniform sampling, the (ii) analysis of its predictive power using two long-term datasets, and (iii) the application of the predicted outcomes in an MDP-based planning framework."
icra,None,Automatic image scaling for place recognition in changing environments,"Edward Pepperell,Peter I. Corke,Michael J. Milford,","Robustness to variations in environmental conditions and camera viewpoint is essential for long-term place recognition, navigation and SLAM. Existing systems typically solve either of these problems, but invariance to both remains a challenge. This paper presents a training-free approach to lateral viewpoint- and condition-invariant, vision-based place recognition. Our successive frame patch-tracking technique infers average scene depth along traverses and automatically rescales views of the same place at different depths to increase their similarity. We combine our system with the condition-invariant SMART algorithm and demonstrate place recognition between day and night, across entire 4-lane-plus-median-strip roads, where current algorithms fail."
icra,None,Flow feature extraction for underwater robot localization: Preliminary results,"Naveed Muhammad,Nataliya Strokina,Gert Toming,Jeffrey Tuhtan,,,","Underwater robots conventionally use vision and sonar sensors for perception purposes, but recently bio-inspired sensors that can sense flow have been developed. In literature, flow sensing has been shown to provide useful information about an underwater object and its surroundings. In the light of this, we develop an underwater landmark recognition technique which is based on the extraction and comparison of compact flow features. The proposed features are based on frequency spectrum of a pressure signal acquired by a piezo-resistive sensor. We report experiments in semi-natural (human-made flume with obstacles) and natural (river) underwater conditions where the proposed technique successfully recognizes previously visited locations."

This paper presents an efficient multi-level motion controller that can be used to enhance underwater glider control systems or easily modified for additional sensing, computing, or other requirements for advanced automation design testing. The ultimate goal is to have a fleet of modular and inexpensive test platforms for addressing the issues that currently limit the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Producing a low-cost vehicle with maneuvering capabilities and a straightforward expansion path will permit easy experimentation and testing of different approaches to improve underwater automation."

Eustice,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,","This paper reports on a 3D photomosaicing pipeline using data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle performing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The pipeline projects and blends 2D imaging sonar data onto a large-scale 3D mesh that is either given a priori or derived from SLAM. Compared to other methods that generate a 2D-only mosaic, our approach produces 3D models that are more structurally representative of the environment being surveyed. Additionally, our system leverages recent work in underwater SLAM using sparse point clouds derived from Doppler velocity log range returns to relax the need for a prior model. We show that the method produces reasonably accurate surface reconstruction and blending consistency, with and without the use of a prior mesh. We experimentally evaluate our approach with a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) performing inspection of a large underwater ship hull."

Smith,","This paper presents a novel path planning method for minimizing the energy consumption of an autonomous underwater vehicle subjected to time varying ocean disturbances and forecast model uncertainty. The algorithm determines 4-Dimensional path candidates using Nonlinear Robust Model Predictive Control (NRMPC) and solutions optimised using A*-like algorithms. Vehicle performance limits are incorporated into the algorithm with disturbances represented as spatial and temporally varying ocean currents with a bounded uncertainty in their predictions. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulations using a 4-Dimensional, spatially distributed time-series predictive ocean current model. Results show the combined NRMPC and A* approach is capable of generating energy-efficient paths which are resistant to both dynamic disturbances and ocean model uncertainty."
icra,None,Online path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles in unknown environments,"Juan David Hernández,Eduard Vidal,Guillem Vallicrosa,Enric Galceran,,","We present a framework for planning collision-free paths online for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in unknown environments. It is composed of three main modules (mapping, planning and mission handler) that incrementally explore the environment while solving start-to-goal queries. We use an octree-based representation of the environment and we extend the optimal rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT*) using concepts of anytime algorithms and lazy collision evaluation, thus including the capability to replan paths according to nearby obstacles perceived during the execution of the mission. To validate our approach, we plan paths for the SPARUS-II AUV, a torpedo-shaped vehicle performing autonomous missions in a 2-dimensional workspace. We demonstrate its feasibility with the SPARUS-II AUV in both simulation and real-world in-water trials."
icra,None,Locomotion and elastodynamics model of an underwater shell-like soft robot,"Federico Renda,Francesco Giorgio-Serchi,Frederic Boyer,Cecilia Laschi,","This paper reports on the development and validation of the elastodynamics model of an innovative underwater soft-bodied robot inspired by cephalopods. The vehicle, for which the model is devised, is propelled by a discontinuous activation routine which entails the collapse of an elastic shell via cable transmission and its following passive re-inflation under the action of the elastic energy stored in the shell walls. Activation routine and thrust characterization have been determined to depend massively on the capability of the shell to elastically return to its unstrained state, hence an accurate description of the dynamics of the shell during all stages of actuation and at various degrees of deformation is essential. The model, based on a geometrically exact Cosserat theory, is validated against measurement achieved from an ad-hoc experimental apparatus, bringing evidence of its aptness at capturing the key parameters of the system. Eventually the model is employed for simulating a proper propulsion routine in water demonstrating that, upon suitable parametrization of the internal and external hydrodynamics, it can reliably be employed for the realistic quantitative characterization of the cephalopod-inspired robot."

This paper presents the first research into developing an underwater electric current communication system and integrating the system into a small robotic fish. It is notable for its potential for a group of underwater robots communicating within a short distance range in conditions where optical and acoustic methods would meet difficulty. The working principle of the electric current communication is explained by a simplified electric dipole model. After that, systematic design of the electric current communication system is proposed for underwater robots. Communication experiments with the robotic fish demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed electric current communication system. The experimental results show that a remote control system can communicate underwater with our robotic fish over a distance of three meters by use of electric current communication."
icra,None,Computationally efficient underwater navigational strategy in electrically heterogeneous environments using electrolocation,"Kedar D. Dimble,Badri N. Ranganathan,Jishnu Keshavan,J. Sean Humbert,","Weakly electric fish use a navigational technique called electrolocation to investigate their surroundings for predator, prey and obstacles. Obstacles and other global stimuli are perceived as perturbations to the fish's self-generated electric field, which provide relevant navigational cues to the fish. In this work a control strategy based on electrolocation for performing obstacle avoidance in electrically heterogeneous environments is presented and validated. The control strategy developed for a straight tunnel is shown to be robust to small variations in the tunnel width. This justifies its application to other heterogeneous corridor-like environments. Static output feedback control is shown to achieve the desired goal of reflexive obstacle avoidance in such environments in simulation and experimentation. The proposed approach is computationally inexpensive and readily implementable on a small scale underwater vehicle, making underwater autonomous navigation feasible in real-time."
icra,None,Vision-based 3D motion reconstruction of octopus arm swimming and comparison with an 8-arm underwater robot,"Asimina Kazakidi,Xenophon Zabulis,Dimitris P. Tsakiris,","The octopus uses the arm-swimming behavior primarily for escape, defense, or foraging. This mode of locomotion is comprised of two strokes, with the arms opening slowly and closing rapidly, and generally results in considerable propulsive acceleration. In light of the recent development by our group of an octopus-like eight-arm underwater robot, we are interested to analyze the details of the biological arm swimming motion, in order to understand its kinematics. In this paper, we address methodological aspects of the 3D reconstruction process of octopus arm trajectories, based on computer vision, and present the resulting arm swimming movement of a benthic common octopus. The 3D trajectories of all eight octopus arms were tracked and analyzed, providing information about speed, acceleration and arm elongation. The animal's performance is then used for a direct comparison with our 8-arm robotic swimmer. The data obtained provide new kinematic information about this, relatively unknown, propulsive mode, which can be exploited for multi-functional underwater robots."
icra,None,Toward tissue penetration by MRI-powered millirobots using a self-assembled Gauss gun,"Aaron T. Becker,Ouajdi Felfoul,Pierre E. Dupont,","MRI-based navigation and propulsion of millirobots is a new and promising approach for minimally invasive therapies. The strong central field inside the scanner, however, precludes torque-based control. Consequently, prior propulsion techniques have been limited to gradient-based pulling through fluid-filled body lumens. This paper introduces a technique for generating large impulsive forces that can be used to penetrate tissue. The approach is based on navigating multiple robots to a desired location and using self-assembly to trigger the conversion of magnetic potential energy into sufficient kinetic energy to achieve penetration. The approach is illustrated through analytical modeling and experiments in a clinical MRI scanner."
icra,None,A spherical-magnet end-effector for robotic magnetic manipulation,"Samuel E. Wright,Arthur W. Mahoney,Katie M. Popek,Jake J.

This paper presents the spherical-actuator-magnet manipulator (SAMM), which is designed to replace or augment the singularity-prone spherical wrist used by prior permanent-magnet manipulation systems. The SAMM uses three omniwheels to enable holonomic control of a spherical magnet's heading and enable the magnet's instantaneous axis-of-rotation to be set arbitrarily. The SAMM performs closed-loop control of its dipole using field measurements obtained from Hall-effect sensors. We describe the operation and construction of the SAMM, develop and characterize a controller for the SAMM's spherical magnet, and demonstrate remote actuation of an untethered magnetic device in a lumen."
icra,None,A miniaturised robotic probe for real-time intraoperative fusion of ultrasound and endomicroscopy,"George Dwyer,Petros Giataganas,Philip Pratt,Michael Hughes,,","Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM) is a minimally invasive oncological resection procedure that utilises a natural orifice approach rather than the traditional abdominal or open approach. However, TEM has a significant recurrence rate due to incomplete excisions, which can possibly be attributed to the absence of intraoperative image guidance. The use of real-time histological data could allow the surgeons to assess the surgical margins intraoperatively and adjust the procedure accordingly. This paper presents the integration of endomicroscopy and ultrasound imaging through a robotically actuated instrument. Endomicroscopy can provide high resolution images at a surface level while ultrasound provides depth resolved information at a macroscopic level. Endomicroscopy scanning is achieved with a novel scanning approach featuring a passive force adaptive mechanism. The instrument is manipulated across the surgical workspace through an articulated flexible shaft. This results in the ability to perform large area mosaics coupled with ultrasound scanning. In addition, the use of endoscopic tracking is demonstrated, allowing three-dimensional reconstruction of the ultrasound data displayed onto the endoscopic view. An ex vivo study on porcine colon tissue has been performed, demonstrating the clinical applicability of the instrument."

Programming is difficult because human tissue is deformable and highly specular. Using the da Vinci Research Kit (DVRK) robotic surgical assistant, we explore a “Learning By Observation” (LBO) approach where we identify, segment, and parameterize motion sequences and sensor conditions to build a finite state machine (FSM) for each subtask. The robot then executes the FSM repeatedly to tune parameters and if necessary update the FSM structure. We evaluate the approach on two surgical subtasks: debridement of 3D Viscoelastic Tissue Phantoms (3d-DVTP), in which small target fragments are removed from a 3D viscoelastic tissue phantom; and Pattern Cutting of 2D Orthotropic Tissue Phantoms (2d-PCOTP), a step in the standard Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training suite, in which a specified circular area must be cut from a sheet of orthotropic tissue phantom. We describe the approach and physical experiments with repeatability of 96% for 50 trials of the 3d-DVTP subtask and 70% for 20 trials of the 2d-PCOTP subtask.

icra,None,An ankle-foot prosthesis emulator with control of plantarflexion and inversion-eversion torque,"Steven H. Collins,Myunghee Kim,Tianjian Chen,Tianyao Chen,","Ankle inversion-eversion compliance is an important feature of conventional prosthetic feet, and control of inversion, or roll, in robotic prostheses could improve balance for people with amputation. We designed a tethered ankle-foot prosthesis with two independently-actuated toes that are coordinated to provide plantarflexion and inversion-eversion torques. This configuration allows a simple lightweight structure with a total mass of 0.72 kg. Strain gages on the toes measure torque with less than 2.7% RMS error, while compliance in the Bowden cable tether provides series elasticity. Benchtop tests demonstrated a 90% rise time of less than 33 ms and peak torques of 180 N·m in plantarflexion and ±30 N·m in inversion-eversion. The phase-limited closedloop torque bandwidth is 20 Hz with a 90 N·m amplitude chirp in plantarflexion, and 24 Hz with a 20 N·m amplitude chirp in inversion-eversion. The system has low sensitivity to toe position disturbances at frequencies of up to 18 Hz. Walking trials with five values of constant inversion-eversion torque demonstrated RMS torque tracking errors of less than 3.7% in plantarflexion and less than 5.9% in inversion-eversion. These properties make the platform suitable for haptic rendering of virtual devices in experiments with humans, which may reveal strategies for improving balance or allow controlled comparisons of conventional prosthesis features. A similar morphology may be effective for autonomous devices."
icra,None,A virtual sensor for needle deflection estimation during soft-tissue needle insertion,"Thomas Lehmann,Carlos Rossa,Nawaid Usmani,Ronald Sloboda,,","A tissue-independent model to estimate needle deflection during insertion in soft tissue is presented in this paper. A force/torque sensor is connected to the needle base in order to measure forces and moments during insertion due to needle deflection. A static mechanical model, which is based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation and the balance of forces applied by the tissue onto the needle takes these force and moment measurements as input. The needle tip deflection can then be calculated based on the beam model undergoing these forces. Three different needle-tissue interaction models are presented. Their estimation performance is evaluated and experimentally compared by carrying out insertion experiments into phantom tissue. The experimental results show a precise estimate of needle tip deflection for a novel virtual sensor introduced in this work. The main advantage of this virtual sensor approach is that measurements obtained from the force/torque sensor are the only necessary model inputs. Furthermore, the approach does not rely on ultrasound or other image-based needle observation techniques. This makes the virtual sensor suitable for real-time feedback of needle tip deflection."
icra,None,"Design of two lightweight, high-bandwidth torque-controlled ankle exoskeletons","Kirby Ann Witte,Juanjuan Zhang,Rachel W. Jackson,Steven H. Collins,","Lower-limb exoskeletons capable of comfortably applying high torques at high bandwidth can be used to probe the human neuromuscular system and assist gait. We designed and built two tethered ankle exoskeletons with strong lightweight frames, comfortable three-point contact with the leg, and series elastic elements for improved torque control. Both devices have low mass (<; 0.88 kg), are modular, structurally compliant in selected directions, and instrumented to measure joint angle and torque. The exoskeletons are actuated by an off-board motor, and torque is controlled using a combination of proportional feedback and damping injection with iterative learning during walking tests. We tested closed-loop torque control by commanding 50 N·m and 20 N·m linear chirps in desired torque while the exoskeletons were worn by human users, and measured bandwidths greater than 16 Hz and 21 Hz, respectively. During walking trials, we demonstrated 120 N·m peak torque and 2.0 N·m RMS torque tracking error. These performance measures compare favorably with existing devices and with human ankle musculature, and show that these exoskeletons can be used to rapidly explore a wide range of control techniques and robotic assistance paradigms as elements of versatile, high-performance testbeds. Our results also provide insights into desirable properties of lower-limb exoskeleton hardware, which we expect to inform future designs."

The proposed mechanism eliminates the pre-tension of the tendons and minimizes the friction induced by the pre-tension, which causes inefficiency and a lack of safety. Furthermore, the slack enabling mechanism mechanically prevents the derailing of the tendon from the spool.

icra,None,Feed forward incision control for laser microsurgery of soft tissue,"Loris Fichera,Diego Pardo,Placido Illiano,Darwin G. Caldwell,Leonardo S. Mattos,","In this paper we present a feed forward controller to regulate the depth of laser incisions in soft tissue. Such a controller is compatible with the requirements of laser microsurgery, where space constraints limit the use of sensing devices. The controller is based on an inverse model that maps the desired incision depth to the required laser exposure time. This model is extracted from experimental data through the use of statistical learning methods. To prove the concept, the controller is implemented in a robot-assisted laser microsurgery system that enables precision control of exposure time and laser motion. The validity and the accuracy of the controller is verified experimentally on ex-vivo muscle tissue (chicken breast), revealing an RMSE of 0.12 mm for incisions ranging up to 1 mm. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be used to implement the automatic ablation of entire volumes of tissue, through the superposition of controlled laser incisions."
icra,None,Planning for decentralized control of multiple robots under uncertainty,"Christopher Amato,George Konidaris,Gabriel Cruz,Christopher A. Maynor,,,","This paper presents a probabilistic framework for synthesizing control policies for general multi-robot systems that is based on decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs). Dec-POMDPs are a general model of decision-making where a team of agents must cooperate to optimize a shared objective in the presence of uncertainty. Dec-POMDPs also consider communication limitations, so execution is decentralized. While Dec-POMDPs are typically intractable to solve for real-world problems, recent research on the use of macro-actions in Dec-POMDPs has significantly increased the size of problem that can be practically solved. We show that, in contrast to most existing methods that are specialized to a particular problem class, our approach can synthesize control policies that exploit any opportunities for coordination that are present in the problem, while balancing uncertainty, sensor information, and information about other agents. We use three variants of a warehouse task to show that a single planner of this type can generate cooperative behavior using task allocation, direct communication, and signaling, as appropriate. This demonstrates that our algorithmic framework can automatically optimize control and communication policies for complex multi-robot systems."
icra,None,When to do your own thing: Analysis of cost uncertainties in multi-robot task allocation at run-time,"Changjoo Nam,Dylan A. Shell,","We address the problem of finding the optimal assignment of tasks to a team of robots when the associated costs may vary, which arises when robots deal with uncertain or dynamic situations. We detail how to compute a sensitivity analysis that characterizes how much costs may change before optimality is violated. Using this analysis, robots are able to avoid unnecessary re-assignment computations and reduce global communication. First, given a model of how costs may evolve, we develop an algorithm to partition the robots into independent cliques, each of which maintains global optimality by communicating only amongst themselves. Second, we propose a method for computing the worst-case sub-optimality if robots persist with the initial assignment, performing no further communication/computation. Lastly, we develop an algorithm that assesses whether cost changes affect the optimality through an escalating succession of local checks. Experiments show that the methods reduce the degree of centralization needed by a multi-robot system."
icra,None,Global connectivity control for spatially interacting multi-robot systems with unicycle kinematics,"Ryan K. Williams,Andrea Gasparri,Gaurav S. Sukhatme,Giovanni Ulivi,","In this paper, we consider the problem of connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems with unicycle kinematics. While previous work has approached this problem through local control techniques, we propose a solution which achieves global connectivity maintenance under nonholonomic constraints. In addition, our formulation only requires intermittent estimation of algebraic connectivity, and accommodates discontinuous spatial interactions among robots. Specifically, we extend a decision-based link maintenance framework to unicycle kinematics and discontinuous potential-based interaction, by exploiting techniques from nonsmooth analysis. Then, we couple this extension with an existing connectivity estimation technique which yields an estimate with tunable precision in finite time, achieving our result. To illustrate the correctness of our methods, we provide a brief simulation result that closes the paper."
icra,None,A distributed multi-robot approach for the detection and tracking of multiple dynamic anomalies,"David Saldaña,Renato Assunção,Mario F. M. Campos,","In many cases, large area disasters could be possibly be prevented if the incipient small-scale anomalies are detected in their early stages. A way to accomplish this would be to have multiple sensors deployed in disaster prone areas to detect anomalies. However, compared to static sensor networks, robotic sensor networks offer advantages such as active sensing, large area coverage and anomaly tracking. This paper addresses the problem of coordinating and controlling multiple robots for the detection of multiple dynamic anomalies in the environment. The main contribution of the work is a combined approach for the effective exploration under uncertainty, the anomaly tracking, and the autonomous on-line allocation of agents. Robots explore the work area maintaining the history of the sensed areas to reduce redundancy and to allow for full-map coverage. When an anomaly is detected, a robot autonomously determines how to either track the anomaly or to continue the exploration of the environment, depending on the size of the anomaly, which is estimated by the length of the perimeter of the enclosing polygon. We show results of our methodology both in simulation and with actual robots which have demonstrated that robots can autonomously and distributively be allocated to track or to explore depending on the behavior of the detected anomalies."
icra,None,Robust model-free formation control with prescribed performance for nonlinear multi-agent systems,"Charalampos P. Bechlioulis,Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos,","In this paper, we consider the formation control problem for multi-agent systems with unknown nonlinearities and disturbances, under an undirected communication protocol. Exploiting the recently developed prescribed performance control methodology, a robust distributed control scheme of minimal complexity is proposed that achieves and maintains arbitrarily fast and accurately the desired formation. No information regarding the agents' dynamic model is employed in the design procedure. Moreover, contrary to the related works on multi-agent systems, the transient and steady state response is fully decoupled by the underlying graph topology, the control gains selection and the agents' model uncertainties. In particular, the achieved performance is a priori and explicitly imposed by certain designer-specified performance functions. Finally, the theoretical findings are clarified and verified by an extensive simulation study."

icra,None,Distributed centroid estimation and motion controllers for collective transport by multi-robot systems,"Golnaz Habibi,Zachary Kingston,William Xie,Mathew Jellins,James McLurkin,","This paper presents four distributed motion controllers to enable a group of robots to collectively transport an object towards a guide robot. These controllers include: rotation around a pivot robot, rotation in-place around an estimated centroid of the object, translation, and a combined motion of rotation and translation in which each manipulating robot follows a trochoid path. Three of these controllers require an estimate of the centroid of the object, to use as the axis of rotation. Assuming the object is surrounded by manipulator robots, we approximate the centroid of the object by measuring the centroid of the manipulating robots. Our algorithms and controllers are fully distributed and robust to changes in network topology, robot population, and sensor error. We tested all of the algorithms in real-world environments with 9 robots, and show that the error of the centroid estimation is low, and that all four controllers produce reliable motion of the object."

Our approach involves a novel extension of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to allow robots to have life-long, cyclic policies so as to provide continual coverage of an environment. Our proposed method can generate near-optimal policies for a team of robots for small environments in real-time (and in larger environments in under a minute). By incorporating additional planning heuristics we are able to plan coordinated patrolling paths for teams of several robots in large environments quickly on commodity hardware."

The proposed framework uses ensembles of randomized decision trees in a hierarchical cascaded architecture to compute consistent object-class inferences of unseen objects. Specifically, the proposed framework computes object-class probabilities at three levels of an image hierarchy (i.e., pixel-, surfel-, and object-levels) using Random Forest classifiers. Next, these probabilities are fused together to compute a cumulative probabilistic output which is used to infer object categories. This fusion results in an improved object categorization performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
icra,None,Decision making under uncertain segmentations,"Joni Pajarinen,Ville Kyrki,","Making decisions based on visual input is challenging because determining how the scene should be split into individual objects is often very difficult. While previous work mainly considers decision making and visual processing as two separate tasks, we argue that the inherent uncertainty in object segmentation requires an integrated approach that chooses the best decision over all possible segmentations. Our approach over-segments the visual input and combines the segments into possible objects to get a probability distribution over object compositions, represented as particles. We introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure that aims to produce exact, independent samples. In experiments, where a 6-DOF robot arm moves object hypotheses captured by an RGB-D visual sensor, our approach of probability distribution based decision making outperforms an approach which utilises the traditional most likely object composition."
icra,None,Automatic bleeding frame detection in the wireless capsule endoscopy images,"Yixuan Yuan,Max Q. -H. Meng,","Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a revolutionary imaging technique that enables direct inspection of the gastrointestinal tract in a non-invasive way. However, viewing the large amounts of images is a very time-consuming and labor intensive task for clinicians. In this paper, we propose an automatic bleeding detection method in the WCE images. We propose a two-stage saliency map extraction method to highlight bleeding regions where the first-stage saliency map is created by means of different color channels mixer and the second-stage saliency map is obtained from the visual contrast in the RGB color space. Followed by an appropriate fusion strategy and threshold, we localize the bleeding areas in the WCE images. Then we extract statistic color features in the corresponding saliency region and non-saliency region respectively and fuse them together to represent the whole WCE images. Finally Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to carry out the experiment on 800 sample WCE images. Experiment result achieves an accuracy of 95.89%, sensitivity of 98.77% and specificity of 93.45%. This inspiring result demonstrates that the proposed method is very effective in detecting bleeding patterns in the WCE images. Our comparison studies with several state-of-the-art bleeding detection methods confirm that the proposed method achieves much better results than those of the alternative techniques."

Our network performs single-stage regression to graspable bounding boxes without using standard sliding window or region proposal techniques. The model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 14 percentage points and runs at 13 frames per second on a GPU. Our network can simultaneously perform classification so that in a single step it recognizes the object and finds a good grasp rectangle. A modification to this model predicts multiple grasps per object by using a locally constrained prediction mechanism. The locally constrained model performs significantly better, especially on objects that can be grasped in a variety of ways."
icra,None,Salient regions detection for indoor robots using RGB-D data,"Lixing Jiang,Artur Koch,Andreas Zell,","The goal of saliency detection is to highlight objects in image data that stand out relative to their surrounding. Therefore, saliency detection aims to capture regions that are perceived as important. The most recent bottom-up approaches for saliency detection measure contrast based on visual features in 2D scenes, ignoring depth value. This work presents an effective method to measure saliency by mapping pixels into foreground and background regions in RGB-D images. Namely, we first segment an image into regions to evaluate the object uniqueness and consistency using graph-based segmentation. Then, we utilize the region color, depth, layout and boundary information to produce robust foreground and background saliency measures. Finally, we combine the two saliency maps based on Gaussian weights. As a result, our approach produces high-quality saliency maps, which may be used for further processing like object detection or recognition. Experimental results on two datasets compare our method with the state of the art and highlight its effectiveness."
icra,None,RGB-D object recognition and pose estimation based on pre-trained convolutional neural network features,"Max Schwarz,Hannes Schulz,Sven Behnke,","Object recognition and pose estimation from RGB-D images are important tasks for manipulation robots which can be learned from examples. Creating and annotating datasets for learning is expensive, however. We address this problem with transfer learning from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are pre-trained for image categorization and provide a rich, semantically meaningful feature set. We incorporate depth information, which the CNN was not trained with, by rendering objects from a canonical perspective and colorizing the depth channel according to distance from the object center. We evaluate our approach on the Washington RGB-D Objects dataset, where we find that the generated feature set naturally separates classes and instances well and retains pose manifolds. We outperform state-of-the-art on a number of subtasks and show that our approach can yield superior results when only little training data is available."
icra,None,A fixed-dimensional 3D shape representation for matching partially observed objects in street scenes,"Dennis Mitzel,Jasper Diesel,Aljosa Osep,Umer Rafi,Bastian Leibe,","In this paper, we present an object-centric, fixed-dimensional 3D shape representation for robust matching of partially observed object shapes, which is an important component for object categorization from 3D data. A main problem when working with RGB-D data from stereo, Kinect, or laser sensors is that the 3D information is typically quite noisy. For that reason, we accumulate shape information over time and register it in a common reference frame. Matching the resulting shapes requires a strategy for dealing with partial observations. We therefore investigate several distance functions and kernels that implement different such strategies and compare their matching performance in quantitative experiments. We show that the resulting representation achieves good results for a large variety of vision tasks, such as multi-class classification, person orientation estimation, and articulated body pose estimation, where robust 3D shape matching is essential."
icra,None,"Simultaneous localization, mapping, and manipulation for unsupervised object discovery","Lu Ma,Mahsa Ghafarianzadeh,David Coleman,Nikolaus Correll,,","We present an unsupervised framework for simultaneous appearance-based object discovery, detection, tracking and reconstruction using RGBD cameras and a robot manipulator. The system performs dense 3D simultaneous localization and mapping concurrently with unsupervised object discovery. Putative objects that are spatially and visually coherent are manipulated by the robot to gain additional motion-cues. The robot uses appearance alone, followed by structure and motion cues, to jointly discover, verify, learn and improve models of objects. Induced motion segmentation reinforces learned models which are represented implicitly as 2D and 3D level sets to capture both shape and appearance. We compare three different approaches for appearance-based object discovery and find that a novel form of spatio-temporal super-pixels gives the highest quality candidate object models in terms of precision and recall. Live experiments with a Baxter robot demonstrate a holistic pipeline capable of automatic discovery, verification, detection, tracking and reconstruction of unknown objects."
icra,None,Grasping surfaces of revolution: Simultaneous pose and shape recovery from two views,"Cody J. Phillips,Matthieu Lecce,Casey Davis,Kostas Daniilidis,","In many scenarios, robots encounter rotationally symmetric objects for which no known 3D model exists. To be able to grasp such objects using existing grasp point computation schemes, an estimate of their 3D-pose and shape is necessary. In this paper, we address the problem of recovering 3D-pose and shape of an unknown surface of revolution from two perspective views of known relative orientation. We propose a new algorithm for simultaneous estimation of pose and shape without making use of any cross-sections or bi-tangent points needed by other approaches. Our algorithm builds upon existing single-view SOR reconstruction approaches and couples the pose estimation and reconstruction process. Pose is optimized to minimize discrepancies between reconstructed shapes from two views. Our method works even in the presence of only one of the two apparent contours of a surface of revolution. We test our algorithm by comparing to ground-truth poses and shapes as well as performing grasping experiments. We introduce a new dataset of rotationally symmetric objects in a variety of poses and backgrounds and with a measured ground-truth pose and shape."
icra,None,A scalable approach for understanding the visual structures of hand grasps,"Minjie Cai,Kris M. Kitani,Yoichi Sato,","Our goal is to automatically recognize hand grasps and to discover the visual structures (relationships) between hand grasps using wearable cameras. Wearable cameras provide a first-person perspective which enables continuous visual hand grasp analysis of everyday activities. In contrast to previous work focused on manual analysis of first-person videos of hand grasps, we propose a fully automatic vision-based approach for grasp analysis. A set of grasp classifiers are trained for discriminating between different grasp types based on large margin visual predictors. Building on the output of these grasp classifiers, visual structures among hand grasps are learned based on an iterative discriminative clustering procedure. We first evaluated our classifiers on a controlled indoor grasp dataset and then validated the analytic power of our approach on real-world data taken from a machinist. The average F1 score of our grasp classifiers achieves over 0.80 for the indoor grasp dataset. Analysis of real-world video shows that it is possible to automatically learn intuitive visual grasp structures that are consistent with expert-designed grasp taxonomies."
icra,None,Active online confidence boosting for efficient object classification,"Dennis Mund,Rudolph Triebel,Daniel Cremers,","We present a novel efficient algorithm for object classification. Our method is based on the active learning framework, in which training and classification are performed in loops, and new ground truth labels are queried from the supervisor in each loop. Our underlying classifier is from the family of boosting methods, but in contrast to earlier methods, our Confidence Boosting particularly focusses on misclassified samples that have a high classification confidence associated. We show that weighting these samples more than others leads to a decrease of overconfidence, for which we give a formal definition. As a result, our classifier is better suited for active learning, leading to steeper learning curves and less required label queries. We show the benefits of our approach on standard data sets from machine learning and robotics."
icra,None,Affordance detection of tool parts from geometric features,"Austin Myers,Ching L. Teo,Cornelia Fermüller,Yiannis Aloimonos,","As robots begin to collaborate with humans in everyday workspaces, they will need to understand the functions of tools and their parts. To cut an apple or hammer a nail, robots need to not just know the tool's name, but they must localize the tool's parts and identify their functions. Intuitively, the geometry of a part is closely related to its possible functions, or its affordances. Therefore, we propose two approaches for learning affordances from local shape and geometry primitives: 1) superpixel based hierarchical matching pursuit (S-HMP); and 2) structured random forests (SRF). Moreover, since a part can be used in many ways, we introduce a large RGB-Depth dataset where tool parts are labeled with multiple affordances and their relative rankings. With ranked affordances, we evaluate the proposed methods on 3 cluttered scenes and over 105 kitchen, workshop and garden tools, using ranked correlation and a weighted F-measure score [26]. Experimental results over sequences containing clutter, occlusions, and viewpoint changes show that the approaches return precise predictions that could be used by a robot. S-HMP achieves high accuracy but at a significant computational cost, while SRF provides slightly less accurate predictions but in real-time. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approaches on the Cornell Grasping Dataset [25] for detecting graspable regions, and achieve state-of-the-art performance."
icra,None,Regrasping and unfolding of garments using predictive thin shell modeling,"Yinxiao Li,Danfei Xu,Yonghao Yue,Yan Wang,Shih-Fu Chang,,,","Deformable objects such as garments are highly unstructured, making them difficult to recognize and manipulate. In this paper, we propose a novel method to teach a two-arm robot to efficiently track the states of a garment from an unknown state to a known state by iterative regrasping. The problem is formulated as a constrained weighted evaluation metric for evaluating the two desired grasping points during regrasping, which can also be used for a convergence criterion The result is then adopted as an estimation to initialize a regrasping, which is then considered as a new state for evaluation. The process stops when the predicted thin shell conclusively agrees with reconstruction. We show experimental results for regrasping a number of different garments including sweater, knitwear, pants, and leggings, etc."
icra,None,Learning the spatial semantics of manipulation actions through preposition grounding,"Konstantinos Zampogiannis,Yezhou Yang,Cornelia Fermüller,Yiannis Aloimonos,","In this paper, we introduce an abstract representation for manipulation actions that is based on the evolution of the spatial relations between involved objects. Object tracking in RGBD streams enables straightforward and intuitive ways to model spatial relations in 3D space. Reasoning in 3D overcomes many of the limitations of similar previous approaches, while providing significant flexibility in the desired level of abstraction. At each frame of a manipulation video, we evaluate a number of spatial predicates for all object pairs and treat the resulting set of sequences (Predicate Vector Sequences, PVS) as an action descriptor. As part of our representation, we introduce a symmetric, time-normalized pairwise distance measure that relies on finding an optimal object correspondence between two actions. We experimentally evaluate the method on the classification of various manipulation actions in video, performed at different speeds and timings and involving different objects. The results demonstrate that the proposed representation is remarkably descriptive of the high-level manipulation semantics."
icra,None,Efficient monocular pose estimation for complex 3D models,"A. Rubio,M. Villamizar,L. Ferraz,A. Penate-Sanchez,A. Ramisa,,,,","We propose a robust and efficient method to estimate the pose of a camera with respect to complex 3D textured models of the environment that can potentially contain more than 100; 000 points. To tackle this problem we follow a top down approach where we combine high-level deep network classifiers with low level geometric approaches to come up with a solution that is fast, robust and accurate. Given an input image, we initially use a pre-trained deep network to compute a rough estimation of the camera pose. This initial estimate constrains the number of 3D model points that can be seen from the camera viewpoint. We then establish 3D-to-2D correspondences between these potentially visible points of the model and the 2D detected image features. Accurate pose estimation is finally obtained from the 2D-to-3D correspondences using a novel PnP algorithm that rejects outliers without the need to use a RANSAC strategy, and which is between 10 and 100 times faster than other methods that use it. Two real experiments dealing with very large and complex 3D models demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."
icra,None,Grasping strategy for moving object using Net-Structure Proximity Sensor and vision sensor,"Yosuke Suzuki,Keisuke Koyama,Aiguo Ming,Makoto Shimojo,","This study presents a robot-hand-arm system with high robustness and responsiveness by using a “Net-Structure Proximity Sensor.” The sensor, which we have developed and specially designed for a robot hand, directly detects an object being to be grasped and outputs analog voltage signals according to the position/posture error between the robot hand and the object. It has been confirmed that the robot hand is able to quickly adjust to and grasp an unknown object by applying a feed-back control method based on the sensor signals. This paper focuses on the integration of the proximity-based feedback control to a commonly-used vision-based control. These sensors work in complementary manner: a vision sensor is available for planning an approaching path of a robot hand by detecting large area, and a Net-Structure Proximity Sensor enables the robot hand to adjust the approaching error before grasping and to improve the certainty of the grasping. Two objective velocities are derived independently by the sensors. By adding the velocities with considering the reliability of the sensor information, the robot hand becomes to be able to perform approaching and adjustment to the target object simultaneously. Experimental results showed that the robot hand grasped a moving object with high success rate even in conditions where it was difficult to predict the trajectory of the object accurately."
icra,None,On quartically-solvable robots,"Nicolás Rojas,Júlia Borràs,Federico Thomas,","This paper presents a first attempt at a unified kinematics analysis of all serial and parallel solvable robots, that is, robots whose position analysis can be carried out without relying on numerical methods. The efforts herein are focused on finding a unified formulation for all quartically-solvable robots, as all other solvable robots can be seen as particular cases of them. The first part is centered on the quest for the most general quartically-solvable parallel and serial robots. As a result, representatives of both classes are selected. Then, using Distance Geometry, it is shown how solving the forward kinematics of the parallel representative is equivalent to solve the inverse kinematics of the serial representative, thus providing a unified formulation. Finally, it is shown that the position and singularity analysis of these robots reduces to the analysis of the relative position of two coplanar ellipses."
icra,None,Dual Quaternion based modal kinematics for multisection continuum arms,"Isuru S. Godage,Ian D. Walker,","This paper presents general modal dual Quaternion (DQ) kinematics for multisection continuum arms. DQ's produce higher accuracy than homogeneous transformation matrices (HTM) when transformed to modal shape functions (MSF) of similar order and are numerically stable. Thus, the model is compact, more accurate and computationally efficient than the modal kinematics proposed by the author based on HTM's. Also, DQ kinematics does not suffer from singularity related limitations of Euler angle based inverse orientation kinematics. Recursive schemes for deriving DQ's and DQ Jacobians are also presented and can be extended arbitrarily. Both modal HTM and modal DQ kinematics are then applied to solve illustrative spatial inverse position and orientation tracking problems. Based on the results, this paper quantitatively compares both methods and highlights the advantages of modal DQ kinematics. The proposed DQ kinematics are easily extensible to variable length multisection continuum arm with general actuator configurations."
icra,None,Prioritized Inverse Kinematics with Multiple Task Definitions,"Sang-ik An,Dongheui Lee,","We are proposing a general framework that incorporates multiple task definitions in the prioritized inverse kinematics problem. First, a mathematical description of multiple task definitions is constructed that provides an efficient way to show unprioritized or prioritized accumulations of tasks. Then, smooth transitions between all task definitions are studied, so a method, called task transition control, is developed that interpolates joint trajectories using barycentric coordinates and linear dynamical systems to overcome difficulties of interpolating task trajectories in the conventional methods. Consequently, smooth, arbitrary, and consecutive task transitions are achieved in a simple, direct, and general manner and also boundedness of joint trajectories is assured regardless of singularity. Lastly, the idea is tested by two kinematic simulations: obstacle avoidance with the KUKA LWR and task scheduling of a humanoid robot."

Porta,Federico Thomas,","Distance Bound Smoothing (DBS) is a basic operation originally developed in Computational Chemistry to determine point configurations that are within certain pairwise ranges of distances. This operation consist in the iterative application of filtering processes that reduce the given ranges using triangular and tetrangular inequalities. Standard DBS has a limited range of applications because it does not take into account constraints on the orientations of simplices (triangles or tetrahedra, depending on the dimension of the problem). This paper discusses an extension of DBS that permits incorporating these constraints. This paves the way for the application of DBS techniques to a broad range of problems in Robotics."
icra,None,IMU-based manipulator kinematic identification,"Nicholas D'Amore,Constance Ciarleglio,David L. Akin,","Reconfigurable robots have the potential for use on a much wider range of tasks than a typical, fixed-configuration robot because they may be modified to accommodate the specific task at hand. Such reconfiguration, however, necessitates the generation of a new kinematics model to allow performance of a task in Cartesian space. Whereas previous work has typically relied on either a known kit of parts from which the robot is constructed or a numerical search technique that is not guaranteed to converge, this paper presents an analytically-based kinematic identification scheme for an all-revolute, serial-link manipulator. Experimental results are presented investigating the practical utility of the technique."
icra,None,Wrapping a target with a tethered projectile,"Lucas Hill,Thomas Woodward,Hitoshi Arisumi,Ross L. Hatton,","A casting manipulator is a robot that launches a payload as a projectile then alters the ballistic trajectory by pulling on an attached tether. Prior work in casting manipulation has focused on applying impulses through the tether to place the payload at a specific location and then retract it. In the spirit of whole-body and whole-arm manipulation, we propose that the tether itself can be used to act on the environment, rather than serving only as a means of directing the projectile. As a first step in this direction, we consider the case of throwing an end-weighted line to wrap a target above and away from the launch point. We explore the necessary conditions for successfully wrapping a target, including the various types of wrapping and the conditions required to make these wraps."

Yang,","Robot calibration is to improve the accuracy of the robot model so as to achieve better positioning accuracy within the robot work cell. Model based calibration approaches are in general limited to compensating for geometric errors and are unable to compensate for error sources that do not fit within the proposed robot model. In order to compensate for the unmodeled error sources, a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network (NN) augmented robot model is proposed together with a two stage calibration process for training the NN. A simulation and an experimental study are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution."
icra,None,Modifying the kinematic structure of an anthropomorphic arm to improve fault tolerance,"K. M. Ben-Gharbia,A. A. Maciejewski,R. G. Roberts,","It is well known that anthropomorphic manipulators, such as the PA-10, are intolerant to a single locked joint failure of the elbow. This is because the elbow is the only joint that can change the distance between the spherical shoulder joint and the spherical wrist. In this work, it is shown how such arms can be made significantly more fault tolerant by a minor modification to the kinematic structure of the arm. We quantify the degree of fault tolerance to locked joint failures as the minimum of the smallest singular value of the resulting seven Jacobians over all possible single failures. The DH parameters for the modified arm are designed so that the corresponding fault tolerant properties are close to those of a robot with an optimally failure tolerant Jacobian. The fault tolerance of the designed robot is evaluated for two different classes of applications, i.e., point-to-point motions and specified end-effector trajectories."
icra,None,Dynamic motion phase segmentation using sEMG during countermovement jump based on hidden semi-Markov model,"Seongsik Park,Il Hong Suh,Wan Kyun Chung,","Dynamic motion of human shows kinematic aspects related to storing elastic energy in skeletal muscle. This results from joint stiffness modulation and as a consequence, countermovement which is opposite to the intended motion is observed. We propose a segmentation algorithm based on a hidden semi-Markov model that infers dynamic motion phases probabilistically from sEMG observations during countermovement jump. In addition, parameter re-estimation of both left-right state transition and restriction of state duration is applied to reduce frequent state transition due to large variation of sEMG observation probability. In experiments, the segmentation of motion phases using sEMG identified the phases of the vertical position of torso successfully and the parameter re-estimation reduced both the error rate and the transition occurrence."
icra,None,Online Bayesian changepoint detection for articulated motion models,"Scott Niekum,Sarah Osentoski,Christopher G. Atkeson,Andrew G.

CHAMP is used in combination with several articulation models to detect changes in articulated motion of objects in the world, allowing a robot to infer physically-grounded task information. We focus on three settings where a changepoint model is appropriate: objects with intrinsic articulation relationships that can change over time, object-object contact that results in quasi-static articulated motion, and assembly tasks where each step changes articulation relationships. We experimentally demonstrate that this system can be used to infer various types of information from demonstration data including causal manipulation models, human-robot grasp correspondences, and skill verification tests."
icra,None,On the monotonicity of optimality criteria during exploration in active SLAM,"Henry Carrillo,Yasir Latif,Maria L. Rodriguez-Arevalo,José Neira,,","In this paper we investigate the monotonicity of various optimality criteria during the exploration phase of an active SLAM algorithm. Optimality criteria such as A-opt, D-opt or E-opt are used in active SLAM to account for uncertainty in the map or the robot's pose, and these criteria are usually part of utility functions which help active SLAM algorithms decide where the robot should move next. The monotonicity of the optimality criteria is of utmost importance. During the exploration phase, i.e. when the robot is traversing new territory or cannot perform a loop closure, the most common way of estimating the pose of the robot is through dead-reckoning. Correctly accounting for the uncertainty is important for an active SLAM algorithm and in particular for a dead-reckoning scenario, where by definition the uncertainty in the robot's pose grows. If monotonicity does not hold in this scenario, active SLAM algorithms can execute actions under the false belief that the uncertainty has reduced. We show analytically and experimentally some conditions in which the A-opt and E-opt criteria lose monotonicity in a dead-reckoning scenario, where the propagation of the robot's pose is done using a linearized framework. We also show analytically and experimentally that under the same conditions the D-opt does not lose monotonicity and, in general for the linearized framework under consideration, D-opt does not break monotonicity."

It was proposed as a benchmark challenge for developing systematic techniques for nonprehensile rolling manipulation. A dynamical model of the underactuated system with a non-unilateral contact is derived. The recently proposed methodologies, known as virtual-holonomic-constraints-based motion planning and transverse-linearization-based orbital stabilization, are appropriately extended to suit the task. Finally, the feasibility is demonstrated through a hardware implementation and an experimental validation of the concept."
icra,None,"An untethered miniature origami robot that self-folds, walks, swims, and degrades","Shuhei Miyashita,Steven Guitron,Marvin Ludersdorfer,Cynthia R. Sung,,","A miniature robotic device that can fold-up on the spot, accomplish tasks, and disappear by degradation into the environment promises a range of medical applications but has so far been a challenge in engineering. This work presents a sheet that can self-fold into a functional 3D robot, actuate immediately for untethered walking and swimming, and subsequently dissolve in liquid. The developed sheet weighs 0.31 g, spans 1.7 cm square in size, features a cubic neodymium magnet, and can be thermally activated to self-fold. Since the robot has asymmetric body balance along the sagittal axis, the robot can walk at a speed of 3.8 body-length/s being remotely controlled by an alternating external magnetic field. We further show that the robot is capable of conducting basic tasks and behaviors, including swimming, delivering/carrying blocks, climbing a slope, and digging. The developed models include an acetone-degradable version, which allows the entire robot's body to vanish in a liquid. We thus experimentally demonstrate the complete life cycle of our robot: self-folding, actuation, and degrading."
icra,None,Human-in-the-loop approach for teaching robot assembly tasks using impedance control interface,"Luka Peternel,Tadej Petrič,Jan Babič,",In this paper we propose a human-in-the-loop approach for teaching robots how to solve part assembly tasks. In the proposed setup the human tutor controls the robot through a haptic interface and a hand-held impedance control interface. The impedance control interface is based on a linear spring-return potentiometer that maps the button position to the robot arm stiffness. This setup allows the tutor to modulate the robot compliance based on the given task requirements. The demonstrated motion and stiffness trajectories are encoded using Dynamical Movement Primitives and learnt using Locally Weight Regression. To validate the proposed approach we performed experiments using Kuka Light Weight Robot and HapticMaster robot. The task of the experiment was to teach the robot how to perform an assembly task involving sliding a bolt fitting inside a groove in order to mount two parts together. Different stiffness was required in different stages of the task execution to accommodate the interaction of the robot with the environment and possible human-robot cooperation.
icra,None,Towards learning hierarchical skills for multi-phase manipulation tasks,"Oliver Kroemer,Christian Daniel,Gerhard Neumann,Herke van Hoof,,","Most manipulation tasks can be decomposed into a sequence of phases, where the robot's actions have different effects in each phase. The robot can perform actions to transition between phases and, thus, alter the effects of its actions, e.g. grasp an object in order to then lift it. The robot can thus reach a phase that affords the desired manipulation. In this paper, we present an approach for exploiting the phase structure of tasks in order to learn manipulation skills more efficiently. Starting with human demonstrations, the robot learns a probabilistic model of the phases and the phase transitions. The robot then employs model-based reinforcement learning to create a library of motor primitives for transitioning between phases. The learned motor primitives generalize to new situations and tasks. Given this library, the robot uses a value function approach to learn a high-level policy for sequencing the motor primitives. The proposed method was successfully evaluated on a real robot performing a bimanual grasping task."
icra,None,Extracting low-dimensional control variables for movement primitives,"Elmar Rueckert,Jan Mundo,Alexandros Paraschos,Jan Peters,Gerhard Neumann,","Movement primitives (MPs) provide a powerful framework for data driven movement generation that has been successfully applied for learning from demonstrations and robot reinforcement learning. In robotics we often want to solve a multitude of different, but related tasks. As the parameters of the primitives are typically high dimensional, a common practice for the generalization of movement primitives to new tasks is to adapt only a small set of control variables, also called meta parameters, of the primitive. Yet, for most MP representations, the encoding of these control variables is pre-coded in the representation and can not be adapted to the considered tasks. In this paper, we want to learn the encoding of task-specific control variables also from data instead of relying on fixed meta-parameter representations. We use hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) to estimate a low dimensional latent variable model for probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs), which is a recent movement primitive representation. We show on two real robot datasets that ProMPs based on HBMs outperform standard ProMPs in terms of generalization and learning from a small amount of data and also allows for an intuitive analysis of the movement. We also extend our HBM by a mixture model, such that we can model different movement types in the same dataset."
icra,None,It's not easy seeing green: Lighting-resistant stereo Visual Teach & Repeat using color-constant images,"Michael Paton,Kirk MacTavish,Chris J. Ostafew,Timothy D. Barfoot,","Stereo Visual Teach & Repeat (VT&R) is a system for long-range, autonomous route following in unstructured 3D environments. As this system relies on a passive sensor to localize, it is highly susceptible to changes in lighting conditions. Recent work in the optics community has provided a method to transform images collected from a three-channel passive sensor into color-constant images that are resistant to changes in outdoor lighting conditions. This paper presents a lighting-resistant VT&R system that uses experimentally trained color-constant images to autonomously navigate difficult outdoor terrain despite changes in lighting. We show through an extensive field trial that our algorithm is capable of autonomously following a 1km outdoor route spanning sandy/rocky terrain, grassland, and wooded areas. Using a single visual map created at midday, the route was autonomously repeated 26 times over a period of four days, from sunrise to sunset with an autonomy rate (by distance) of over 99.9%. These experiments show that a simple image transformation can extend the operation of VT&R from a few hours to multiple days."

We define the ice-relative navigation problem and report a novel underwater robot vehicle, Nereid-UI, and its navigation system designed for under-ice oceanographic operations in ice-covered seas. The goal of Nereid-UI is to enable deployments in polar ocean regions traditionally considered difficult or impossible to access such as the ice-ocean interface in marginal ice zones, the water column of ice-covered seas, and the water column underlying ice shelves. This paper also reports the navigation results of Nereid-UI's first under-ice sea trials and science operations conducted under moving multi-year sea ice off the ice breaker Polarstern in the Arctic Ocean at 83° N 6° W - about 200 km NE of Greenland."
icra,None,Learning multiple collaborative tasks with a mixture of Interaction Primitives,"Marco Ewerton,Gerhard Neumann,Rudolf Lioutikov,Heni Ben Amor,,,","Robots that interact with humans must learn to not only adapt to different human partners but also to new interactions. Such a form of learning can be achieved by demonstrations and imitation. A recently introduced method to learn interactions from demonstrations is the framework of Interaction Primitives. While this framework is limited to represent and generalize a single interaction pattern, in practice, interactions between a human and a robot can consist of many different patterns. To overcome this limitation this paper proposes a Mixture of Interaction Primitives to learn multiple interaction patterns from unlabeled demonstrations. Specifically the proposed method uses Gaussian Mixture Models of Interaction Primitives to model nonlinear correlations between the movements of the different agents. We validate our algorithm with two experiments involving interactive tasks between a human and a lightweight robotic arm. In the first, we compare our proposed method with conventional Interaction Primitives in a toy problem scenario where the robot and the human are not linearly correlated. In the second, we present a proof-of-concept experiment where the robot assists a human in assembling a box."

The method could be used in autonomous or semi-autonomous forest machines during tending operations. Detection is done by segmenting laser range images formed by a rotating laser scanner. Classification is done with a two-class Naive Bayes classifier based on image texture features. Multiple combinations of 99 features were tested and the best classifier included eight features from the co-occurrence matrix, local binary patterns, statistical geometrical features and Gabor filter. 79% of spruces and birches in the testing material were detected and 74% of these were correctly classified. Results suggest that the approach is suitable but there are still some challenges in each of the processing steps. Iteration between segmentation and classification is needed to increase reliability."

In RoboSherlock, perception and interpretation of realistic scenes is formulated as an unstructured information management (UIM) problem. The application of the UIM principle supports the implementation of perception systems that can answer task-relevant queries about objects in a scene, boost object recognition performance by combining the strengths of multiple perception algorithms, support knowledge-enabled reasoning about objects and enable automatic and knowledge-driven generation of processing pipelines. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework by three feasibility studies of systems for real-world scene perception that have been built on top of RoboSherlock."
icra,None,"Robot, organize my shelves! Tidying up objects by predicting user preferences","Nichola Abdo,Cyrill Stachniss,Luciano Spinello,Wolfram Burgard,","As service robots become more and more capable of performing useful tasks for us, there is a growing need to teach robots how we expect them to carry out these tasks. However, learning our preferences is a nontrivial problem, as many of them stem from a variety of factors including personal taste, cultural background, or common sense. Obviously, such factors are hard to formulate or model a priori. In this paper, we present a solution for tidying up objects in containers, e.g., shelves or boxes, by following user preferences. We learn the user preferences using collaborative filtering based on crowdsourced and mined data. First, we predict pairwise object preferences of the user. Then, we subdivide the objects in containers by modeling a spectral clustering problem. Our solution is easy to update, does not require complex modeling, and improves with the amount of user data. We evaluate our approach using crowdsoucing data from over 1,200 users and demonstrate its effectiveness for two tidy-up scenarios. Additionally, we show that a real robot can reliably predict user preferences using our approach."
icra,None,Mobile manufacturing of large structures,"David Bourne,Howie Choset,Humphrey Hu,George Kantor,Chris Niessl,,,,","Assembly of large structures requires large fixtures, often referred to as monuments. Their cost and massive size limit flexibility and scalability of the manufacturing process. Numerous small mobile robots can replace these large structures and, therefore, replicate the efficiency of the assembly line with far more flexibility. An assembly line made up of mobile manipulators can easily and rapidly be reconfigured to support scalability and a varied product mix, while allowing for near optimal resource assignment. The challenge to using small robots in place of monuments is making their joint behavior precise enough to accomplish the task and efficient enough to execute subtasks in a reasonable period of time. In this paper, we describe a set of techniques that we combine to achieve the necessary precision and overall efficiency to build a large structure. We describe and demonstrate these techniques in the context of a testbed we implemented for assembling a wing ladder."
icra,None,A self stabilizing underwater sub-surface inspection robot using hydrodynamic ground effect,"S Bhattacharyya,HH Asada,M.S. Triantafyllou,","In this paper we present a unique self stabilizing ellipsoidal robot for inspection of underwater structures using the principles of ground effect. Underwater metal structures - whether it is ship hulls or internals of a boiling water reactor - require subsurface inspection to detect internal cracks, hidden cavities and other structural damage. This is usually done with on-contact ultrasonic sensors, a slow process if the structure is not sufficiently smooth. However, ultrasound can also be used with a precisely controlled gap. Such precision is challenging relying solely on actuators for control. This paper exploits near surface hydrodynamics to self stabilize a body at a precise gap. Specifically we show how boundary layer and venturi effects combine to create a stable, zero force position at a very small distance from the surface - conceptually similar to air bearings sliders on hard disk drives. Below the stable point lift force dominates, while above it Venturi suction prevails, each bringing the body back to equilibrium. Limitations in the restoring force are considered in the stability analysis included in the paper. This self stabilization method opens a whole new door for non-contact subsurface inspection of underwater structures by autonomous vehicles as well as precision distance maintenance in underwater environment. Here we present our initial analysis and preliminary experimental results for the method when used with an ellipsoidal robot."
icra,None,Design of a locomotion interface for gait simulation based on belt-driven parallel mechanisms,"Dinh-Son Vu,Simon Foucault,Clément Gosselin,Jozsef Kövecses,","This paper presents the design of a locomotion interface for gait simulation and interaction with a virtual environment. The proposed mechanical interface is based on two planar two-degree-of-freedom belt-driven mechanisms which fully decouple the vertical and horizontal motion of two supporting footplates. Force sensors are mounted under the footplates in order to move the end effectors according to the user's intentions. The user's feet are rigidly attached to the footplates but a system of hinges allows an additional unactuated two-degree-of-freedom motion. A lag controller allows the user to move the end-effectors freely and a virtual floor based on a virtual spring and damper restrains the end-effectors' movements so that the user experiences an intuitive contact with the ground. Finally, preliminary experiments are reported in order to demonstrate the capability of the locomotion interface for gait simulation."
icra,None,ℒ1 adaptive control of parallel kinematic manipulators: Design and real-time experiments,"Moussab Bennehar,Ahmed Chemori,Francois Pierrot,","In this paper, the recently developed ℒ 1 adaptive control strategy is experimentally validated for the first time on a parallel kinematic manipulator. The ℒ 1 adaptive controller is known for its decoupled estimation and control loops which enables fast adaptation while guaranteeing robustness of the closed-loop system. The control scheme is experimentally implemented on a 4-DOFs parallel kinematic manipulator. Based on the obtained experimental results, a comparative study shows that the proposed ℒ 1 adaptive controller outperforms the PD controller in terms of tracking performance thanks to the compensation of the nonlinearities in the adaptive controller."
icra,None,The kinematics of cable-driven parallel robots with sagging cables: preliminary results,"Jean-Pierre Merlet,",We consider in this paper cable driven parallel robot (CDPR) with m catenary cables that present a significant deformation due to their elasticity and own mass and we address the kinematics of such a robot under the assumption of static state. We show that the inverse kinematics (IK) requires to solve a square system of equations if the robot has up to 6 cables and an underconstrained system if m > 6. We first show that usual methods for solving the IK of CDPR with other cable model cannot be used and we propose an algorithm that allows one to determine all possible solutions. We then address the forward kinematics (FK) that is known to be usually a difficult task for parallel robots. We show that solving the FK always amounts to solve a square system of equations and that the problem is even more complex than solving the FK of parallel robots with rigid legs as the system is non algebraic and has a larger number of equations. We then propose a generic algorithm for solving the FK for any number of cables. We illustrate the use of the IK and FK solver on a CDPR with 8 cables.
icra,None,Active vibration canceling of a cable-driven parallel robot in modal space,"Xavier Weber,Loic Cuvillon,Jacques Gangloff,","Compared to other parallel robots, cable-driven parallel robots can achieve bigger workspace, higher dynamics with lighter parts and fewer energy while being economically competitive. However, such robots with big workspaces are affected either by cable sagging or by a very low end-effector stiffness, both causing positioning errors. With lightweight cables, the very low stiffness yields disturbing vibrations. In this paper, we address the problem of decoupled active canceling of those vibrations in the modal space. In modal space, vibrations are decomposed in orthogonal signals which allows to use simple SISO control methods to build an active vibration canceling algorithm for the end-effector. As the modal space depends on the end-effector position, better performances are achieved if the controller is tuned for the current robot position. The proposed method is tested both on a realistic simulation and on a 8-cables and 6-degrees of freedom robot."
icra,None,Kinetostatic analysis of the translational RPC-manipulator with different actuator and frame configurations,"I. Prause,M. Lorenz,B. Corves,","Due to excellent dynamic properties and high precision, parallel manipulators are particularly suited for high-speed and high-accuracy object handling. For this reason, the design process of parallel manipulators is usually supposed to optimize the manipulators' dexterity or structural stiffness. Accordingly, this research intends to analyze the effects of changing actuator and frame-configurations regarding the handling performance of a class of translational 3-RPC-manipulators. Since the RPC-structure can be arranged with translational and/or rotational actuators, several different drive configurations are possible. Additionally, four different frame configurations can be identified, expanding the number of possible manipulators. In order to find an optimized actuator and frame configuration for a given task, this research approach systematically reduces the number of possible configurations by means of validity detection and kinetostatic performance analysis. Hence, it is shown that good performance can be achieved for all frame configurations by selecting a suitable actuator combination."
icra,None,A reconfiguration strategy for Reconfigurable Cable-Driven Parallel Robots,"Lorenzo Gagliardini,Stéphane Caro,Marc Gouttefarde,Alexis Girin,","This paper deals with Reconfigurable Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (RCDPRs). A RCDPR is able to change the locations of its cable exit points, the latter being defined as the connection points between the cables and the robot base frame. Given a RCDPR, a set of possible reconfigurations, a desired platform path and a description of the robot environment, the reconfiguration strategy proposed in this paper selects the optimal configurations to be associated to each point of the desired path. The selection of the optimal configurations can be performed with respect to several criteria such as the number of configuration changes, the number of cable reconfigurations and the robot stiffness. In this paper, the optimization is performed using a Dijkstra's based algorithm."
icra,None,Dynamic analysis of a hybrid cable-suspended planar manipulator,"Mahdi Bamdad,Farzin Taheri,Niloofar Abtahi,",This idea introduces a tilting angle amplification system for the cable planar parallel robots. The end-effector rotation capability is increased by adding a serial linkage to the parallel platform. The hybrid serial-parallel robot has the features of both of the parallel manipulator and the serial manipulator. The manipulator is modeled in terms of full dynamics using Newton-Euler and Lagrange methods based analytical approaches.
icra,None,Pulley friction compensation for winch-integrated cable force measurement and verification on a cable-driven parallel robot,"Werner Kraus,Michael Kessler,Andreas Pott,","In a cable-driven parallel robot, elastic cables are used to manipulate the end effector within the workspace. Cable force measurement is necessary for several control algorithms like cable force control, contact control, or load identification. The cable force sensor can be placed directly at the connection point on the platform or somewhere along the cable using pulleys. The pulleys between the force sensor and the platform disturb the force measurement accuracy due to friction. This paper deals with modeling and compensation of the friction. The friction behavior in the drive train with focus on the effects of the pulleys is non-trivial, as the cable movement consists of microscopic and macroscopic movements and standstills. Friction models from Coulomb and Dahl are adapted to deal with the pulley friction. The experimental evaluation showed an improvement of 70% with respect to the uncompensated case."
icra,None,A variational approach to online road and path segmentation with monocular vision,"Lina Maria Paz,Pedro Piniés,Paul Newman,","In this paper we present an online approach to segmenting roads on large scale trajectories using only a monocular camera mounted on a car. We differ from popular 2D segmentation solutions which use single colour images and machine learning algorithms that require supervised training on huge image databases. Instead, we propose a novel approach that fuses 3D geometric data with appearance-based segmentation of 2D information in an automatic system. Our contribution is twofold: first, we propagate labels from frame to frame using depth priors of the segmented road avoiding user interaction most of the time; second, we transfer the segmented road labels to 3D laser point clouds. This reduces the complexity of state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms running on 3D Lidar data. Segmentation fails is in only 3% of the cases over a sequence of 13,600 monocular images spanning an urban trajectory of more than 10km."
icra,None,Probabilistic road context inference for autonomous vehicles,"Wei Liu,Seong-Woo Kim,Marcelo H. Ang,","As autonomous vehicles operating on the urban roads, being conscious of the road context is a crucial prerequisite to safely negotiate with the other vehicles. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to infer the road context from the vehicle behaviors. Specifically, the consistencies of the randomly-observed vehicle states are extracted first, thereafter the road context is inferred in a probabilistic manner by coupling these consistencies. The feasibility of the proposed road context inference approach has been validated by the case study of an urban road that includes roundabout and T-junction. The experiments demonstrate that the inferred road context can be successfully applied for the autonomous vehicles in various aspects."
icra,None,"Enhanced flatbed tow truck model for stable and safe platooning in the presences of lags, communication and sensing delays","Alan Ali,Gaëtan Garcia,Philippe Martinet,","Many ideas have been proposed to reduce traffic congestion. Driving a platoon of vehicles with constant spacing seems to be a promising idea as it increases traffic density. But keeping constant inter-vehicle spacing requires very reliable communication. Another control policy is to drive the platoon with a time headway between vehicles. It is a robust and well known policy but large inter-vehicle distances in addition to weak stability (unity error gain) near low frequencies make it less practical. We have proposed in [1], [2] a modification of the Constant Time Headway policy (CTH). This modification largely reduces the inter-vehicle distances using only one information shared between all vehicles. In this work, we propose an additional modification of our control law. This modification makes our control law similar, in form, to the classical constant spacing policy, but it requires to share only one information between the vehicles. This modification improves the stability of the platoon and removes the weak stability of the CTH near low frequencies. We prove the robustness of the control law in the presence of actuating lags, sensing and communication delays. This proof can also be used to prove the stability of the classical constant spacing policy in the presence of all previous delays, which makes our result more general than those established in the literature. Safety is also discussed and the maximum acceptable communication delay without losing safety is determined. Simulations have been done in many critical scenarios."
icra,None,Improved driver modeling for human-in-the-loop vehicular control,"Katherine Driggs-Campbell,Victor Shia,Ruzena Bajcsy,","In order to develop provably safe human-in-the-loop systems, accurate and precise models of human behavior must be developed. Driving is a good example of such a system because the driver has full control of the vehicle, and her likely actions are highly dependent on her mental state and the context of the current situation. This paper presents a testbed for collecting driver data that allows us to collect realistic data, while maintaining safety and control of the environmental surroundings. We extend previous work that focuses on set predictions consisting of trajectories observed from the nonlinear dynamics and behaviors of the human driven car, accounting for the driver mental state, the context or situation that the vehicle is in, and the surrounding environment in both highway and intersection scenarios. This allows us to predict driving behavior over long time horizons with extremely high accuracy. By using this realistic data and flexible algorithm, a precise and accurate driver model can be developed that is tailored to an individual and usable in semi-autonomous frameworks."
icra,None,AVERT: An autonomous multi-robot system for vehicle extraction and transportation,"Angelos Amanatiadis,Christopher Henschel,Bernd Birkicht,Benjamin Andel,,,,,","This paper presents a multi-robot system for autonomous vehicle extraction and transportation based on the “a-robot-for-a-wheel” concept. The developed prototype is able to extract vehicles from confined spaces with delicate handling, swiftly and in any direction. The novel lifting robots are capable of omnidirectional movement, thus they can under-ride the desired vehicle and dock to its wheels for a synchronized lifting and extraction. The overall developed system applies reasoning about available trajectory paths, wheel identification, local and undercarriage obstacle detection, in order to fully automate the process. The validity and efficiency of the AVERT robotic system is illustrated via experiments in an indoor parking lot, demonstrating successful autonomous navigation, docking, lifting and transportation of a conventional vehicle."
icra,None,"MPDM: Multipolicy decision-making in dynamic, uncertain environments for autonomous driving","Alexander G. Cunningham,Enric Galceran,Ryan M. Eustice,Edwin Olson,","Real-world autonomous driving in city traffic must cope with dynamic environments including other agents with uncertain intentions. This poses a challenging decision-making problem, e.g., deciding when to perform a passing maneuver or how to safely merge into traffic. Previous work in the literature has typically approached the problem using ad-hoc solutions that do not consider the possible future states of other agents, and thus have difficulty scaling to complex traffic scenarios where the actions of participating agents are tightly conditioned on one another. In this paper we present multipolicy decision-making (MPDM), a decision-making algorithm that exploits knowledge from the autonomous driving domain to make decisions online for an autonomous vehicle navigating in traffic. By assuming the controlled vehicle and other traffic participants execute a policy from a set of plausible closed-loop policies at every timestep, the algorithm selects the best available policy for the controlled vehicle to execute. We perform policy election using forward simulation of both the controlled vehicle and other agents, efficiently sampling from the high-likelihood outcomes of their interactions. We then score the resulting outcomes using a user-defined cost function to accommodate different driving preferences, and select the policy with the highest score. We demonstrate the algorithm on a real-world autonomous vehicle performing passing maneuvers and in a simulated merging scenario."
icra,None,Traversable region detection with a learning framework,"Qingquan Zhang,Yong Liu,Yiyi Liao,Yue Wang,","In this paper, we present a novel learning framework for traversable region detection. Firstly, we construct features from the super-pixel level which can reduce the computational cost compared to pixel level. Multi-scale super-pixels are extracted to give consideration to both outline and detail information. Then we classify the multiple-scale super-pixels and merge the labels in pixel level. Meanwhile, we use weighted ELM as our classifier which can deal with the imbalanced class distribution since we only assume that a small region in front of robot is traversable at the beginning of learning. Finally, we employ the online learning process so that our framework can be adaptive to varied scenes. Experimental results on three different style of image sequences, i.e. shadow road, rain sequence and variational sequence, demonstrate the adaptability, stability and parameter insensitivity of our method to the varied scenes and complex illumination."
icra,None,Leveraging experience for large-scale LIDAR localisation in changing cities,"Will Maddern,Geoffrey Pascoe,Paul Newman,","Recent successful approaches to autonomous vehicle localisation and navigation typically involve 3D LIDAR scanners and a static, curated 3D map, both of which are expensive to acquire and maintain. In this paper we propose an experience-based approach to matching a local 3D swathe built using a push-broom 2D LIDAR to a number of prior 3D maps, each of which has been collected during normal driving in different conditions. Local swathes are converted to a combined 2D height and reflectance representation, and we exploit the GPU rendering pipeline to densely sample the localisation cost function to provide robustness and a wide basin of convergence. Prior maps are incrementally built into an experience-based framework from multiple traversals of the same environment, capturing changes in environment structure and appearance over time. The LIDAR localisation solutions from each prior map are fused with vehicle odometry in a probabilistic framework to provide a single pose solution suitable for automated driving. Using this framework we demonstrate real-time centimetre-level localisation using LIDAR data collected in a dynamic city environment over a period of a year."
icra,None,Design and analysis of a novel quadrotor system - VOOPS,"Ganeshram Nandakumar,Thiyagarajan Ranganathan,Arjun B.J.,Asokan Thondiyath,","This paper presents the design and analysis of a quadrotor with a novel configuration, VOOPS-Vertically Offset Overlapped Propulsion System. The objective of this configuration is to increase the payload capacity of a quadrotor without increasing the overall dimension and without compromising endurance. This has been achieved by vertically offsetting the propellers and allowing propeller overlaps so that an increase in propeller size can be achieved without any increase in the overall dimensions. The design details and the dynamic model of the VOOPS configuration are presented. The constraints on the design parameters such as propeller offset and overlap are determined using propeller deflection model and geometry respectively. The effects on change in the design parameters of VOOPS configuration were studied using bench tests and performance simulation of quadrotor with VOOPS configuration were carried out. Practical implementation of VOOPS configuration is also discussed."

A nonlinear dynamic model based on the exponential coordinates parametrization of rotation is proposed. By analysing the model using Lie Group and Lie Algebra theory, cascaded linear PID controllers are designed. To further improve the controller performance, PID controllers are augmented with smith predictor and rotational trajectory planner. The experiments conducted on a real quadrotor show that our control algorithm surpasses most known quadrotor controllers."

Seneviratne,","In this paper, we deal with the stability and tracking control problem of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of the modeling error and disturbance uncertainty. The flight tracking control system combines classical proportional-derivative (PD) like term with robust and adaptive control term. Lyapunov method is used to design and show the asymptotic behavior of the linear and angular states of the vehicle. In contrast with other existing adaptive backstepping design, the proposed design is very simple and easy to implement as it does not require multiple design steps without using augmented signals and known bound of the uncertainty. Various experimental results on quadrotor UAV system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design for real-time application."
icra,None,Attitude of quadrotor-like vehicles: Fuzzy modeling and control with prescribed rate of convergence,"Leonardo Amaral Mozelli,Armando Alves Neto,Mario Fernando Montenegro Campos,","This paper addresses a method for stabilizing the attitude of a quadrotor-like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Towards this end, a new fuzzy control technique based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) is proposed, relying on a simple Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model when compared to others found in the Literature. This strategy guarantees prescribed performance criteria, such as exponential decay rate, allowing stability under aggressive disturbances. The designed local gains are combined through membership functions of the model and are used to regulate the attitude of the vehicle on the hovering operating point, an important flight mode for this kind of robot. Numerical analysis reveal how the transient response can be tuned and tests with disturbances show the stability of the vehicle starting from different initial conditions, illustrating the merits of the proposed approach."
icra,None,Passive stability of vehicles without angular momentum including quadrotors and ornithopters,"Matthew Piccoli,Mark Yim,",The paper presents a model for adding stabilizers to a flying device without rotational momentum (such as quadrotors or ornithopters) that will create passively stable vehicles in hover. This model enables the design of the size and location of these stabilizers that will vary the stability and performance of the vehicle. The model is verified with nine experimental vehicles that span the stability design space. Passive stability allows the removal of costly inertial sensors and increases the robustness of the vehicle. Analysis of the cost and drag that impacts flight performance is also discussed.
icra,None,Automatic re-initialization and failure recovery for aggressive flight with a monocular vision-based quadrotor,"Matthias Faessler,Flavio Fontana,Christian Forster,Davide Scaramuzza,","Autonomous, vision-based quadrotor flight is widely regarded as a challenging perception and control problem since the accuracy of a flight maneuver is strongly influenced by the quality of the on-board state estimate. In addition, any vision-based state estimator can fail due to the lack of visual information in the scene or due to the loss of feature tracking after an aggressive maneuver. When this happens, the robot should automatically re-initialize the state estimate to maintain its autonomy and, thus, guarantee the safety for itself and the environment. In this paper, we present a system that enables a monocular-vision-based quadrotor to automatically recover from any unknown, initial attitude with significant velocity, such as after loss of visual tracking due to an aggressive maneuver. The recovery procedure consists of multiple stages, in which the quadrotor, first, stabilizes its attitude and altitude, then, re-initializes its visual state-estimation pipeline before stabilizing fully autonomously. To experimentally demonstrate the performance of our system, we aggressively throw the quadrotor in the air by hand and have it recover and stabilize all by itself. We chose this example as it simulates conditions similar to failure recovery during aggressive flight. Our system was able to recover successfully in several hundred throws in both indoor and outdoor environments."

Mueller,Michael Hamer,Raffaello D'Andrea,","A state estimator for a quadrocopter is presented, using measurements from an accelerometer, angular rate gyroscope, and a set of ultra-wideband ranging radios. The estimator uses an extended aerodynamic model for the quadrocopter, where the full 3D airspeed is observable through accelerometer measurements. The remaining quadrocopter states, including the yaw orientation, are rendered observable by fusing ultra-wideband range measurements, under the assumption of no wind. The estimator is implemented on a standard microcontroller using readily-available, low-cost sensors. Performance is experimentally investigated in a variety of scenarios, where the quadrocopter is flown under feedback control using the estimator output."
icra,None,Virtual Rigid Bodies for coordinated agile maneuvering of teams of micro aerial vehicles,"Dingjiang Zhou,Mac Schwager,","This paper proposes a method for controlling a team of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles to perform agile maneuvers while holding a fixed relative formation, as well as transitioning between a sequence of formations. The objective is to coordinate the quadrotors to fly in intricate interlaced patterns, similarly to an air show demonstration team. The paper proposes a new abstraction, called a Virtual Rigid Body, which allows the quadrotors to hold relative positions while executing agile maneuvers as a group. By planning trajectories for the Virtual Rigid Body in SE(3), trajectories for each quadrotor are obtained in order to maintain the desired formation during the maneuver. The paper also proposes a method for sequencing a series of Virtual Rigid Body formations, and automatically designing collision free transitions between successive formations, while the team simultaneously executes a trajectory in SE(3). The resulting sequence of formations and transitions gives trajectories that weave intricate designs while avoiding collisions. The method is demonstrated experimentally with three KMel K500 quadrotors flying in a motion capture environment."
icra,None,Closed loop task space control of an interleaved continuum-rigid manipulator,"Benjamin Conrad,Michael Zinn,","A new manipulation approach, referred to as interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation, which combines inherently safe, flexible actuated segments with more precise embedded rigid-link joints has recently been introduced [1], [2]. The redundantly actuated manipulator possesses the safety characteristics inherent in flexible segment devices while gaining some of the performance attributes of rigid-link joint systems. In this paper, we describe a general controller developed for an interleaved manipulator. The controller is implemented on a clinically-relevant prototype, the results of which demonstrate the advantages of an interleaved manipulator. We also consider kinematic drivers of the interleaved manipulator workspace, showing that careful kinematic considerations can substantially improve manipulator workspace and task accuracy."

Elson,George Mylonas,","Colonoscopy is the gold standard screening test for colorectal cancer. However, it can miss up to 22% of lesions. One way to reduce this misrate is by guiding the endoscopist's attention towards suspicious areas (red-flagging). In this paper, we present the proof-of-concept of a novel endoscopic imaging device for the scanning of tubular organs such as the colon and the esophagus. The envisaged concept works as an accessory for any conventional flexible endoscope using it as a rail. It can generate a red-flagged map of the whole organ by orbiting and sliding a radial array of optical sensors around and along the endoscope. This concept paves the way for a semi-automated concurrent red-flagging technique for colonoscopy that enhances the endoscopist's situational awareness and reduces misrate."
icra,None,IRIS: Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake,"Xingchi He,Vincent van Geirt,Peter Gehlbach,Russell Taylor,Iulian Iordachita,","Retinal surgery is one of the most technically challenging surgical disciplines. Many robotic systems have been developed to enhance the surgical capabilities. However, very few of them provide the surgeon the dexterity within the patient's eye to enable more flexible, more advanced surgical procedures. This paper presents a sub-millimeter intraocular dexterous robot, the Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (IRIS). The variable neutral-line mechanism is used to provide very high dexterity with a very small form factor. The IRIS distal dexterous unit is 0.9 mm in diameter and about 3 mm in length. It enables two rotational degrees of freedom at the distal end of the ophthalmic instruments. The analysis on contact mechanics provides a reference for the adjustment of the wire pretension. Redundant actuation is implemented by using one motor for each wire. A motion scaling transmission is developed to overcome the suboptimal resolution of the motors. A scale-up model of the IRIS is built for initial experimental evaluation. Preliminary results show that the scale-up IRIS can provide large range of motion. For given bending angle, the kinematic model can estimate the desired wire translation when the friction is not significant. The first prototype of the actual-scale IRIS is assembled and tested."
icra,None,FBG-based polymer-molded shape sensor integrated with minimally invasive surgical robots,"Hyowon Moon,Jinwoo Jeong,Ockchul Kim,Keri Kim,Woosub Lee,,,","Shape tracking using a fiber Bragg grating sensor is a promising tool due to its thin, flexible, and weightless nature. Conventional investigations attached optical fibers with a metal rod which limited the curvature due to its stiffness and increased distance between the center of the fiber and that of the sensor. We fabricated ultrathin flexible shape sensor with 110 mm length and 560 μm diameter. Its low Young's modulus and small diameter makes it suitable for application in minimally invasive surgical robot such as active cannula. The sensor causes only miniscule resistance when the cannula rotates or moves, and allows extra spaces for other surgical tools thanks to its small diameter. After the calibration, the sensor was integrated to the active cannula and overall position of the sensor was tracked. It showed an average error of 3.17 ± 1.21 % of the lengths of the measured nodes from the fixed starting point. The error was comparable to the outer diameter of the cannula, 2.8mm."

We present a needle-sized wrist design that grants this ability. It can be easily interfaced with manual tools or concentric tube robots and is straightforward and inexpensive to manufacture. The wrist consists of a nitinol tube with several asymmetric cutouts, actuated by a tendon. Perhaps counter-intuitively, within this seemingly simple design concept, design optimization is challenging due to the number of parameters available and nonlinearities in material properties. In this paper, we examine a subset of possible geometries and derive kinematic and static models. Experimental results with a 1.16 mm diameter prototype validate the models. Lastly, we provide a discussion summarizing the lessons learned in our early experience designing and fabricating wrists of this type."
icra,None,Simplified adaptive path planning for percutaneous needle insertions,"Éderson Dorileo,Abdulrahman Albakri,Nabil Zemiti,Philippe Poignet,","Needle placement errors can mitigate the effectiveness of the diagnosis or the therapy, sometimes with catastrophic outcomes.

We present in this work, the validation results for the needle deflection prediction model. Its robustness is evaluated under an unknown context such as a different robotic platform, facing uncertainties conditions not conceived previously in the model's confection. In addition, the work presents the development and validation experiments of an adaptive path planner that uses the model as predictor's strategy. It provides pre-operative planning assistance, as well as intra-operative decision-making support. The experiments results showed average error around 1mm for the pre-operative planning and the intra-operative replanning approach showed to be very robust to correct the initial predictions, showing average error smaller than 1 mm."
icra,None,Towards automated surgical skill evaluation of endovascular catheterization tasks based on force and motion signatures,"Hedyeh Rafii-Tari,Christopher J. Payne,Jindong Liu,Celia Riga,,,","Despite the increased use of robotic catheter navigation systems, and the growing interest in surgical skill evaluation in the field of endovascular intervention, there is a lack of objective and quantitative metrics for performance evaluation. So far very little research has studied operator behavioral patterns using catheter kinematics, operator forces and motions, and catheter-tissue interactions. This paper proposes a framework for automated and objective assessment of performance by measuring catheter-tissue contact forces and operator motion patterns across different skill levels, and using language models to learn the underlying force and motion patterns that are characteristic of skill. Discrete HMMs are utilized to model operator behavior for varying skill levels performing different catheterization tasks, resulting in cross-validation classification accuracies of 94% (expert) and 98% (novice) using the force-based skill models, as well as 83% (expert) and 94% (novice) using the motion-based models. The results motivate the design of improved metrics for endovascular skill assessment with further applications towards performance evaluation of robot-assisted endovascular catheterization."

Our contribution in this context is a non-linear observability analysis of the target tracking network, which yields insights into the topological and actuation conditions necessary for the underlying state estimation problem. We demonstrate a metric of observability which allows us to determine robot inputs that maximize observability to improve team localization. Combining the observability metric with topological control then yields a robust target tracking solution. We close the paper with a simulation example which demonstrates the ability of our solution to cope with scenarios in which relative measurements poorly distinguish the target."
icra,None,Wisdom of the swarm for cooperative decision-making in human-swarm interaction,"J. Nagi,H. Ngo,L. M. Gambardella,Gianni A. Di Caro,","Human-swarm interaction (HSI) is a developing field of research in which the problem of gesture-based control has been attracting an increasing attention, being at the same time a natural form of interaction and an effective way to point and select individual or groups of robots in the swarm. Gesture-based interaction usually requires vision-based recognition and classification of the gesture from the swarm. At this aim, existing methods for cooperative sensing and recognition make use of distributed consensus algorithms, which include for instance averaging and frequency counting. In this work we present a distributed consensus protocol that allows robot swarms to learn efficiently gestures from online interactions with a human teacher. The protocol also facilitates the integration of different consensus algorithms. Experiments have been performed in emulation using on real data acquired by a swarm of robots. The results indicate that effectively exploiting the collective decision-making of the swarm is a viable way to rapidly achieve good learning performance."

Our approach is based on a distributed triangulation of the work space, in which a set of p stationary sensors provides coverage control; in addition, there are r mobile robots that can move between the sensors. Building on our prior work on structured exploration of unknown spaces with multi-robot systems, we can make use of a triangulation that is constructed in a distributed fashion and guarantees good local navigation properties, even when sensors and robots have very limited capabilities."
icra,None,Efficient leader selection for translation and scale of a bearing-compass formation,"Eric Schoof,Airlie Chapman,Mehran Mesbahi,","The paper considers the efficient selection of leader agents in a swarm running a distributed bearing-compass formation controller. The leaders apply external control which induces translation and scaling of the formation, providing manipulation methods useful to a human operator. The selection algorithm for maximizing translation and scale draws from modularity and submodularity theory. Consequently, the algorithms exhibit guaranteed optimal and suboptimal performance, respectively. For more restricted human-swarm interaction requiring pure translation and scale, a relaxed integer programming algorithm is described to reduce the combinatorial optimization problem to a computationally tractable semidefinite program. The leader selection strategies are supported through demonstration on a swarm testbed."

We model the population dynamics of the robotic swarm as a set of advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equations (PDEs), a linear parabolic PDE model that is bilinear in the robots' velocity and task-switching rates. These parameters constitute a set of time-dependent control variables that can be optimized and broadcast to the robots prior to their deployment. The planning and allocation problem can then be formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, which we solve using techniques from optimal control. Simulations of a commercial pollination scenario validate the ability of our control approach to drive a robotic swarm to achieve predefined spatial distributions of activity over a closed domain, which may contain obstacles."

Pascoal,Alcherio Martinoli,","Robotic odor source localization is a promising tool with numerous applications in safety, search and rescue, and environmental science. In this paper, we present an algorithm for odor source localization using multiple cooperating robots equipped with chemical sensors. Laplacian feedback is employed to maintain the robots in a formation, introducing spatial diversity that is used to better establish the position of the flock relative to the plume and its source. Robots primarily move upwind but use odor information to adjust their position and spacing so that they are centered on the plume and trace its structure. Real-world experiments were performed with an ethanol plume inside a wind tunnel, and used to both validate the algorithm and assess the impact of different formation shapes."
icra,None,A novel bridge section model endowed with actively controlled flap arrays mitigating wind impact,"Maria Boberg,Glauco Feltrin,Alcherio Martinoli,","In this work, we present the SmartBridge, a novel bridge section model equipped with actively controlled arrays of flaps aiming at mitigating wind-induced vibrations of long-span bridges. The active model, as well as its support structure, is described in detail and the key design choices are motivated. Finally, the capabilities of the system and the active control of the bridge section model with moving flaps was validated by wind tunnel experiments. In spite of the relative simplicity of a, manually tuned, control law, the results are encouraging and show a significant damping of the pitch vibration of the deck."
icra,None,Bio-inspired non-cooperative multi-robot herding,"Alyssa Pierson,Mac Schwager,","This paper presents a new control strategy to control a group of dog-like robots to drive a herd of non-cooperative sheep-like agents to a goal region in the environment. The sheep-like agents, which may be biological or robotic, respond to the presence of the dog-like robots with a repelling potential field common in biological models of the behavior of herding animals. Our key insight in designing control laws for the dog-like robots is to enforce geometrical relationships that allow for the combined dynamics of the dogs and sheep to be mapped to a simple unicycle robot model. We prove convergence of a single sheep to a desired goal region using two or more dogs, and we propose a control strategy for the case of any number of sheep driven by two or more dogs. Simulations in Matlab and hardware experiments with Pololu m3pi robots demonstrate the effectiveness of our control strategy."
icra,None,Sensor fusion for semantic segmentation of urban scenes,"Richard Zhang,Stefan A. Candra,Kai Vetter,Avideh Zakhor,","Semantic understanding of environments is an important problem in robotics in general and intelligent autonomous systems in particular. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation algorithm which effectively fuses information from images and 3D point clouds. The proposed method incorporates information from multiple scales in an intuitive and effective manner. A late-fusion architecture is proposed to maximally leverage the training data in each modality. Finally, a pairwise Conditional Random Field (CRF) is used as a post-processing step to enforce spatial consistency in the structured prediction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the publicly available KITTI dataset [1] [2], augmented with additional pixel and point-wise semantic labels for building, sky, road, vegetation, sidewalk, car, pedestrian, cyclist, sign/pole, and fence regions. A per-pixel accuracy of 89.3% and average class accuracy of 65.4% is achieved, well above current state-of-the-art [3]."
icra,None,3D object pose detection using foreground/background segmentation,"Antoine Petit,Eric Marchand,Rafiq Sekkal,Keyvan Kanani,","This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and localizing a poorly textured known object, by initially estimating its complete 3D pose in a video sequence. Our solution relies on the 3D model of the object and synthetic views. The full pose estimation process is then based on foreground/background segmentation and on an efficient probabilistic edge-based matching and alignment procedure with the set of synthetic views, classified through an unsupervised learning phase. Our study focuses on space robotics applications and the method has been tested on both synthetic and real images, showing its efficiency and convenience, with reasonable computational costs."
icra,None,Saliency-based object discovery on RGB-D data with a late-fusion approach,"Germán M. García,Ekaterina Potapova,Thomas Werner,Michael Zillich,,,","We present a novel method based on saliency and segmentation to generate generic object candidates from RGB-D data. Our method uses saliency as a cue to roughly estimate the location and extent of the objects present in the scene. Salient regions are used to glue together the segments obtained from over-segmenting the scene by either color or depth segmentation algorithms, or by a combination of both. We suggest a late-fusion approach that first extracts segments from color and depth independently before fusing them to exploit that the data is complementary. Furthermore, we investigate several mechanisms for ranking the object candidates. We evaluate on one publicly available dataset and on one challenging sequence with a high degree of clutter. The results show that we are able to retrieve most objects in real-world indoor scenes and clearly outperform other state-of-the art methods."
icra,None,"Semantic octree: Unifying recognition, reconstruction and representation via an octree constrained higher order MRF","Sunando Sengupta,Paul Sturgess,","On the one hand, mainly within the computer vision community, multi-resolution image labelling problems with pixel, super-pixel and object levels, have made great progress towards the modelling of holistic scene understanding. On the other hand, mainly within the robotics and graphics communities, multi-resolution 3 D representations of the world have matured to be efficient and accurate. In this paper we bring together the two hands and move towards the new direction of unified recognition, reconstruction and representation. We tackle the problem by embedding an octree into a hierarchical robust P N Markov Random Field. This allows us to jointly infer the multi-resolution 3 D volume along with the object-class labels, all within the constraints of an octree data-structure. The octree representation is chosen as this data-structure is efficient for further processing such as dynamic updates, data compression, and surface reconstruction. We perform experiments in inferring our semantic octree on the The kitti Vision Benchmark Suite in order to demonstrate its efficacy."
icra,None,Object classification using dictionary learning and RGB-D covariance descriptors,"William J. Beksi,Nikolaos Papanikolopoulos,","In this paper, we introduce a dictionary learning framework using RGB-D covariance descriptors on point cloud data for performing object classification. Dictionary learning in combination with RGB-D covariance descriptors provides a compact and flexible description of point cloud data. Furthermore, the proposed framework is ideal for updating and sharing dictionaries among robots in a decentralized or cloud network. This work demonstrates the increased performance of 3D object classification utilizing covariance descriptors and dictionary learning over previous results with experiments performed on a publicly available RGB-D database."
icra,None,Discovery of topical object in image collections,"Huaping Liu,Yunhui Liu,Liming Huang,Fuchun Sun,Di Guo,","Automatic discovery of topical objects from a set of image collections provides more strong cognitive capability of robot to understand the unstructured environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on dictionary learning for such a task. Different from existing work which utilizes multiple segmentations to coarsely obtain the object regions, we adopt the most recently developed objectness operator to extract candidate objects. Such a method admits a great advantage that the interested objects can be more reliably segmented. A dictionary learning method is proposed to discover the topical objects. Such an optimization model exploits the observation that any image only includes a few topical objects and therefore sparsity is encouraged. Further, a globally convergent algorithm is developed to solve the dictionary learning problem and extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts."
icra,None,LOIND: An illumination and scale invariant RGB-D descriptor,"Guanghua Feng,Yong Liu,Yiyi Liao,","We introduce a novel RGB-D descriptor called local ordinal intensity and normal descriptor (LOIND) with the integration of texture information in RGB image and geometric information in depth image. We implement the descriptor with a 3-D histogram supported by orders of intensities and angles between normal vectors, in addition with the spatial sub-divisions. The former ordering information which is invariant under the transformation of illumination, scale and rotation provides the robustness of our descriptor, while the latter spatial distribution provides higher information capacity so that the discriminative performance is promoted. Comparable experiments with the state-of-art descriptors, e.g. SIFT, SURF, CSHOT and BRAND, show the effectiveness of our LOIND to the complex illumination changes and scale transformation. We also provide a new method to estimate the dominant orientation with only the geometric information, which can ensure the rotation invariance under extremely poor illumination."
icra,None,Real-time image de-blurring and image processing for a robotic vision system,"Michael D. Kim,Jun Ueda,","This paper proposes a method for real-time de-blurring of images captured by a robotic system. De-blurring is achieved by combining a dynamics-based approach and parallel computing. Existing methods have successfully restored a blurry image but were not suitable for real-time applications. The dynamics-based method with parallel programming in the FPGA is used to estimate the PSF during the camera exposure window. The deconvolution process, which involves iterative matrix calculations with millions of pixels, is then performed on the GPU to achieve real-time performance. The proposed method has been evaluated by using a robotic system which has a total of 32 piezoelectric actuators and one vision sensor. The frame rate of image de-blurring ranges from 20.32 to 40.68 fps and thus real-time performance is achieved. In comparison to existing methods, the proposed method produces the best image quality. The dynamics-based approach is extended to real-time image stitching which is computationally cheap and robust to motion blur. It is demonstrated from image stitching that real-time de-blurring is beneficial for image processing."
icra,None,Online motion planning for failure recovery of modular robotic systems,"Vojtěch Vonásek,Sergej Neumann,David Oertel,Heinz Wörn,","Modular robots are built of many basic robotic modules that can be connected into robots of various shapes. These robots are able to recover from a failure by ejecting and replacing damaged modules. Although this type of failure recovery is usually suggested in literature, it may be precluded due inability of the broken modules to cooperate or if no spare modules are available. In such a case, locomotion of a damaged robot should be adapted to allow the robot to reach a repair station or even to finish its task without the need to exchange the broken modules. In this paper, we investigate how to adapt motions of modular robots with respect to failures using the concept of motion planning with motion primitives. The ability of the proposed system to recover from failures is verified in a simulation and also in a HW experiment."
icra,None,On embeddability of modular robot designs,"Yannis Mantzouratos,Tarik Tosun,Sanjeev Khanna,Mark Yim,","We address the problem of detecting embeddability of modular robots: namely, to decide automatically whether a given modular robot design can simulate the functionality of a seemingly different design. To that end, we introduce a novel graph representation for modular robots and formalize the notion of embedding through topological and kinematic conditions. Based on that, we develop an algorithm that decides embeddability when the two involved designs have tree topologies. Our algorithm performs two passes and involves dynamic programming and maximum cardinality matching. We demonstrate our approach on real modular robots and show that we can detect embeddability of complex designs efficiently."
icra,None,Real-time distributed configuration discovery of modular self-reconfigurable robots,"José Baca,Bradley Woosley,Prithviraj Dasgupta,Carl Nelson,","We consider the problem of discovering and representing the topology of a modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSR) in which modules do not have a priori information about other modules that belong to the same configuration. We propose a solution that combines two main features of modules - their geometric shape and their inter-connection with other modules, represented as a connectivity graph. We describe a distributed algorithm that can be used by each module to construct the connectivity graph by discovering other modules in four steps - sharing IDs, creating a local configuration structure (LCS) or list of local neighbors, sharing a matrix with LCSs to adjacent modules, and building an adjacency matrix by combining LCSs. Data is exchanged between modules using infra-red (IR) communication. Our proposed technique can operate within limited computational resources available on a module and is robust to module failures. We have tested and demonstrated the successful operation of our proposed technique on the ModRED (Modular Robot for Exploration and Discovery) platform and shown that modules are able to discover both linear and branched configurations using our algorithm."
icra,None,3D M-Blocks: Self-reconfiguring robots capable of locomotion via pivoting in three dimensions,"John W. Romanishin,Kyle Gilpin,Sebastian Claici,Daniela Rus,","This paper presents the mechanical design of a modular robot called the 3D M-Block, a 50mm cubic module capable of both independent and lattice-based locomotion. The first M-Blocks described in [1] could pivot about one axis of rotation only. In contrast, the 3D M-blocks can exert on demand both forward and backward torques about three orthogonal axes, for a total of six directions. The 3D M-Blocks transform these torques into pivoting motions which allow the new 3D M-Blocks to move more freely than their predecessors. Individual modules can employ pivoting motions to independently roll across a wide variety of surfaces as well as to join and move relative to other M-Blocks as part of a larger collective structure. The 3D M-Block maintains the same form factor and magnetic bonding system as the one-dimensional M-Blocks [1], but a new fabrication process supports more efficient and precise production. The 3D M-blocks provide a robust and capable modular self-reconfigurable robotic platform able to support swarm robot applications through individual module capabilities and self-reconfiguring robot applications using connected lattices of modules."
icra,None,Reconfiguration planning for pivoting cube modular robots,"Cynthia Sung,James Bern,John Romanishin,Daniela Rus,","In this paper, we present algorithms for self-reconfiguration of modular robots that move by pivoting. The modules are cubes that can pivot about their edges along the x̂, ŷ, or ẑ axes to move on a 3-dimensional substrate. This is a different model from prior work, which usually considers modules that slide along their faces. We analyze the pivoting cube model and give sufficient conditions for reconfiguration to be feasible. In particular, we show that if an initial configuration does not contain any of three subconfigurations, which we call rules, then it can reconfigure into a line. We provide provably correct algorithms for reconfiguration for both 2-D and 3-D systems, and we verify our algorithms via simulation on randomly generated 2-D and 3-D configurations."
icra,None,Lily: A miniature floating robotic platform for programmable stochastic self-assembly,"Bahar Haghighat,Emmanuel Droz,Alcherio Martinoli,","Fluid-mediated programmable stochastic self-assembly offers promising means to formation of target structures capable of a variety of functionalities. While miniaturized building blocks allow for finer resolutions in such structures, as well as access to unconventional environments, they can only be endowed with very limited on-board resources. In this paper we present the design, fabrication, and experimental results validating the key functionalities of the Lily robot as the building block in a programmable stochastic fluidic self-assembly system, capable of forming 2D structures. In particular, we aim at driving a system including an arbitrary number of Lilies to form target structures through parallel self-assembly, using exclusively local information and communication. While capable of wireless communication to a base station, Lilies are endowed with custom-designed electropermanent magnets to latch and also to communicate locally with their neighbors. Several experiments validate the reliability of the radio channel as well as the robustness of the local induction-based communication which allows for data transfer at 9600 bps with a success rate of 92.8% without repetition. The latches are shown to hold four times the weight of a single robot and to drag in another Lily from a distance of 4 mm in water."
icra,None,An alligator inspired modular robot,"X. Jia,M. Frenger,Z. Chen,W. R. Hamel,M. Zhang,","Due to challenges, such as information collection in huge water, propulsion at different scales and manipulation in extreme fluid environments, wide application of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is limited. In this paper, an alligator modular robot, composed by 14 small robots, was inspired from the locomotion and morphologies of alligators and microorganisms. With the undulatory body and beating legs, the assembled large robot was able to maintain fast and maneuverable swimming for tasks executions at large Reynolds number. With a biologically optimized body aspect ratio (3.47), small modular robots achieved effective propulsion in viscous fluid. Facilitated by a dissembling system, small robots were automatically released from the large robot frame and swam around with independent actuation systems. Hydrodynamic model for the large and small robot were formulated, based on which the propulsion for the modular robot in large and low Reynolds numbers (Res) were simulated. Experiments were conducted to compare with the simulation results to further validate the proposed modular robot design."

Inspired by these natural systems, we present an autonomous tread-based robot which is capable of using its own body as a building block for assembling structures. We analytically assess the optimality of the robot design, and experimentally test its ability to climb over like robots under varying conditions. Finally, using a simple self-assembly algorithm relying on only local sensing, robot prototypes are used to demonstrate the self-assembly of a 2D pyramid structure."

Different from existing context-specific intention awareness (CSIA) approaches which are based on a limited and passive knowledge database, our approach, named `WebIA', adopts a novel web query approach to establish a vast and active knowledge database for robots to perform CSIA. In our method, robots are endowed with comprehensive commonsense knowledge towards the correlations of the surrounding environment and human intentions. WebIA enables robots to effectively infer intentions in both trained familiar and untrained new situations. By performing several experiments, we evaluated two aspects of the WebIA approach: the effectiveness of IA in familiar situations and the self-learning ability in new situations."
icra,None,The design and evaluation of a cooperative handheld robot,"Austin Gregg-Smith,Walterio W. Mayol-Cuevas,","This paper concerns itself with a relatively unexplored type of personal robot that operates in the tool space. Handheld robots aim to cooperate with the user to solve tasks and improve what tools can offer enhanced by actuation, sensing, and importantly, task knowledge. To this end, we devised a new lightweight robotic platform that has 4 DoF and uses a cable driven continuum structure. Feedback from the robot to the user is provided in an intuitive, implicit manner by the robot end effector pointing towards the goal, avoiding pointing, and/or refusing to perform an action when it conflicts with the task specification. We evaluate two generic tasks involving aiming in space and picking/placing objects with a number of volunteers. Repeated measures ANOVA is used to analyse results to show in which conditions an increased level of automation in the handheld robot improves task performance or user perception of task load. The robot is offered as an open robotics platform[1] and the results indicate directions to improve on feedback and interaction mechanisms."
icra,None,Grounding spatial relations for outdoor robot navigation,"Abdeslam Boularias,Felix Duvallet,Jean Oh,Anthony Stentz,","We propose a language-driven navigation approach for commanding mobile robots in outdoor environments. We consider unknown environments that contain previously unseen objects. The proposed approach aims at making interactions in human-robot teams natural. Robots receive from human teammates commands in natural language, such as “Navigate around the building to the car left of the fire hydrant and near the tree”. A robot needs first to classify its surrounding objects into categories, using images obtained from its sensors. The result of this classification is a map of the environment, where each object is given a list of semantic labels, such as “tree” and “car”, with varying degrees of confidence. Then, the robot needs to ground the nouns in the command. Grounding, the main focus of this paper, is mapping each noun in the command into a physical object in the environment. We use a probabilistic model for interpreting the spatial relations, such as “left of” and “near”. The model is learned from examples provided by humans. For each noun in the command, a distribution on the objects in the environment is computed by combining spatial constraints with a prior given as the semantic classifier's confidence values. The robot needs also to ground the navigation mode specified in the command, such as “navigate quickly” and “navigate covertly”, as a cost map. The cost map is also learned from examples, using Inverse Optimal Control (IOC). The cost map and the grounded goal are used to generate a path for the robot. This approach is evaluated on a robot in a real-world environment. Our experiments clearly show that the proposed approach is efficient for commanding outdoor robots."
icra,None,Open-EASE,"Michael Beetz,Moritz Tenorth,Jan Winkler,","Making future autonomous robots capable of accomplishing human-scale manipulation tasks requires us to equip them with knowledge and reasoning mechanisms. We propose Open-EASE, a remote knowledge representation and processing service that aims at facilitating these capabilities. Open-EASE gives its users unprecedented access to the knowledge of leading-edge autonomous robotic agents. It also provides the representational infrastructure to make inhomogeneous experience data from robots and human manipulation episodes semantically accessible, and is complemented by a suite of software tools that enable researchers and robots to interpret, analyze, visualize, and learn from the experience data. Using Open-EASE users can retrieve the memorized experiences of manipulation episodes and ask queries regarding to what the robot saw, reasoned, and did as well as how the robot did it, why, and what effects it caused."
icra,None,Adaptive human-centered representation for activity recognition of multiple individuals from 3D point cloud sequences,"Hao Zhang,Christopher Reardon,Chi Zhang,Lynne E. Parker,","Activity recognition of multi-individuals (ARMI) within a group, which is essential to practical human-centered robotics applications such as childhood education, is a particularly challenging and previously not well studied problem. We present a novel adaptive human-centered (AdHuC) representation based on local spatio-temporal features (LST) to address ARMI in a sequence of 3D point clouds. Our human-centered detector constructs affiliation regions to associate LST features with humans by mining depth data and using a cascade of rejectors to localize humans in 3D space. Then, features are detected within each affiliation region, which avoids extracting irrelevant features from dynamic background clutter and addresses moving cameras on mobile robots. Our feature descriptor is able to adapt its support region to linear perspective view variations and encode multi-channel information (i.e., color and depth) to construct the final representation. Empirical studies validate that the AdHuC representation obtains promising performance on ARMI using a Meka humanoid robot to play multi-people Simon Says games. Experiments on benchmark datasets further demonstrate that our adaptive human-centered representation outperforms previous approaches for activity recognition from color-depth data."
icra,None,Efficiency of speech and iconic gesture integration for robotic and human communicators - a direct comparison,"Paul Bremner,Ute Leonards,","Co-verbal gestures are an important part of human communication, improving its efficiency for information conveyance. A key component of such improvement is the observer's ability to integrate information from the two communication channels, speech and gesture. Whether such integration also occurs when the multi-modal communication information is produced by a humanoid robot, and whether it is as efficient as for a human communicator, is an open question. Here, we present an experiment which, using a fully within subjects design, shows that for a range of iconic gestures, speech and gesture integration occurs with similar efficiency for human and for robot communicators. The gestures for this study were produced on an Aldebaran Robotics NAO robot platform with a Kinect based tele-operation system. We also show that our system is able to produce a range of iconic gestures that are understood by participants in unimodal (gesture only) communication, as well as being efficiently integrated with speech. Hence, we demonstrate the utility of iconic gestures for robotic communicators."
icra,None,Integrating hybrid diagnostic reasoning in plan execution monitoring for cognitive factories with multiple robots,"Esra Erdem,Volkan Patoglu,Zeynep G. Saribatur,","For reliable and fault tolerant operation of cognitive factories, we introduce an algorithm to monitor plan executions. According to this algorithm, when some changes or discrepancies are detected, appropriate decisions are given based on the causes of these changes or discrepancies. To identify these causes (e.g., broken robots or robot components), we introduce a novel diagnostic reasoning method which synergistically integrates hypothetical reasoning, geometric reasoning, and learning from earlier experiences. Based on these causes, if necessary, new hybrid plans (task plans integrated with feasibility checks) are computed to reach the manufacturing goals by allowing repairs of robots/components. The results of our experiments over reasonably-sized cognitive factory scenarios show the usefulness of (i) diagnostic reasoning for execution monitoring, (ii) allowing repair actions during replanning, and (iii) learning from experiences. We provide a video of dynamic simulation of our execution monitoring algorithm with Kuka youBots and a Nao humanoid robot as the supplementary material."
icra,None,Robot Programming by Demonstration with situated spatial language understanding,"Maxwell Forbes,Rajesh P. N. Rao,Luke Zettlemoyer,Maya Cakmak,","Robot Programming by Demonstration (PbD) allows users to program a robot by demonstrating the desired behavior. Providing these demonstrations typically involves moving the robot through a sequence of states, often by physically manipulating it. This requires users to be co-located with the robot and have the physical ability to manipulate it. In this paper, we present a natural language based interface for PbD that removes these requirements and enables hands-free programming. We focus on programming object manipulation actions-our key insight is that such actions can be decomposed into known types of manipulator movements that are naturally described using spatial language; e.g., object reference expressions and prepositions. Our method takes a natural language command and the current world state to infer the intended movement command and its parametrization. We implement this method on a two-armed mobile manipulator and demonstrate the different types of manipulation actions that can be programmed with it. We compare it to a kinesthetic PbD interface and we demonstrate our method's ability to deal with incomplete language."
icra,None,Trajectory generation for immediate path-accurate jerk-limited stopping of industrial robots,"Friedrich Lange,Michael Suppa,","Stopping the motion of industrial robots in response to warnings or unexpected sensor data is a special case of trajectory generation. In contrast to emergency stops, here the robot has to satisfy the limits of the acceleration and the jerk. In addition, during the deceleration the robot must follow the path accurately, i.e., the shape of the original path may not be left. This is usually done by scaling the desired velocity. However, for curved paths, e.g. those generated by blending of linear motion commands, by sensor corrections, or directly by splines, this method may leave the desired path. The problem is solved by interpolation using the arc length. In contrast to other methods, here the constraints are considered directly, resulting in a time-efficient computation. Finally, the proposed method prevents a rebound caused by the jerk limits when reaching zero velocity. Experiments are presented using a stiff KUKA robot whose path is exactly tracked during deceleration."

The sewing cell includes an industrial sewing machine as well as three industrial robots that handle the parts during the sewing process. Based on experiences from previous work, several improvements are presented that address issues with previous implementations. The main contribution concerning the control system is a model-based generation of the feed-forward velocity for the robot tool movement, based on a geometric description of the parts. This approach increases performance, especially in the case of curved fabric, as well as robustness in case of faulty sensor data. Additionally, this paper describes hardware upgrades that address mechanical challenges that were described in former publications. Finally, the paper presents experiments comparing the model-based control approach with the former control system based on constant feed-forwards velocity and setpoints."

The motion planning part of the algorithm provides vehicles with capabilities for autonomous motion planning considering nonholonomic vehicle constraints and collision-free path execution. The decision making part of the algorithm ensures safe vehicle motions and reliable conflict situation resolution. The proposed control algorithm also prevents occurrence of deadlock and livelock situations. Stability of the algorithm has been proven by its analysis based on automata theory, while its performance has been validated by simulation on a system comprising twenty vehicles as well as experimentally on a laboratory setup comprising five Pioneer 3DX vehicles."
icra,None,Collision-free path planning of industrial cooperating robots for aircraft fuselage production,"Lars Larsen,Van-Lang Pham,Jonghwa Kim,Michael Kupke,","Due to rising energy costs aircraft should have a lower kerosine consumption. To achieve this aircraft manufacturers increase the usage of high performance, lightweight materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). At the moment production needs a lot of manual steps. However the airplane structures to be built e.g. a fuselage, are up to 30m long. It is strongly recommended to automate these processes. To build these parts automatically the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed and built a large (30m × 15m × 7 m) robotic facility where multiple robots which move on linear axes share the same workspace. The sharing is important because the production process requires that the robots cooperate. Intelligent methods are necessary to generate collision-free paths for these robots."
icra,None,Estimating a Mean-Path from a set of 2-D curves,"Amir M. Ghalamzan E.,Luca Bascetta,Marcello Restelli,Paolo Rocco,","To perform many common industrial robotic tasks, e.g. deburring a work-piece, in small and medium size companies where a model of the work-piece may not be available, building a geometrical model of how to perform the task from a data set of human demonstrations is highly demanded. In many cases, however, the human demonstrations may be sub-optimal and noisy solutions to the problem of performing a task. For example, an expert may not completely remove the burrs that result in deburring residuals on the work-piece. Hence, we present an iterative algorithm to estimate a noise-free geometrical model of a work-piece from a given dataset of profiles with deburring residuals. In a case study, we compare the profiles obtained with the proposed method, nonlinear principal component analysis and Gaussian mixture model/Gaussian mixture regression. The comparison illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of accuracy, to compute a noise-free profile model of a task."
icra,None,Automatic pose optimization for robotic processes,"Ulrich Schneider,Julian Ricardo Diaz Posada,Alexander Verl,","In many robotic processes such as milling and drilling, there are multiple solutions for robot poses, as the rotation around the tool axis remains as a degree of freedom (DoF) in positioning. Yet until now, this DoF causes additional efforts in CAM programming as it requires manual intervention. Instead, this DoF can be used to optimize the robot pose according to different criteria of the robot such as stiffness or avoidance of backlash effects. This paper presents different criteria for optimization of the robot pose in machining and describes the optimization of robot stiffness based on a novel method for its identification, which is in detail described on this paper. Furthermore, the potential of the automatic resolution of the DoF is outlined enabling staff without robot knowledge to define reasonable robot paths."
icra,None,Dynamic ISD scheme for the AVM system - a preliminary study,"Yao-Sheng Hsieh,Fan-Tien Cheng,Chun-Fang Chen,Jhao-Rong Lyu,,","Reducing the sampling rate to as low as possible is a high priority for many factories to reduce production cost. Automatic-Virtual-Metrology (AVM) based Original Intelligent Sampling Decision (Original ISD) scheme had been previously developed for reducing the sampling rate and sustaining the VM accuracy. However, the desired sampling rate of the Original ISD scheme is fixed and set manually. Hence, whenever the VM accuracy gets worse, it cannot dynamically increase the desired sampling rate in the Original ISD scheme. As a consequence, it would take more time to collect enough samples for improving the VM accuracy. Moreover, when the VM accuracy performs well all the time, it cannot automatically decrease the desired sampling rate in Original ISD, which may result in unnecessary waste. Accordingly, this paper proposes a preliminary study of a Dynamic ISD scheme to dynamically and automatically modify the sampling rate online and in real time. The Dynamic ISD scheme can monitor the VM accuracy on line as well as update the VM models in real time for maintaining the VM accuracy when the VM accuracy becomes poor. Also, the Dynamic ISD scheme can automatically reduce the sampling rate while the VM accuracy performs well."
icra,None,Impedance shaping controller for robotic applications involving interacting compliant environments and compliant robot bases,"Loris Roveda,Federico Vicentini,Nicola Pedrocchi,Francesco Braghin,,","The impedance shaping control with robot base dynamics compensation is presented in this paper. The method has been conceived to avoid force overshoots in applications where the coupled dynamics of the global system (compliant robot base - controlled robot - interacting compliant environment) affects the force tracking task. Force tracking performance are obtained tuning on-line both the position set-point and the stiffness and damping parameters, based on the force error, the estimated stiffness of the interacting environment (an Extended Kalman Filter is used) and the estimated robot base position (a Kalman Filter is used). The stability of the presented strategy has been studied through Lyapunov. To validate the performance of the control an assembly task is taken into account, considering the geometrical and mechanical properties of the (partially) unknown environment. Results are compared with constant stiffness and damping impedance controllers, which show force overshoots and instabilities."
icra,None,Automatic extrinsic calibration of multiple laser range sensors with little overlap,"Jörg Röwekämper,Michael Ruhnke,Bastian Steder,Wolfram Burgard,,","Networks of laser range finders are a popular tool for monitoring large cluttered areas and to track people. Whenever multiple scanners are used for this purpose, one major problem is how to determine the relative positions of all the scanners. In this paper, we present a novel approach to calibrate a network of multiple planar laser range finders scanning horizontally. To robustly deal with the potentially restricted overlap between the fields of view, our approach only requires a dynamic object, e.g., a person, moving through the observed area. We employ a RANSAC-like algorithm to find the correspondences between the measurements of the different laser range finders. Based on these correspondences we formulate a graph-based optimization problem to determine the maximum likelihood extrinsic parameters of the sensor network. Furthermore, we present a method to evaluate the consistency of the resulting calibration based on visibility constraints. Experiments on real and simulated data show that the proposed approach yields better results than techniques that only perform pairwise calibration."
icra,None,Maximum likelihood remission calibration for groups of heterogeneous laser scanners,"Bastian Steder,Michael Ruhnke,Rainer Kümmerle,Wolfram Burgard,","Laser range scanners are commonly used in mobile robotics to enable a robot to sense the spatial configuration of its environment. In addition to the range measurements, most scanners provide remission values, representing the intensity of the returned light pulse. These values add a visual component to the measurement and can be used to improve reasoning on the data. Unfortunately, a remission value does not directly tell us how bright a measured surface is in the infrared spectrum. Rather, it varies with respect to the incidence angle and the range at which it was measured. In addition, multiple scanners typically do not agree upon the values of a certain surface. In this paper, we present a calibration method for remission values of multiple laser scanners considering dependencies in range, incidence angle of the measured surface, and the respective scanner unit. Our system learns the calibration parameters based on a set of registered point clouds. It uses a graph optimization scheme to minimize the error between different measurements, so that all involved scanners yield consistent reflection values, independent of the perspective from which the corresponding surface is observed."
icra,None,Radar and vision sensors calibration for outdoor 3D reconstruction,"Ghina El Natour,Omar Ait Aider,Raphael Rouveure,François Berry,,","In this paper we introduce a new geometric calibration algorithm, and a geometric method of 3D reconstruction using a panoramic microwave radar and a camera. These two sensors are complementary, considering the robustness to environmental conditions and depth detection ability of the radar on one hand, and the high spatial resolution of a vision sensor on the other hand. This makes the approach well adapted for large scale outdoor cartography. Firstly, we address the global calibration problem which consists in finding the exact transformation between radar and camera coordinate systems. The method is based on the optimization of a non-linear criterion obtained from a set of radar-to-image target correspondences. Unlike existing methods, no special configuration of the 3D points is required, only the knowledge of inter-targets distance is needed. This makes the method flexible and easy to use by a non expert operator. Secondly, we present a 3D reconstruction method based on sensors geometry. Both methods have been validated with synthetic and real data."
icra,None,Gyroscope-based video stabilisation with auto-calibration,"Hannes Ovrén,Per-Erik Forssén,","We propose a technique for joint calibration of a wide-angle rolling shutter camera (e.g. a GoPro) and an externally mounted gyroscope. The calibrated parameters are time scaling and offset, relative pose between gyroscope and camera, and gyroscope bias. The parameters are found using non-linear least squares minimisation using the symmetric transfer error as cost function. The primary contribution is methods for robust initialisation of the relative pose and time offset, which are essential for convergence. We also introduce a robust error norm to handle outliers. This results in a technique that works with general video content and does not require any specific setup or calibration patterns. We apply our method to stabilisation of videos recorded by a rolling shutter camera, with a rigidly attached gyroscope. After recording, the gyroscope and camera are jointly calibrated using the recorded video itself. The recorded video can then be stabilised using the calibrated parameters. We evaluate the technique on video sequences with varying difficulty and motion frequency content. The experiments demonstrate that our method can be used to produce high quality stabilised videos even under difficult conditions, and that the proposed initialisation is shown to end up within the basin of attraction. We also show that a residual based on the symmetric transfer error is more accurate than residuals based on the recently proposed epipolar plane normal coplanarity constraint, and that the use of robust errors is a critical component to obtain an accurate calibration."
icra,None,Extrinsic calibration of a set of 2D laser rangefinders,"Eduardo Fernández-Moral,Vicente Arévalo,Javier González-Jiménez,","The integration of several 2D laser rangefinders in a vehicle is a common resource employed for 3D mapping, obstacle detection and navigation. The extrinsic calibration between such sensors (i.e. finding their relative poses) is required to exploit effectively the sensor measurements and to perform data fusion. The approaches found in the literature to obtain such calibration either rely on the approximated parameters from the rig construction or propose ad-hoc solutions for specific LRF rigs. In this paper we present a novel solution for the extrinsic calibration of a set of at least three laser scanners from the information provided by the sensor measurements. This method only requires the lasers to observe a common planar surface from different orientations, thus there is no need of any specific calibration pattern. This calibration technique can be used with almost any geometric sensor configuration (except for sensors scanning parallel planes), and constitutes a versatile solution that is accurate, fast and easy to apply. This approach is validated with both simulated and real data."
icra,None,Inertial parameters identification and joint torques estimation with proximal force/torque sensing,"Silvio Traversaro,Andrea Del Prete,Serena Ivaldi,Francesco Nori,","Classically robot force control passes through joint torques measurement or estimation. Within this context, classical torque sensing technologies rely on current sensing on motor windings and on torsion sensing on motor shaft. An alternative approach was recently proposed in [1] and combines whole-body distributed 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). A further advantage of this method is that it simultaneously estimates (internal) joint torques and (external) contact forces with no need of joint redesign. As a drawback, the method relies on a model of the robot dynamics, as it consists on reordering the classical recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA). In this paper we consider the problem of the parametric identification of the robot dynamic model from embedded F/T sensors. We extend recent results on parametric identification [2] by considering an arbitrary reordering of the classical RNEA. The theoretical framework is validated on the iCub humanoid, which is equipped with both 6-axis F/T sensors and joint torque sensors. We estimated the system inertial parameters using only one F/T sensor. We used the obtained parameters to estimate the joint torques (as proposed in [1]) and compared the results with direct joint torque measurements, used in this context only as a ground truth."
icra,None,In situ calibration of six-axis force-torque sensors using accelerometer measurements,"Silvio Traversaro,Daniele Pucci,Francesco Nori,","This paper proposes techniques to calibrate six-axis force-torque sensors that can be performed in situ, i.e., without removing the sensor from the hosting system. We assume that the force-torque sensor is attached to a rigid body equipped with an accelerometer. Then, the proposed calibration technique uses the measurements of the accelerometer, but requires neither the knowledge of the inertial parameters nor the orientation of the rigid body. The proposed method exploits the geometry induced by the model between the raw measurements of the sensor and the corresponding force-torque. The validation of the approach is performed by calibrating two six-axis force-torque sensors of the iCub humanoid robot."
icra,None,Optimal excitation and identification of the dynamic model of robotic systems with compliant actuators,"Jonas Vantilt,Erwin Aertbeliën,Friedl De Groote,Joris De Schutter,","An increasing number of robotic systems are using compliant actuators in which springs are placed in series with the actuator. The need for identification procedures tailored to these systems is consequently rising. When measurements of both the link side and the motor side of the spring are available the dynamic parameters can be identified independent of the spring model. The excitation of the identification procedure is optimized for the identification of the dynamical parameters to provide a rich data set by maximizing a reduced information matrix. Adopting this reduced matrix leads to a near-optimal excitation. A Fourier series is chosen as parametrization of the excitation, resulting in a periodic movement of the system under identification. This periodicity is exploited to develop an alternative weighting of the parameter estimation. This proposed weighting uses the motor torque variance at each time step of the trajectory, instead of one global torque variance. This identification procedure is demonstrated and validated on one leg of a lower limb exoskeleton. Only the dynamic model in the sagital plane (2D) is identified."
icra,None,Ouroboros: Using potential field in unexplored regions to close loops,"Vitor A. M. Jorge,Renan Maffei,Guilherme S. Franco,Jessica Daltrozo,,,,","An autonomous robot requires a map of the environment for many tasks. Yet, in many cases, this map is unavailable and the robot must build one in real-time, in the so-called integrated exploration task. Several integrated exploration approaches adopt some sort of loop-closing strategy combined with an online simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technique. This is important because the robot can reduce the uncertainty about its pose by revisiting known areas. One solution for environment exploration is to use the vector field computed from the numeric solution of a Boundary Value Problem (BVP). This approach is called BVP Path Planner and generates smooth and free of local minima potential fields. However, this planner cannot actively close loops and does not scale well in large scenarios. In this paper we present a technique which performs active loop closure using the BVP Path Planner. Our proposal takes advantage of the potential of unexplored regions, and induces the robot to close loops by placing dynamic barriers at the visited space. The update of the potential field is boosted using a local window charged by a Voronoi diagram of the environment containing global information. We show through experimental results the effectiveness of the technique with a thorough discussion of its characteristics."
icra,None,Adaptive rectangular cuboids for 3D mapping,"Sheraz Khan,Dirk Wollherr,Martin Buss,","This paper presents an extension of the standard occupancy grid for 3D environment mapping. The presented approach adds a fusion process after the occupancy update which modifies the resolution of the grid cells in an incremental manner. Consequently, the proposed approach requires fewer grid cells for 3D representation in comparison to a standard occupancy grid. The resolution adaptation process is based on the occupancy probabilities of the grid cells and leads to the relaxation of the cubic grid cell assumption common to most 3D occupancy grids. The aim of this paper is to show the advantage of the proposed incremental fusion process which leads to the approximation of the 3D environment using rectangular cuboids. Evaluation on a large scale dataset and comparison to the state of the art shows that the proposed approach has faster access time for all occupied grid cells and requires a smaller number of cells for 3D environment representation."
icra,None,Where's waldo at time t ? using spatio-temporal models for mobile robot search,"Tomáš Krajník,Miroslav Kulich,Lenka Mudrová,Rares Ambrus,Tom Duckett,","We present a novel approach to mobile robot search for non-stationary objects in partially known environments. We formulate the search as a path planning problem in an environment where the probability of object occurrences at particular locations is a function of time. We propose to explicitly model the dynamics of the object occurrences by their frequency spectra. Using this spectral model, our path planning algorithm can construct plans that reflect the likelihoods of object locations at the time the search is performed. Three datasets collected over several months containing person and object occurrences in residential and office environments were chosen to evaluate the approach. Several types of spatio-temporal models were created for each of these datasets and the efficiency of the search method was assessed by measuring the time it took to locate a particular object. The results indicate that modeling the dynamics of object occurrences reduces the search time by 25% to 65% compared to maps that neglect these dynamics."
icra,None,Where to park? minimizing the expected time to find a parking space,"Igor Bogoslavskyi,Luciano Spinello,Wolfram Burgard,Cyrill Stachniss,","Quickly finding a free parking spot that is close to a desired target location can be a difficult task. This holds for human drivers and autonomous cars alike. In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting the occupancy of parking spaces and exploiting this information during route planning. We propose an MDP-based planner that considers route information as well as the occupancy probabilities of parking spaces to compute the path that minimizes the expected total time for finding an unoccupied parking space and for walking from the parking location to the target destination. We evaluated our system on real world data gathered over several days in a real parking lot. We furthermore compare our approach to three parking strategies and show that our method outperforms the alternative behaviors."
icra,None,Consistent ground-plane mapping: A case study utilizing low-cost sensor measurements and a satellite image,"Hang Chu,Anh Vu,","Vision-aided localization systems are often utilized in urban settings to take advantage of structured environment, high availability of unique visual features, as well as complimenting aiding measurements from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). In this paper, we present a case study for roadway texture mapping that combines low-cost sensor measurements that are already available on many production vehicles (e.g. single frequency GPS, wheel odometry, and a forward looking camera) together with a satellite image. The aim of the method presented here is to obtain high resolution texture of the ground plane that is consistent with the low-resolution satellite image through an optimization process that estimates the smooth vehicle trajectory using Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP). The main benefit of this system comes from the facts that: (1) it utilizes only low-cost sensors and information that are readily available, (2) it can be easily embedded into existing maps. Data and analysis of a drive captured around a block is used in this study."
icra,None,Integrating metric and semantic maps for vision-only automated parking,"Hugo Grimmett,Mathias Buerki,Lina Paz,Pedro Pinies,Paul Furgale,,,","We present a framework for integrating two layers of map which are often required for fully automated operation: metric and semantic. Metric maps are likely to improve with subsequent visitations to the same place, while semantic maps can comprise both permanent and fluctuating features of the environment. However, it is not clear from the state of the art how to update the semantic layer as the metric map evolves. The strengths of our method are threefold: the framework allows for the unsupervised evolution of both maps as the environment is revisited by the robot; it uses vision-only sensors, making it appropriate for production cars; and the human labelling effort is minimised as far as possible while maintaining high fidelity. We evaluate this on two different car parks with a fully automated car, performing repeated automated parking manoeuvres to demonstrate the robustness of the system."
icra,None,Active pose SLAM with RRT*,"Joan Vallvé,Juan Andrade-Cetto,","We propose a novel method for robotic exploration that evaluates paths that minimize both the joint path and map entropy per meter traveled. The method uses Pose SLAM to update the path estimate, and grows an RRT* tree to generate the set of candidate paths. This action selection mechanism contrasts with previous approaches in which the action set was built heuristically from a sparse set of candidate actions. The technique favorably compares against the classical frontier-based exploration and other Active Pose SLAM methods in simulations in a common publicly available dataset."
icra,None,"Visual-lidar odometry and mapping: low-drift, robust, and fast","Ji Zhang,Sanjiv Singh,","Here, we present a general framework for combining visual odometry and lidar odometry in a fundamental and first principle method. The method shows improvements in performance over the state of the art, particularly in robustness to aggressive motion and temporary lack of visual features. The proposed on-line method starts with visual odometry to estimate the ego-motion and to register point clouds from a scanning lidar at a high frequency but low fidelity. Then, scan matching based lidar odometry refines the motion estimation and point cloud registration simultaneously.We show results with datasets collected in our own experiments as well as using the KITTI odometry benchmark. Our proposed method is ranked #1 on the benchmark in terms of average translation and rotation errors, with a 0.75% of relative position drift. In addition to comparison of the motion estimation accuracy, we evaluate robustness of the method when the sensor suite moves at a high speed and is subject to significant ambient lighting changes."
icra,None,Monocular Localization of a moving person onboard a Quadrotor MAV,"Hyon Lim,Sudipta N. Sinha,","In this paper, we propose a novel method to recover the 3D trajectory of a moving person from a monocular camera mounted on a quadrotor micro aerial vehicle (MAV). The key contribution is an integrated approach that simultaneously performs visual odometry (VO) and persistent tracking of a person automatically detected in the scene. All computation pertaining to VO, detection and tracking runs onboard the MAV from a front-facing monocular RGB camera. Given the gravity direction from an inertial sensor and the knowledge of the individual's height, a complete 3D trajectory of the person within the reconstructed scene can be estimated. When the ground plane is detected from the triangulated 3D points, the absolute metric scale of the trajectory and the 3D map is also recovered. Our extensive indoor and outdoor experiments show that the system can localize a person moving naturally within a large area. The system runs at 17 frames per second on the onboard computer. A walking person was successfully tracked for two minutes and an accurate trajectory was recovered over a distance of 140 meters with our system running onboard."
icra,None,Foldable and self-deployable pocket sized quadrotor,"S. Mintchev,L. Daler,G. L'Eplattenier,L. Saint-Raymond,D. Floreano,","Aerial robots provide valuable support in several high-risk scenarios thanks to their capability to quickly fly to locations dangerous or even inaccessible to humans. In order to fully benefit from these features, aerial robots should be easy to transport and rapid to deploy. With this aim, this paper focuses on the development of a novel pocket sized quadrotor with foldable arms. The quadrotor can be packaged for transportation by folding its arms around the main frame. Before flight, the quadrotor's arms self-deploy in 0.3 seconds thanks to the torque generated by the propellers. The paper describes the design strategies used for developing lightweight, stiff and self-deployable foldable arms for miniature quadrotors. The arms are manufactured according to an origami technique with a foldable multi-layer material. A prototype of the quadrotor is presented as a proof of concept and performance of the system is assessed."

Its taking off and landing processes are fully autonomous. We use vision sensor to detect the landing platform, and the vision measurement is enhanced by IMU with SRUKF based sensor fusion method. All computation are done real-time and on-board. We implement the system and carry a series of experiments under various environmental conditions. The experiment results confirm the robustness and precision of our system in real use cases."
icra,None,Quadrotor landing on an inclined platform of a moving ground vehicle,"Panagiotis Vlantis,Panos Marantos,Charalampos P. Bechlioulis,Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos,","In this work we study the problem of landing a quadrotor on an inclined moving platform. The aerial robot employs an forward looking on-board camera to detect and observe the landing platform, which is carried by a mobile robot moving independently on an inclined surface. The platform may also be tilted with respect to the mobile robot. The overall goal is to design the aerial robot's control inputs such that it initially approaches the platform, while maintaining it within the camera's field of view and finally lands on it, in a way that minimizes the errors in position, attitude and velocity, while avoiding collision. Owing to the inclined ground and landing surface, the desired final state of the aerial robot is not an equilibrium state, which complicates significantly the control design. In that respect, a discrete-time non-linear model predictive controller was developed that optimizes both the trajectories and the time horizon, towards achieving the aforementioned objectives while respecting the input constraints as well. Finally, an extensive experimental study, with a Pioneer mobile robot and a Parrot ARDrone quadrotor, clarifies and verifies the theoretical findings."
icra,None,"Design of small, safe and robust quadrotor swarms","Yash Mulgaonkar,Gareth Cross,Vijay Kumar,","Scaling down the size and mass of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) increases their agility and their ability to operate in tight formations. In addition, smaller robots are safer and, as we will show in this paper, more robust to collisions. This paper addresses the development of a pico quadrotor measuring 11 cm from tip to tip, with a mass of 25g. To increase the robustness of the robot to collisions, the vehicle is equipped with a 2 gram carbon fiber cage that protects it from impact velocities in excess of 4 m/s and also permits recovery after collisions. We present the design of the electrical, mechanical and computational elements, as well as experimental results demonstrating trajectory following with feedback from an external motion camera system, recovery from collisions with walls and other robots, and formation flight."
icra,None,Mixed Integer Quadratic Program trajectory generation for a quadrotor with a cable-suspended payload,"Sarah Tang,Vijay Kumar,","In this paper, we present a trajectory planning method to navigate a quadrotor with a cable-suspended payload through known obstacle-filled environments. We model the system as a hybrid dynamical system and formulate the trajectory generation problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). Specifically, we address two novel challenges. First, we plan for a multi-body system, and obstacle avoidance must be guaranteed for the quadrotor, load, and the cable. Second, our method accommodates transitions between subsystems of the hybrid dynamical system, allowing for maneuvers that would otherwise be infeasible if the cable were constrained to remain taut. Numerical and experimental results validate the proposed approach for the full hybrid system."
icra,None,Unified motion control for dynamic quadrotor maneuvers demonstrated on slung load and rotor failure tasks,"Cédric de Crousaz,Farbod Farshidian,Michael Neunert,Jonas Buchli,","In recent years impressive results have been presented illustrating the potential of quadrotors to solve challenging tasks. Generally, the derivation of the controllers involve complex analytical manipulation of the dynamics and are very specific to the task at hand. In addition, most approaches construct a trajectory and then design a stabilizing controller in a separate step, whereas a fully optimal solution requires finding both simultaneously. In this paper, a generalized approach is presented using an iterative optimal control algorithm. A series of complex tasks are thus solved using the same algorithm without the need for manual manipulation of the system dynamics, heuristic simplifications, or manual trajectory generation. First, aggressive maneuvers are performed by requiring the quadrotor to pass with a slung load through a window not high enough for the load to pass while hanging straight down. Second, go-to-goal tasks with single and double rotor failure are demonstrated. The adaptability and applicability of this unified approach to such diverse tasks with a nonlinear, underactuated, constrained, and in the case of the slung load, hybrid quadrotor systems is thus shown."
icra,None,Multi-UAV exploration with limited communication and battery,"Kyle Cesare,Ryan Skeele,Soo-Hyun Yoo,Yawei Zhang,Geoffrey Hollinger,","We propose a multi-robot exploration algorithm that uses adaptive coordination to provide heterogeneous behavior. The key idea is to maximize the efficiency of exploring and mapping an unknown environment when a team is faced with unreliable communication and limited battery life (e.g., with aerial rotorcraft). The proposed algorithm utilizes four states: explore, meet, sacrifice, and relay. The explore state uses a frontier-based exploration algorithm, the meet state returns to the last known location of communication to share data, the sacrifice state sends the robot out to explore without consideration of remaining battery, and the relay state lands the robot until a meeting occurs. This approach allows robots to take on the role of a relay to improve communication between team members. In addition, the robots can “sacrifice” themselves by continuing to explore even when they do not have sufficient battery to return to the base station. We compare the performance of the proposed approach to state-of-the-art frontier-based exploration, and results show gains in explored area. The feasibility of components of the proposed approach is also demonstrated on a team of two custom-built quadcopters exploring an office environment."
icra,None,Pseudo-rigid-body model and kinematic analysis of MRI-actuated catheters,"Tipakorn Greigarn,M. Cenk Çavuşoğlu,","This paper presents a kinematic study of a pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) of MRI-compatible, magnetically actuated, steerable catheters. It includes a derivation of a mathematical model of the PRBM of the catheter, singularity studies of the model, and a new manipulability measure. While the forward kinematics of the model presented here is applicable to PRBMs for other applications, actuation method is unique to the particular design. Hence, a careful study of singularities and manipulability of the model is required. The singularities are studied from the underlying equations of motion with intuitive interpretations. The proposed manipulability measure is a generalization of the inverse condition number manipulability measure of robotic manipulators. While the PRBM is an approximation of the flexible catheter, kinematic studies of the PRBM still provide some insight into feasibility and limitations of the catheter, which is beneficial to the design and motion planning of the catheter."
icra,None,Remote electromagnetic vibration of steerable needles for imaging in power Doppler ultrasound,"Sarah S. Cabreros,Nina M. Jimenez,Joseph D. Greer,Troy K. Adebar,,","Robotic needle steering systems for minimally invasive medical procedures require complementary medical imaging systems to track the needles in real time. Ultrasound is a promising imaging modality because it offers relatively low-cost, real-time imaging of the needle. Previous methods applied vibration to the base of the needle using a voice coil actuator, in order to make the needle visible in power Doppler ultrasound. We propose a new method for needle tip vibration, using electromagnetic actuation of small permanent magnets placed inside the needle to improve needle tip visibility in power Doppler imaging. Robotic needle insertion experiments using artificial tissue and ex vivo porcine liver showed that the electromagnetic tip vibration method can generate a stronger Doppler response compared to the previous base vibration method, resulting in better imaging at greater needle depth in tissue. It also eliminates previous issues with vibration damping along the shaft of the needle."

The proposed solution is based on a duty-cycling visual servoing strategy we designed in a previous work, and on a new needle tracking algorithm for 3D ultrasound. The flexible needle modeled as a polynomial curve is tracked during automatic insertion using particle filtering. This new tracking algorithm enables real-time closed-loop needle control with 3D ultrasound feedback. Experimental results of a targeting task demonstrate the robustness of the proposed tracking algorithm and the feasibility of 3D ultrasound-guided needle steering."
icra,None,Designing snap-free concentric tube robots: A local bifurcation approach,"Richard J. Hendrick,Hunter B. Gilbert,Robert J. Webster,","In designing concentric tube robots, it is often desirable to use curvatures that are as high as possible. However, with high curvatures comes the potential for elastic instabilities. This can be addressed by motion planning or by designing the robot to preclude the possibility of instability. In this paper, we pursue the latter. Our primary contribution is to show that local bifurcation theory can be used to predict the existence of elastic instability anywhere in the workspace of robots with arbitrarily many tubes, with straight transmissions. We show how to use these results to design robots that are guaranteed to remain elastically stable at all times."
icra,None,A mechanics-based model for simulation and control of flexible needle insertion in soft tissue,"Mohsen Khadem,Bita Fallahi,Carlos Rossa,Ron S. Sloboda,Nawaid Usmani,,","In needle-based medical procedures, beveled-tip flexible needles are steered inside soft tissue with the aim of reaching pre-defined target locations. The efficiency of needle-based interventions depends on accurate control of the needle tip. This paper presents a comprehensive mechanics-based model for simulation of planar needle insertion in soft tissue. The proposed model for needle deflection is based on beam theory, works in real-time, and accepts the insertion velocity as an input that can later be used as a control command for needle steering. The model takes into account the effects of tissue deformation, needle-tissue friction, tissue cutting force, and needle bevel angle on needle deflection. Using a robot that inserts a flexible needle into a phantom tissue, various experiments are conducted to separately identify different subsets of the model parameters. The validity of the proposed model is verified by comparing the simulation results to the empirical data. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting the needle tip deflection for different insertion velocities."
icra,None,Development and experimental validation of a force sensing needle for robotically assisted retinal vein cannulations,"A. Gijbels,E.B. Vander Poorten,P. Stalmans,D. Reynaerts,","Retinal Vein Occlusion is a common retinal vascular disorder which can cause severe loss of vision. Retinal vein cannulation and subsequent injection of anti-coagulant in the affected vein is a promising treatment. Given the scale and the fragility of retinal veins on one side and the surgeons limited positioning precision and force perception on the other side, this procedure is considered too risky to perform manually at the moment. The paper tackles the limited force perception problem. The development of a novel force sensing cannulation needle based on Fiber Bragg Gratings is reported. The design, the calibration method and the experimental characterization of the produced force sensor are discussed. The functionality of the needle is validated by measuring puncture forces during cannulations in a custom-made retina model."
icra,None,Needle shape estimation in soft tissue based on partial ultrasound image observation,"Jay Carriere,Carlos Rossa,Nawaid Usmani,Ronald Sloboda,Mahdi Tavakoli,","We propose a method to estimate the entire shape of a long flexible needle, suitable for a needle insertion assistant robot. This method bases its prediction on only a small segment of a needle, imaged via ultrasound, after insertion. An algorithm is developed that can segment a needle observed partially in ultrasound images and fully in camera images, returning a polynomial representation of the needle shape after RANSAC processing. The polynomial corresponding to the partial needle observation in ultrasound images is used as the input to a needle-tissue interaction model that predicts the entire needle shape. The needle shape predicted by the model is compared to the segmented needle shape based on camera images to validate the proposed approach. The results show that the entire needle shape can be accurately predicted in tissues of varying stiffness based on observation of parts of the needle in an ultrasound image."
icra,None,Modeling and steering of a novel actuated-tip needle through a soft-tissue simulant using Fiber Bragg Grating sensors,"Roy J. Roesthuis,Nick J. van de Berg,John J. van den Dobbelsteen,,","Needle insertions are common during surgical procedures. Accurately delivering the needle at a specific location in the human body is of importance for the clinical outcome of the procedure. Studies have already shown that robotically inserting traditional needles with a bevel tip can improve targeting accuracy. However, steering of such needles requires spinning the needle, which may lead to additional tissue damage. Therefore, we propose a novel design consisting of a flexible needle with a tendon-driven actuated-tip. Changing the orientation of the actuated-tip allows to control the steering direction of the needle and the amount of deflection. We derive the kinematic model which describes the needle path given the actuated-tip orientation based on nonholonomic kinematics. We present a method for steering the needle towards a target location in soft tissue. This method incorporates online parameter estimation in order to adapt for changes in tissue stiffness. Needle insertion experiments are performed in soft-tissue simulants, made from porcine gelatin. Needle tip pose is measured during insertion using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) based shape reconstruction. Results show that the needle can be steered towards targets located at 20 mm from the initial insertion axis, at a depth of 100 mm with a mean targeting error of 2.02 mm."
icra,None,An online and approximate solver for POMDPs with continuous action space,"Konstantin M. Seiler,Hanna Kurniawati,Surya P. N. Singh,","For agile, accurate autonomous robotics, it is desirable to plan motion in the presence of uncertainty. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a principled framework for this. Despite the tremendous advances of POMDP-based planning, most can only solve problems with a small and discrete set of actions. This paper presents General Pattern Search in Adaptive Belief Tree (GPS-ABT), an approximate and online POMDP solver for problems with continuous action spaces. Generalized Pattern Search (GPS) is used as a search strategy for action selection. Under certain conditions, GPS-ABT converges to the optimal solution in probability. Results on a box pushing and an extended Tag benchmark problem are promising."
icra,None,Control of generalized contact motion and force in physical human-robot interaction,"Emanuele Magrini,Fabrizio Flacco,Alessandro De Luca,","During human-robot interaction tasks, a human may physically touch a robot and engage in a collaboration phase with exchange of contact forces and/or requiring coordinated motion of a common contact point. Under the premise of keeping the interaction safe, the robot controller should impose a desired motion/force behavior at the contact or explicitly regulate the contact forces. Since intentional contacts may occur anywhere along the robot structure, the ability of controlling generalized contact motion and force becomes an essential robot feature. In our recent work, we have shown how to estimate contact forces without an explicit force sensing device, relying on residual signals to detect contact and on the use of an external (depth) sensor to localize the contact point. Based on this result, we introduce two control schemes that generalize the impedance and direct force control paradigms to a generic contact location on the robot, making use of the estimated contact forces. The issue of human-robot task compatibility is pointed out in case of control of generalized contact forces. Experimental results are presented for a KUKA LWR robot using a Kinect sensor."
icra,None,Grasping without squeezing: Shear adhesion gripper with fibrillar thin film,"Elliot W. Hawkes,David L. Christensen,Amy Kyungwon Han,Hao Jiang,,","Nearly all robotic grippers have one trait in common: they grasp objects with normal forces, either directly, or indirectly through friction. This method of grasping is effective for objects small enough for a given gripper to partially encompass. However, to grasp larger objects, significant grip forces and a high coefficient of friction are required. We present a new grasping method for convex objects, using almost exclusively shear forces. We achieve shear grasping with a gripper that utilizes thin film gecko-inspired fibrillar adhesives that conform to the curvature of the object. We present a verified model for grasping a range of curvatures and results that demonstrate the thin film fibrillar adhesives' increased contact area on textured surfaces when loaded in shear. Finally, the gripper is implemented on a robotic arm and grasps a variety of convex objects (at rest and ballistic)."

Yip,Günter Niemeyer,","Natural muscles exhibit high power-to-weight ratios, inherent compliance and damping, fast actuation and high dynamic ranges. Unfortunately, traditional robotic actuators have been unable to attain similar properties, especially in a slender muscle-like form factor. Recently, super-coiled polymer (SCP) actuators have rejuvenated the promise of an artificial muscle. Constructed from commercial nylon fishing line or sewing thread and twisted until coils form, these lightweight actuators have been shown to produce significant mechanical power when thermally cycled. In this paper, we develop a thermomechanical and thermoelectric model of SCP actuators, and examine their controllability. With off-the-shelf conductive sewing thread, we show the ability to produce controlled forces in under 30 ms, exceeding human muscle performance.

Because the model contains unknown parameters, such as sensor biases, the problem is usually cast as a mixed filtering/identification, with the resulting observability analysis providing necessary conditions for convergence to a unique point estimate. Most models treat sensor bias rates as “noise,” independent of other states, including biases themselves, an assumption that is patently violated in practice. We show that, when this assumption is lifted, the resulting model is not observable, and therefore existing analyses cannot be used to conclude that the set of states that are indistinguishable from the measurements is a singleton. In other words, the resulting model is not observable. We therefore re-cast the analysis as one of sensitivity: Rather than attempting to prove that the set of indistinguishable trajectories is a singleton, we derive bounds on its volume, as a function of characteristics of the sensor and other sufficient excitation conditions. This provides an explicit characterization of the indistinguishable set that can be used for analysis and validation purposes."
icra,None,Flight control systems of a quad tilt rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for a large attitude change,"Atsushi Oosedo,Satoko Abiko,Shota Narasaki,Atsushi Kuno,Atsushi Konno,,","Quad tilt rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) solves the problem of underacuated system in general quadrotor UAV. The quad tilt rotor UAV can control position and attitude independently by tilting directions of propellers. However, the flight control system in a wide range of attitudes has not been discussed yet, e.g. a UAV flying and hovering with a 90 [°] pitch angle and can flip over when the range of the tilting motor rotates wide enough. In this paper, we present the attitude transition flight control system for pitch angles ranging 0 [°] to 90 [°] since flight condition with a 90 [°] pitch angle significantly differs from that in a conventional quadrotor UAV flight, and then adequate control system and sufficient experimental validation are necessary for stable flight in a wide range of attitude conditions."
icra,None,Learning legged swimming gaits from experience,"David Meger,Juan Camilo Gamboa Higuera,Anqi Xu,Philippe Giguère,,","We present an end-to-end framework for realizing fully automated gait learning for a complex underwater legged robot. Using this framework, we demonstrate that a hexapod flipper-propelled robot can learn task-specific control policies purely from experience data. Our method couples a state-of-the-art policy search technique with a family of periodic low-level controls that are well suited for underwater propulsion. We demonstrate the practical efficacy of tabula rasa learning, that is, learning without the use of any prior knowledge, of policies for a six-legged swimmer to carry out a variety of acrobatic maneuvers in three dimensional space. We also demonstrate informed learning that relies on simulated experience from a realistic simulator. In numerous cases, novel emergent gait behaviors have arisen from learning, such as the use of one stationary flipper to create drag while another oscillates to create thrust. Similar effective results have been demonstrated in under-actuated configurations, where as few as two flippers are used to maneuver the robot to a desired pose, or through an acrobatic motion such as a corkscrew. The success of our learning framework is assessed both in simulation and in the field using an underwater swimming robot."
icra,None,Movement primitives via optimization,"Anca D. Dragan,Katharina Muelling,J. Andrew Bagnell,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,","We formalize the problem of adapting a demonstrated trajectory to a new start and goal configuration as an optimization problem over a Hilbert space of trajectories: minimize the distance between the demonstration and the new trajectory subject to the new end point constraints. We show that the commonly used version of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) implement this minimization in the way they adapt demonstrations, for a particular choice of the Hilbert space norm. The generalization to arbitrary norms enables the robot to select a more appropriate norm for the task, as well as learn how to adapt the demonstration from the user. Our experiments show that this can significantly improve the robot's ability to accurately generalize the demonstration."
icra,None,Path-guided artificial potential fields with stochastic reachable sets for motion planning in highly dynamic environments,"Hao-Tien Chiang,Nick Malone,Kendra Lesser,Meeko Oishi,Lydia Tapia,","Highly dynamic environments pose a particular challenge for motion planning due to the need for constant evaluation or validation of plans. However, due to the wide range of applications, an algorithm to safely plan in the presence of moving obstacles is required. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that provides computationally efficient planning solutions in environments with static obstacles and several dynamic obstacles with stochastic motions. Path-Guided APF-SR works by first applying a sampling-based technique to identify a valid, collision-free path in the presence of static obstacles. Then, an artificial potential field planning method is used to safely navigate through the moving obstacles using the path as an attractive intermediate goal bias. In order to improve the safety of the artificial potential field, repulsive potential fields around moving obstacles are calculated with stochastic reachable sets, a method previously shown to significantly improve planning success in highly dynamic environments. We show that Path-Guided APF-SR outperforms other methods that have high planning success in environments with 300 stochastically moving obstacles. Furthermore, planning is achievable in environments in which previously developed methods have failed."
icra,None,Efficient path planning for high-DOF articulated robots with adaptive dimensionality,"Dong-Hyung Kim,Youn-Sung Choi,Taejoon Park,Ji Yeong Lee,Chang-Soo Han,","This paper proposes a method for path planning of high-degree of freedom (DOF) articulated robots with adaptive dimensionality. For an efficient path planning in high-dimensional C-space (configuration space), first we describe an adaptive body selection that selects the robot bodies and joints depending on the complexity of path planning. It means that the robot may use necessary DOF to achieve a path planning task. The adaptive body selection method builds the C-space with adaptive dimensionality for a sampling-based path planner. Next, by using the adaptive body selection, the adaptive Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is introduced, which incrementally grows RRTs in the adaptive dimensional C-space. And we show through several simulation results that the proposed method is more efficient than the original RRT-based path planner, which requires full-dimensional planning."
icra,None,A motion planning approach to automatic obstacle avoidance during concentric tube robot teleoperation,"Luis G. Torres,Alan Kuntz,Hunter B. Gilbert,Philip J. Swaney,Richard J. Hendrick,,,","Concentric tube robots are thin, tentacle-like devices that can move along curved paths and can potentially enable new, less invasive surgical procedures. Safe and effective operation of this type of robot requires that the robot's shaft avoid sensitive anatomical structures (e.g., critical vessels and organs) while the surgeon teleoperates the robot's tip. However, the robot's unintuitive kinematics makes it difficult for a human user to manually ensure obstacle avoidance along the entire tentacle-like shape of the robot's shaft. We present a motion planning approach for concentric tube robot teleoperation that enables the robot to interactively maneuver its tip to points selected by a user while automatically avoiding obstacles along its shaft. We achieve automatic collision avoidance by precomputing a roadmap of collision-free robot configurations based on a description of the anatomical obstacles, which are attainable via volumetric medical imaging. We also mitigate the effects of kinematic modeling error in reaching the goal positions by adjusting motions based on robot tip position sensing. We evaluate our motion planner on a teleoperated concentric tube robot and demonstrate its obstacle avoidance and accuracy in environments with tubular obstacles."
icra,None,Optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints: The driftless case,"Edward Schmerling,Lucas Janson,Marco Pavone,","Motion planning under differential constraints is a classic problem in robotics. To date, the state of the art is represented by sampling-based techniques, with the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm as a leading example. Yet, the problem is still open in many aspects, including guarantees on the quality of the obtained solution. In this paper we provide a thorough theoretical framework to assess optimality guarantees of sampling-based algorithms for planning under differential constraints. We exploit this framework to design and analyze two novel sampling-based algorithms that are guaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an optimal solution (namely, the Differential Probabilistic RoadMap algorithm and the Differential Fast Marching Tree algorithm). Our focus is on driftless control-affine dynamical models, which accurately model a large class of robotic systems. In this paper we use the notion of convergence in probability (as opposed to convergence almost surely): the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach yields convergence rate bounds - a first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints. Numerical experiments corroborating our theoretical results are presented and discussed."
icra,None,Dynamic Multi-Heuristic A*,"Fahad Islam,Venkatraman Narayanan,Maxim Likhachev,","Many motion planning problems in robotics are high dimensional planning problems. While sampling-based motion planning algorithms handle the high dimensionality very well, the solution qualities are often hard to control due to the inherent randomization. In addition, they suffer severely when the configuration space has several `narrow passages'. Search-based planners on the other hand typically provide good solution qualities and are not affected by narrow passages. However, in the absence of a good heuristic or when there are deep local minima in the heuristic, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this work, our primary contribution is a method for dynamically generating heuristics, in addition to the original heuristic(s) used, to guide the search out of local minima. With the ability to escape local minima easily, the effect of dimensionality becomes less pronounced. On the theoretical side, we provide guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality of the solution found. We compare our proposed method with the recently published Multi-Heuristic A* search, and the popular RRT-Connect in a full-body mobile manipulation domain for the PR2 robot, and show its benefits over these approaches."
icra,None,Operation of the ballbot on slopes and with center-of-mass offsets,"Bhaskar Vaidya,Michael Shomin,Ralph Hollis,George Kantor,","The ballbot is a human sized, dynamically stable mobile robot that balances on a single, spherical wheel. The current framework for navigation and control makes the assumption that the robot is operating on a level surface without any center-of-mass offset; however, in practice, such a dynamically stable robot has to be able to successfully navigate sloped surfaces and with such offsets. This work develops the equations of motion for the ballbot system on a sloped surface with a center-of-mass offset. The equilibria of this system are analyzed, and a compensation strategy is formulated that allows the ballbot to operate in the presence of slopes and center-of-mass offsets. This work also develops estimation algorithms for slope and center-of-mass offset angles during station-keeping and trajectory following. Results for compensation and estimation are demonstrated experimentally."
icra,None,The planner ensemble: Motion planning by executing diverse algorithms,"Sanjiban Choudhury,Sankalp Arora,Sebastian Scherer,","Autonomous systems that navigate in unknown environments encounter a variety of planning problems. The success of any one particular planning strategy depends on the validity of assumptions it leverages about the structure of the problem, e.g., Is the cost map locally convex? Does the feasible state space have good connectivity? We address the problem of determining suitable motion planning strategies that can work on a diverse set of applications. We have developed a planning system that does this by running competing planners in parallel. In this paper, we present an approach that constructs a planner ensemble - a set of complementary planners that lever-age a diverse set of assumptions. Our approach optimizes the submodular selection criteria with a greedy approach and lazy evaluation. We seed our selection with learnt priors on planner performance, thus allowing us to solve new applications without evaluating every planner on that application. We present results in simulation where the selected ensemble outperforms the best single planner and does almost as well as an off-line planner. We also present results from an autonomous helicopter that has flown missions several kilometers long at speeds of up to 56m/s which involved avoiding unmapped mountains, no-fly zones and landing in cluttered areas with trees and buildings. This work opens the door on the more general problem of adaptive motion planning."
icra,None,Planning the motion of a sliding and rolling sphere,"Yan-Bin Jia,","This paper investigates the free motion of a sphere with initial velocity and angular velocity on a plane under sliding and rolling friction. The sphere will first slide along a parabolic trajectory (with a constant direction of its contact velocity), and then roll along a straight trajectory. Such a curved trajectory can be utilized for obstacle avoidance in path planning. A one-to-one correspondence exists between trajectories connecting two specified locations and pairs of sliding and rolling directions within some 2-dimensional region, called the trajectory space, which is then used for planning. A plane sweep algorithm operating in this space is presented to find all collision-free trajectories in the presence of cylindrical obstacles that are vertically oriented."

The objective is to synthesize trajectories for dynamic robotic systems that improve the estimation of model parameters by using a metric on Fisher information in a nonlinear projection-based trajectory optimization algorithm. A simulation of a robot with a suspended double pendulum is used as an example system to illustrate the algorithm. Results from the simulation show that the change to a discrete mechanics formulation reduces the computation time by a factor of 19 when compared to the continuous algorithm while maintaining the same two orders of magnitude improvement in the Fisher information from the continuous-time formulation. Through the Cramer-Rao bound, the improvement in the Fisher information results in a maximum expected error reduction of the parameter estimates by up to a factor of 10 2 ."
icra,None,Robust 3D tracking of unknown objects,"Alessandro Pieropan,Niklas Bergström,Masatoshi Ishikawa,Hedvig Kjellström,","Visual tracking of unknown objects is an essential task in robotic perception, of importance to a wide range of applications. In the general scenario, the robot has no full 3D model of the object beforehand, just the partial view of the object visible in the first video frame. A tracker with this information only will inevitably lose track of the object after occlusions or large out-of-plane rotations. The way to overcome this is to incrementally learn the appearances of new views of the object. However, this bootstrapping approach is sensitive to drifting due to occasional inclusion of the background into the model."
icra,None,Distortion invariant joint-feature for visual tracking in catadioptric omnidirectional vision,"Yazhe Tang,Y.F. Li,Shuzhi Sam Ge,Jun Luo,Hongliang Ren,","Central catadioptric omnidirectional images exhibit serious nonlinear distortions due to quadratic mirrors involved. Conventional visual features developed based on the perspective model are hard to achieve a satisfactory performance when directly applied to the distorted omnidirectional image. This paper presents a parameterized neighborhood model to efficiently calculate the adaptive neighborhood of an object based on the measurable radial distance in image plane. On the basis of the parameterized neighborhood model, a distortion invariant joint-feature framework implemented with contour-color fragment mixture model of Gaussian is proposed for visual tracking in catadioptric omnidirectional camera system. Under the framework of Gaussian Mixture Model, the problem of feature matching is converted into feature clustering. A weight contribution mechanism is presented to flexibly weight the fragments based on their responses, which makes the system robustly guided by limited visible fragments even when serious partial occlusion happens. The experiments validate the performance of the proposed algorithm."
icra,None,Human feet tracking guided by locomotion model,"Ying Li,Sihao Ding,Qiang Zhai,Yuan F. Zheng,Dong Xuan,","Following a person is a fundamental requirement for human-robot interaction. In this paper we propose a novel tracking approach for robust human feet tracking which integrates human locomotion into tracking algorithms. The vertical displacement between the two feet is analyzed and we observe that this displacement during the walking cycle is close to a modulated cosine waveform. Based on this, we propose an adaptive model for the human walking pattern. We divide the motion of the human feet into local motion and global motion. The local motion is modeled by a modified cosine wave that updates along time. Global motion is estimated by the continuity between successive frames. This model is combined with particle filtering to guide the searching of the feet. A 2D Gaussian mask is generated according to the predicted position estimated by the motion model and used to modify the weight of the particles. Experiments are implemented in several human walking videos and the algorithm is evaluated against the generic particle filtering method. Results show that the feet can be tracked successfully with significant improvements compared to the generic particle filtering method."
icra,None,Real-time tracking of deformable target in 3D ultrasound images,"Lucas Royer,Maud Marchal,Anthony Le Bras,Guillaume Dardenne,,","In this paper, we present a novel approach for tracking a deformable anatomical target within 3D ultrasound volumes. Our method is able to estimate deformations caused by the physiological motions of the patient. The displacements of moving structures are estimated from an intensity-based approach combined with a physically-based model and has therefore the advantage to be less sensitive to the image noise. Furthermore, our method does not use any fiducial marker and has real-time capabilities. The accuracy of our method is evaluated on real data acquired from an organic phantom. The validation is performed on different types of motions comprising rigid and non-rigid motions. Thus, our approach opens novel possibilities for computer-assisted interventions where deformable organs are involved."
icra,None,Tracking handheld object using three layer RGB-D image space,"Krishneel Chaudhary,Yasushi Mae,Masaru Kojima,Tatsuo Arai,","Visual tracking of objects subjected to non-linear motion and appearance changes has shown to be a difficult task in computer vision. While research in visual object tracking has progressed significantly in terms of robust tracking of objects subjected to non-linear motion and appearance changes, these algorithms has shown limited capability for long term tracking of handheld objects during human-object interactions. The failure in tracking is a consequence of abrupt changes in the handheld object motion resulting in tracker drifting off the optimal object space. In this paper, we present a novel 3 layer RGB-D image model formulated with Bayesian filters that tracks handheld object using near constant velocity motion model. Our method divides the image into three layers of abstraction where each encodes visual information of environment, human, object and contributes toward precise localization of the handheld object during tracking. A boundary re-alignment step is introduced during tracking such that the tracker predicted object region is re-aligned to the optimal object region, therefore reducing the likelihood of tracker drifting off the object space. This compensation of the tracker prediction offset enables our algorithm to robustly track handheld object subjected to abrupt changes in motion during manipulation."
icra,None,Robust ground plane tracking in cluttered environments from egocentric stereo vision,"Tobias Schwarze,Martin Lauer,","Estimating the ground plane is often one of the first steps in geometric reasoning processes as it offers easily accessible context knowledge. Especially unconstrained platforms that capture video from egocentric viewpoints can benefit from such knowledge in various ways. A key requirement here is keeping orientation, which can be greatly achieved by keeping track of the ground. We present an approach to keep track of the ground plane in cluttered inner-urban environments using stereo vision in real-time. We fuse a planar model fit in low-resolution disparity data with the direction of the vertical vanishing point. Our experiments show how this effectively decreases the error of plane attitude estimation compared to classic least-squares fitting and allows to track the plane with camera configurations in which the ground is not visible. We evaluate the approach using ground-truth from an inertial measurement unit and demonstrate long-term stability on a dataset of challenging inner city scenes."

For these tasks both high DOF motion and high accuracy is needed. We describe in detail, both the process of recording the sequences and how ground truth data was generated for the videos. The videos are tagged with challenges that a tracker would face while tracking the object. As an initial example, we evaluate the performance of six published trackers [5], [11], [12], [13], [15], [6] and analyse their result. We describe a new evaluation metric to test sensitivity of trackers to speed. A total of 100 annotated and tagged sequences are reported. All the videos, ground truth data, original implementation of trackers and evaluation scripts are made publicly available on the website so others can extend the results on their trackers and evaluation."

icra,None,Segmentation performance in tracking deformable objects via WNNs,"Mariacarla Staffa,Silvia Rossi,Maurizio Giordano,Massimo De Gregorio,,","In many real life scenarios, which span from domestic interactions to industrial manufacturing processes, the objects to be manipulated are non-rigid and deformable, hence, both the location of the object and its deformation have to be tracked. Different methodologies have been applied in literature, using different sensors and techniques for addressing this problem. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a Weightless Neural Network approach for non-rigid deformable object tracking. The proposed approach allows deploying an on-line training on the shape features of the object, to adapt in real-time to changes, and to partially cope with occlusions. Moreover, the use of parallel classifiers trained on the same set of images allows tracking the movements of the objects. In this work, we evaluate the filtering/segmentation performance that is a fundamental step for the correct operation of our approach, in the scenario of pizza making."
icra,None,Quasi-direct nonprehensile catching with uncertain object states,"Markus M. Schill,Felix Gruber,Martin Buss,","One of the key challenges in dynamic manipulation is to establish continuous contact between a moving object and a manipulator. Direct robotic catching is a benchmark in this context, especially without grasping devices. In this paper, we explain why it is unrewarding to aim for an ideal initial dynamic contact if only imprecise knowledge of the object states is available. Robust initial contacts are proposed such that a successful quasi-direct catch can be predicted. The proposed robustness originates in a negative relative acceleration between object and catching end-effector. Sets, for which an upper negative relative acceleration bound holds, are evaluated throughout an exemplary catching motion. Reachable set computations allow to express and visualize these sets of successful object states at any point in time before contact. The paper closes with a robot-robot experiment that shows successful quasi-direct catches without feedback on the object states for a robotic throw."
icra,None,A stochastic dynamic motion planning algorithm for object-throwing,"Avishai Sintov,Amir Shapiro,","A novel algorithm is proposed for offline motion planning of a robotic arm to perform a throw task of an object to reach a goal target. The planning algorithm searches for a throw trajectory that could be performed under kinematic and dynamic (i.e., kinodynamic) constraints. We parameterize the throw trajectory by a time-invariant high-dimensional vector. Then, the kinodynamic and target constraints are formulated in terms of time and the parameterization vector. These constraints form time-varying subspaces in the parameterization space. We present a stochastic method for finding a feasible and optimal solution within the subspace. The method generates a number of random points within the parameterization space and checks their feasibility using an adaptive search. The algorithm is guaranteed under a known probability to find a solution if one exists. We present simulations and experiments on a 3R manipulator to validate the method."

By creating optimal trajectories offline and deforming them online, computational complexity during execution is reduced considerably. As tight convex hulls of the deformed trajectories can be found, possible obstacles or workspace boundaries can be circumnavigated precisely without collision. The approach is verified through experiments on an inclined planar air-table for volleyball scenario using two 3-DoF robots."
icra,None,An online method for tight-tolerance insertion tasks for string and rope,"Weifu Wang,Dmitry Berenson,Devin Balkcom,","This paper presents a fast tight-tolerance threading technique for string and rope. Instead of relying on simulations of these deformable objects to plan a path or compute control actions, we control the movement of the string with a virtual magnetic vector field emanating from the narrow openings we wish to thread through. We compute an approximate Jacobian to move the tip of the string through the vector field and propose a method to promote alignment of the head of the string to the opening. We also propose a method for re-grasping the string based on the relationship between the string's configuration, the orientation of the opening, and direction of gravity. This re-grasping method in conjunction with our controller can be used to thread the string through a sequence of openings. We evaluated our method in simulation (with simulated sensor noise) and on the Da Vinci surgical robot. Our results suggest that our method is quite robust to errors in sensing, and is capable of real-world threading tasks with the da Vinci robot, where the diameter of the string (3.5mm) and opening (4.9mm) differ by only 1.4 mm."
icra,None,Multi-step planning for robotic manipulation,"Max Pflueger,Gaurav S. Sukhatme,","Most current systems capable of robotic object manipulation involve ad hoc assumptions about the order of operations necessary to achieve a task, and usually have no mechanism to predict how earlier decisions will affect the quality of the solution later. Solving this problem is sometimes referred to as combined task and motion planning. We propose that multi-step planning, a technique previously applied in some other domains, is an effective way to address the question of combined task and motion planning. We demonstrate the technique on a complex motion planning problem involving a two-armed robot (PR2) and an articulated object (folding chair) where our planner naturally discovers extra steps that are necessary to satisfy kinematic constraints of the problem. We also propose some further extensions to our algorithm that we believe will make it an extremely powerful technique in this domain."

The manipulation method, where two DOF (degrees of freedom) motion of an object on the plate surface is controlled by a single active joint, is proposed. For the plate vibration mechanism, we newly introduce an active-passive hybrid joint whose two axes are arranged in nonparallel to each other. This mechanism features the plate vibration trajectory is variable based on the input frequency. We then analytically derive the trajectory of object on the vibrating plate. Through this analysis, we reveal that two DOF motion of the object can be controlled by utilizing the variable vibration effect. Finally, we show experimental result by using the prototype robot, for confirming the validity of the proposed method."

We embed a physics model into the planner to allow reasoning about interaction with objects in the environment. By carefully selecting this model, we are able to reduce our state and action space, gaining tractability in the search. The result is a planner capable of generating trajectories for full arm manipulation and simultaneous object interaction. We demonstrate the ability to solve more rearrangement by pushing tasks than existing primitive based solutions. Finally, we show the plans we generate are feasible for execution on a real robot."

The objective of this study is to control an object's orientation with respect to the gravitational force direction by using an active plate for realizing hitherto unrealized object motion. In this context, motions of the object and active plate are designed to be cyclic. A state vector composed of the object's angle and angular velocity is defined, and the cyclic motion is expressed as a nonlinear discrete system. Fixed points of the state vector are searched for in the designed cyclic motion. A stability analysis around the fixed points is conducted using a Poincaré map. As a result, the fixed points are shown to be asymptotically stable. Finally, experimental results are used to verify that the object's angle can be manipulated with the designed cyclic motion using the plate."
icra,None,Sample-based motion planning for robot manipulators with closed kinematic chains,"M. Bonilla,E. Farnioli,L. Pallottino,A. Bicchi,","Random sampling-based methods for motion planning of constrained robot manipulators have been widely studied in recent years. The main problem to deal with is the lack of an explicit parametrization of the non linear submanifold in the Configuration Space (CS) imposed by the constraints in the system. Most of the proposed planning methods use projections to generate valid configurations of the system slowing the planning process. Recently, new robot mechanism includes compliance either in the structure or in the controllers. In this kind of robot most of the times the planned trajectories are not executed exactly due to uncertainties and interactions with the environment. Indeed, controller references are generated such that the constraint is violated to indirectly generate forces during interactions. With the purpose of avoiding projections, in this paper we take advantage of the compliance of systems to relax the geometric constraints imposed by closed kinematic chains. The relaxed constraint is then used in a state-of-the-art suboptimal random sampling based technique to generate paths for constrained robot manipulators. As a consequence of relaxation, arising contact forces acting on the constraint change from configuration to configuration during the planned path. Those forces can be regulated using a proper controller that takes advantage of the geometric decoupling of the subspaces describing constrained rigid-body motions of the mechanism and the controllable forces."
icra,None,Dynamics and trajectory optimization for a soft spatial fluidic elastomer manipulator,"Andrew D. Marchese,Russ Tedrake,Daniela Rus,","The goal of this work is to develop a soft robotic manipulation system that is capable of autonomous, dynamic, and safe interactions with humans and its environment. First, we develop a dynamic model for a multi-body fluidic elastomer manipulator that is composed entirely from soft rubber and subject to the self-loading effects of gravity. Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all unknown components of the system: the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as drive cylinders that supply fluid energy. Next, using this model and trajectory optimization techniques we find locally optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs. In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92% of the time. By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines."
icra,None,An under actuated robotic arm with adjustable stiffness shape memory polymer joints,"Amir Firouzeh,Seyed Sina Mirrazavi Salehian,Aude Billard,Jamie Paik,","Various robotic applications including surgical instruments, wearable robots and autonomous mobile robots are often constrained with strict design requirements on high degrees of freedom (DoF) and minimal volume and weight. An intuitive design to meet these contradictory requirements is to embed locking mechanism in under actuated robotic manipulators to direct the actuation from a single and remote source to drive different joints on demand. Mechanical clutches do serve such purposes but often are bulky and require auxiliary mechanism making it difficult to justify the high cost adding the additional DoF, especially in cm scale. Here, we introduce an under-actuated robotic arm with shape memory polymer (SMP) joints. Through controlling the temperature, the stiffness of the joints can be adjusted and selected joints will be activated while the rest are fixed in their position. The presented prototype can control the joints independently with a coupled actuation from two stepper motors. Since we have redundant DoFs in the arm, there can be more than one configuration to reach a given position. We use a probabilistic technique to determine the optimum configuration with the minimum number of active joints that can yield the desired posture. In this paper, we report on the performance of the proposed design for the hardware and the configuration planner."
icra,None,Feedforward augmented sliding mode motion control of antagonistic soft pneumatic actuators,"Erik H. Skorina,Ming Luo,Selim Ozel,Fuchen Chen,Weijia Tao,,","Soft pneumatic actuators provide many exciting properties, but controlling them without the use of bulky and expensive flow-control valves can be difficult and computationally expensive. We seek a solution to this problem by introducing an inexpensive and reliable muscle-like linear soft actuator used antagonistically to operate a rigid 1-DoF joint, resulting in a system that combines the advantages of rigid and soft robotics. Using this setup, we performed precise motion control using a sliding mode feedback controller as well as a sliding mode controller augmented by a feedforward term to modulate the state of solenoid valves that drive each actuator. We found that both controllers performed equivalently well in following a step function and in responding to a disturbance. The feedforward augmented controller performed significantly better when following dynamic trajectories over a range of frequencies and with the addition of an external force. The next step will be to modify our valve control scheme to allow for the determination of both the position and stiffness of the joint, better leveraging the advantages of soft pneumatic actuators."
icra,None,Real-time control of soft-robots using asynchronous finite element modeling,"Frederick Largilliere,Valerian Verona,Eulalie Coevoet,Mario Sanz-Lopez,,,","Finite Element analysis can provide accurate deformable models for soft-robots. However, using such models is very difficult in a real-time system of control. In this paper, we introduce a generic solution that enables a high-rate control and that is compatible with strong real-time constraints. From a Finite Element analysis, computed at low rate, an inverse model of the robot outputs the setpoint values for the actuator in order to obtain a desired trajectory. This inverse problem uses a QP (quadratic-programming) algorithm based on the equations set by the Finite Element Method. To improve the update rate performances, we propose an asynchronous simulation framework that provides a better trade-off between the deformation accuracy and the computational burden. Complex computations such as accurate FEM deformations are done at low frequency while the control is performed at high frequency with strong real-time constraints. The two simulation loops (high frequency and low frequency loops) are mechanically coupled in order to guarantee mechanical accuracy of the system over time. Finally, the validity of the multi-rate simulation is discussed based on measurements of the evolution in the QP matrix and an experimental validation is conducted to validate the correctness of the high-rate inverse model on a real robot."

The combination of the two actuation mechanisms in this antagonistic robot structure is inspired by the octopus which uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles to steer, elongate, shrink and also stiffen its continuum arms. By “activating” its antagonistic muscle groups at the same time, the octopus can achieve multiple motion patterns as well as stiffen their arms. Being organized in a similar fashion, our robot manipulator uses, on the one hand, pneumatic actuation and, on the other hand, tendon-based actuation - one opposing the other, achieving an overall antagonistic actuation framework. Controlling the pressure inside the robot while at the same time controlling the tendons' displacements, the robot can be moved into a wide range of configurations while simultaneously controlling the arm's stiffness. This paper builds on earlier work by the authors: Here, we present a new conic-shaped manipulator structure and the control architecture. Using a constant curvature model, we have derived an approach suitable for controlling the robot manipulator. The manipulator's reachable workspace is analyzed and proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to show the robot's stiffness control and motion abilities."
icra,None,Design of robotic fingers with human-like passive parallel compliance,"Pei-Hsin Kuo,James DeBacker,Ashish D. Deshpande,","While human-like series passive compliance has been used in previous robotic hand designs, little attention has been paid to parallel passive compliance due to the lack of understanding of its importance in grasping and manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel design of compliant finger inspired by biomechanical features and functionality of human hands. We develop a human-like compact joint by optimizing the geometry of a compliant material and mechanical elements. The joint exhibits a passive double exponential torque matching human-like compliance. We implement the compliant joint into a robotic finger design with human-like tendon routings. We carry out a series of experiments on the finger design with an open-loop control strategy in grasping and manipulation. The results show that the fingers perform reliable grasping and manipulation without feedback. We validate the trajectory tracking with a motion capture system. The human-like compliant fingers follow the desired trajectories with small errors (less than 1 cm). The innovative finger design realizes the human-like hand passive properties and achieves human-like grasping capability."
icra,None,Wearable soft artificial skin for hand motion detection with embedded microfluidic strain sensing,"Jean-Baptiste Chossat,Yiwei Tao,Vincent Duchaine,Yong-Lae Park,","This paper describes the design and manufacturing of soft artificial skin with an array of embedded soft strain sensors for detecting various hand gestures by measuring joint motions of five fingers. The proposed skin was made of a hyperelastic elastomer material with embedded microchannels filled with two different liquid conductors, an ionic liquid and a liquid metal. The ionic liquid microchannels were used to detect the mechanical strain changes of the sensing material, and the liquid metal microchannels were used as flexible and stretchable electrical wires for connecting the sensors to an external control circuit. The two heterogeneous liquid conductors were electrically interfaced through flexible conductive threads to prevent the two liquid from being intermixed. The skin device was connected to a computer through a microcontroller instrumentation circuit for reconstructing the 3-D hand motions graphically. The paper also presents preliminary calibration and experimental results."
icra,None,Patterned compliance in robotic finger pads for versatile surface usage in dexterous manipulation,"Ian M. Bullock,Charlotte Guertler,Aaron M. Dollar,","The design of finger pads for robotic and prosthetic hands is often overlooked, with relatively simple shapes and mechanical properties typically used. The finger pad geometry and mechanical properties are especially important for within-hand dexterous manipulation, and human finger usage patterns suggest extending robotic finger pad usage onto side surfaces could enable a wider range of manipulation motion. In this work, we propose a novel finger pad design that combines a ridged stiff inner structure with air gaps and a flexible outer skin to facilitate both grasp stability and versatile usage of the finger surface. The air gaps enable objects to displace the outer skin and stably settle between two adjacent ridges. During manipulation, the ridges can also serve as predictable pivot points. Experimental results comparing three ridged finger designs to a conventional solid core design show that the ridged designs consistently outperform the reference solid core design for all objects, in terms of the ability to stably manipulate objects through a large motion range without ejection (losing grip on the object). Designs with larger spaces between ridges performed better overall than designs with closer spacing, showing that larger “wells” allow objects to more stably settle into the space between ridges. We anticipate the novel finger pad designs and the analysis of their behavior will inform future robotic hand designs, especially designs which aim to incorporate side finger usage."
icra,None,Towards high frequency actuation of SMA spring for the neurosurgical robot - MINIR-II,"Shing Shin Cheng,Jaydev P. Desai,","Robotic surgery, especially in the field of neurosurgery, can be tremendously improved with the integration of an excellent imaging modality during the procedure. Shape memory alloy (SMA), a high power density and inexpensive MRI-compatible actuator, is therefore being considered as an appropriate actuator for the robot. However, the low control bandwidth of SMA due to the long cooling time makes it undesirable for commercial use. An efficient and low-cost cooling method using water as a coolant that passes through a flexible tube coiled around the SMA spring is proposed to increase the cooling rate of SMA, thereby improving its actuation frequency. SMA constitutive model and heat transfer model have been developed to simulate theoretical behavior of SMA springs in antagonistic configuration. The maximum bandwidth we achieved was 0.333 Hz for tracking of a sinusoidal trajectory of 3 mm peak-to-peak magnitude. We also demonstrated the capability of our cooling system to control the motion of an SMA spring actuated one-DOF MINIR-II robot prototype."
icra,None,"Sparse Gaussian process regression for compliant, real-time robot control","Jens Schreiter,Peter Englert,Duy Nguyen-Tuong,Marc Toussaint,","Sparse Gaussian process (GP) models provide an efficient way to perform regression on large data sets. The key idea is to select a representative subset of the available training data, which induces the sparse GP model approximation. In the past, a variety of selection criteria for GP approximation have been proposed, but they either lack accuracy or suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel and straightforward criterion for successive selection of training points used for GP model approximation. The proposed algorithm allows a fast and efficient selection of training points, while being competitive in learning performance. As evaluation, we employ our approach in learning inverse dynamics models for robot control using very large data sets (e.g. 500.000 samples). It is demonstrated in experiments that our approximated GP model is sufficiently fast for real-time prediction in robot control. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art approximation techniques show that our proposed approach is significantly faster, while being competitive to generalization accuracy."
icra,None,High-level learning from demonstration with conceptual spaces and subspace clustering,"Richard Cubek,Wolfgang Ertel,Günther Palm,","Learning from demonstration (LfD) aims at robots learning skills from human-demonstrated tasks. Robots should be able to learn at all levels of abstraction. Unlike at the level of motor primitives, high-level LfD requires symbolic representations. It thus faces the classical problem of symbol grounding. Furthermore, it requires the robot to interpret human-demonstrated actions at a higher, conceptual abstraction level. We present a method, that enables a robot to recognize human-demonstrated pick-and-place task goals on an object-relational abstraction layer. The robot can reproduce the task goals in new situations using a symbolic planner. We show that in a robotic context conceptual spaces can serve as a mean for symbol grounding at an object-relational level as well as for the recognition of conceptual similarities in effects of human-demonstrated actions. The method is evaluated in experiments on a real robot."
icra,None,Active exploration of joint dependency structures,"Johannes Kulick,Stefan Otte,Marc Toussaint,","Being able to manipulate degrees of freedom of the environment, such as doors or drawers, is a requirement for most tasks a robot is supposed to perform. Often these external degrees of freedom depend on other ones, e.g., a drawer can only be opened if the lock is not locking the joint. We propose an approach to autonomously and efficiently explore and uncover joint dependency structures. We develop a probabilistic model for joint dependency structures which is the basis for active learning. Discontinuities in the dynamics of the joint, which often indicate key points of the joint, are used to segment the joint space into meaningful segments which then allows efficient exploration with the developed maximum cross-entropy (MaxCE) exploration strategy. Experiments in a simulated environment and on a real PR2 suggest that the proposed approach yields efficient exploration of joint dependency structures."
icra,None,Efficient reinforcement learning for robots using informative simulated priors,"Mark Cutler,Jonathan P. How,","Autonomous learning through interaction with the physical world is a promising approach to designing controllers and decision-making policies for robots. Unfortunately, learning on robots is often difficult due to the large number of samples needed for many learning algorithms. Simulators are one way to decrease the samples needed from the robot by incorporating prior knowledge of the dynamics into the learning algorithm. In this paper we present a novel method for transferring data from a simulator to a robot, using simulated data as a prior for real-world learning. A Bayesian nonparametric prior is learned from a potentially black-box simulator. The mean of this function is used as a prior for the Probabilistic Inference for Learning Control (PILCO) algorithm. The simulated prior improves the convergence rate and performance of PILCO by directing the policy search in areas of the state-space that have not yet been observed by the robot. Simulated and hardware results show the benefits of using the prior knowledge in the learning framework."
icra,None,Learning null space projections,"Hsiu-Chin Lin,Matthew Howard,Sethu Vijayakumar,","Many everyday human skills can be considered in terms of performing some task subject to a set of self-imposed or environmental constraints. In recent years, a number of new tools have become available in the learning and robotics community that allow data from constrained and/or redundant systems to be used to uncover underlying consistent behaviours that may be otherwise masked by the constraints. However, while a wide variety of work for generalisation of movements have been proposed, few have explicitly considered learning the constraints of the motion and ways to cope with unknown environment. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the constraints such that some previously learnt behaviours can be adapted to new environment in an appropriate way. In particular, we consider learning the null space projection matrix of a kinematically constrained system, and see how previously learnt policies can be adapted to novel constraints."
icra,None,Reducing hardware experiments for model learning and policy optimization,"Sehoon Ha,Katsu Yamane,","Conducting hardware experiment is often expensive in various aspects such as potential damage to the robot and the number of people required to operate the robot safely. Computer simulation is used in place of hardware in such cases, but it suffers from so-called simulation bias in which policies tuned in simulation do not work on hardware due to differences in the two systems. Model-free methods such as Q-Learning, on the other hand, do not require a model and therefore can avoid this issue. However, these methods typically require a large number of experiments, which may not be realistic for some tasks such as humanoid robot balancing and locomotion. This paper presents an iterative approach for learning hardware models and optimizing policies with as few hardware experiments as possible. Instead of learning the model from scratch, our method learns the difference between a simulation model and hardware. We then optimize the policy based on the learned model in simulation. The iterative approach allows us to collect wider range of data for model refinement while improving the policy."
icra,None,"Bottom-up learning of object categories, action effects and logical rules: From continuous manipulative exploration to symbolic planning","Emre Ugur,Justus Piater,","This work aims for bottom-up and autonomous development of symbolic planning operators from continuous interaction experience of a manipulator robot that explores the environment using its action repertoire. Development of the symbolic knowledge is achieved in two stages. In the first stage, the robot explores the environment by executing actions on single objects, forms effect and object categories, and gains the ability to predict the object/effect categories from the visual properties of the objects by learning the nonlinear and complex relations among them. In the next stage, with further interactions that involve stacking actions on pairs of objects, the system learns logical high-level rules that return a stacking-effect category given the categories of the involved objects and the discrete relations between them. Finally, these categories and rules are encoded in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), enabling symbolic planning. We realized our method by learning the categories and rules in a physics-based simulator. The learned symbols and operators are verified by generating and executing non-trivial symbolic plans on the real robot in a tower building task."
icra,None,Dense visual-inertial navigation system for mobile robots,"Sammy Omari,Michael Bloesch,Pascal Gohl,Roland Siegwart,","Real-time dense mapping and pose estimation is essential for a wide range of navigation tasks in mobile robotic applications. We propose an odometry and mapping system that leverages the full photometric information from a stereo-vision system as well as inertial measurements in a probabilistic framework while running in real-time on a single low-power Intel CPU core. Instead of performing mapping and localization on a set of sparse image features, we use the complete dense image intensity information in our navigation system. By incorporating a probabilistic model of the stereo sensor and the IMU, we can robustly estimate the ego-motion as well as a dense 3D model of the environment in real-time. The probabilistic formulation of the joint odometry estimation and mapping process enables to efficiently reject temporal outliers in ego-motion estimation as well as spatial outliers in the mapping process. To underline the versatility of the proposed navigation system, we evaluate it in a set of experiments on a multi-rotor system as well as on a quadrupedal walking robot. We tightly integrate our framework into the stabilization-loop of the UAV and the mapping framework of the walking robot. It is shown that the dense framework exhibits good tracking and mapping performance in terms of accuracy as well as robustness in scenarios with highly dynamic motion patterns while retaining a relatively small computational footprint. This makes it an ideal candidate for control and navigation tasks in unstructured GPS-denied environments, for a wide range of robotic platforms with power and weight constraints. The proposed framework is released as an open-source ROS package."
icra,None,Learning driving styles for autonomous vehicles from demonstration,"Markus Kuderer,Shilpa Gulati,Wolfram Burgard,","It is expected that autonomous vehicles capable of driving without human supervision will be released to market within the next decade. For user acceptance, such vehicles should not only be safe and reliable, they should also provide a comfortable user experience. However, individual perception of comfort may vary considerably among users. Whereas some users might prefer sporty driving with high accelerations, others might prefer a more relaxed style. Typically, a large number of parameters such as acceleration profiles, distances to other cars, speed during lane changes, etc., characterize a human driver's style. Manual tuning of these parameters may be a tedious and error-prone task. Therefore, we propose a learning from demonstration approach that allows the user to simply demonstrate the desired style by driving the car manually. We model the individual style in terms of a cost function and use feature-based inverse reinforcement learning to find the model parameters that fit the observed style best. Once the model has been learned, it can be used to efficiently compute trajectories for the vehicle in autonomous mode. We show that our approach is capable of learning cost functions and reproducing different driving styles using data from real drivers."
icra,None,Model-based 3D object recognition and fetching by a 7-DoF robot with online obstacle avoidance for factory automation,"Ren C. Luo,Chia-Wen Kuo,Yi-Ting Chung,","The objective of this paper is to present the model-based 3D object recognition and fetching by a 7-DoF robot with online obstacle avoidance for factory automation. The robot can fetch the random type of 3D objects with arbitrary pose using a 3D visual camera. Object recognition pipeline based on different descriptors are compared in order to decide the best choice for this scenario. A correct grasp is taught by human operator using programming by touch. As a result, the time of configuring and setting up the robot drastically decreases and thus saves a large amount of preparation time before the robot can actually get to work. Considering the safety issue of the human operators that cooperate with the robot, as well as the uncertainty of the environment such that a moving obstacle might present, or the environment might change for some reason, an online obstacle avoidance algorithm is also integrated into the system. Experimental proof of principles has been successfully implemented."
icra,None,Robotic simulation of dynamic plume tracking by Unmanned Surface Vessels,"Muhammad Fahad,Nathaniel Saul,Yi Guo,Brian Bingham,","Using autonomous mobile robots to dynamically track oil plume propagation in ocean environments is challenging. Based on a model of advection-diffusion equation that describes point-source pollution propagation in marine environments, we have previously proposed a model-based estimator-controller design for autonomous robots to dynamically track plume front propagation. In this paper we study the robustness of the controller in a robot simulator, and evaluate it's performance in a realistic environmental model setup. A probabilistic Lagrangian environmental model is used that can capture both the time-averaged, idealized structure and the instantaneous, realistic structure of a dynamic plume. The controller is implemented on the Field Robotics Lab Vehicle Software, which uses Lightweight Communication and Marshalling library to facilitate process communication and for easy transit to field testing. Simulation results are shown with discussions and lessons learned to guide future field experiments."
icra,None,Evaluation of a direct optimization method for trajectory planning of a 9-DOF redundant fruit-picking manipulator,"Christoph Schuetz,Joerg Baur,Julian Pfaff,Thomas Buschmann,,","Selective tasks such as harvesting or spraying of single crops are a promising research topic in agricultural automation. Inspired by industrial production, an obvious approach is to use robot manipulators in greenhouses and orchards. To exploit the potential of redundant manipulators in particular, advanced motion planning algorithms are needed. While harvesting, a new trajectory for every fruit has to be planned. Although the scenario is similar for every fruit, it is unique for each harvesting sequence. In this paper we present an efficient online planning approach which takes advantage of a simplified environment model. However, the generated trajectory is not optimal in general w.r.t. joint velocities or might even be unfeasible. Thus, we introduce an optional global offline optimization scheme which is able to find optimal trajectories in a few seconds and takes advantage of the heuristic planning as initial guess. We apply the proposed scheme to a 9-DOF agricultural manipulator for sweet-pepper harvesting and evaluate our method by extensive tests with fruit positions based on real measurements."
icra,None,Automated micro-aspiration of mouse embryo limb bud tissue,"Jun Wen,Jun Liu,Kimberly Lau,Haijiao Liu,Sevan Hopyan,Yu Sun,","Mechanical force is an integral part of tissue morphogenesis and patterning. We have developed an automated micro-aspiration system to investigate how mouse limb bud tissue responds to extrinsic forces in order to understand whether tissue-generated forces can be a part of the mechanism causing oriented cell behaviors observed in mouse limb bud morphogenesis. The system is capable of performing automated micropipette tracking, tissue-tip contact detection, pressure control, and prolonged application of constant pressure. A three-dimensional tissue tracking algorithm is developed based on the processing of time-lapsed confocal Z-stack images. 3D visual feedback from confocal microscopy imaging, for the first time, is used to realize 3D visual servoing to control the micropipette position to compensate for tissue movement. This enables stable force application in a biologically relevant time scale (e.g., 60 minutes) during which cell remodeling occurs. Experimental results demonstrate that micro-aspiration on mouse limb bud is capable of creating tension anisotropy which causes force-responsive cells to dynamically remodel through polarized cell division and rosette resolution."
icra,None,Inversion-free feedforward dynamic compensation of hysteresis nonlinearities in piezoelectric micro/nano-positioning actuators,"Omar Aljanaideh,Mohammad Al Janaideh,Micky Rakotondrabe,","A new methodology that employs the rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model (RDPI) as a model and a compensator is suggested in this study for modeling and compensation of rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezoelectric actuator. The technique employs a restructuration of the model that ignores the need to derive an inverse model, which avoids the additional calculations required to formulate a compensator. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy on modeling and compensation of hysteresis nonlinearities at various frequencies. The simulation results were followed by experimental study on a piezoelectric actuator that exhibits rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be employed effectively for compensation of rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities without developing an inverse model."
icra,None,Electroplated nickel microspring and low-friction precision linear slider: A novel micro-force sensing tool,"Pooya Saketi,Peihua Wangyang,Haihua Li,Qingkang Wang,Pasi Kallio,","This paper introduces a novel micro-force sensing approach utilizing an electroplated nickel microspring and a precision linear slider (PLS) for micro-tensile testing applications. After investigating the effects of friction forces in a PLS, an electroplated nickel microspring is designed, fabricated and integrated into the PLS, and the proposed micro-force sensor concept is validated through experimental results. The microspring fabricated in this paper is limited to forces up to 6 mN with the average sensitivity of 36.63 μN/μm. It is shown that the friction forces introduce uncertainties only to the forces less than 500 μN. The proposed approach allows the fabrication of micro-force sensors for the force ranges of up to tens of Millinewtons for different applications."
icra,None,Automated robotic vitrification of embryos,"Jun Liu,Chaoyang Shi,Jun Wen,Derek Pyne,Haijiao Liu,Changhai Ru,,","This paper reports the first robotic system for vitrification of mammalian embryos. Vitrification is a technique for preserving oocytes and embryos in clinical IVF (in vitro fertilization). The procedure involves multiple steps of stringently timed pick-and-place operation for processing an oocyte/embryo in vitrification media. In IVF clinics, vitrification is conducted manually by highly skilled embryologists. Processing one oocyte/embryo occupies the embryologist 15–20 minutes, depending on protocols chosen to implement. Due to poor reproducibility and inconsistency across operators, success rates and survival rates also vary significantly. Through collaboration with IVF clinics, we are in process to realize robotic vitrification and aim ultimately to standardize clinical vitrification from manual operation to fully automated robotic operation. Our robotic system is embedded with two contact detection methods to determine the relative Z positions of the vitrification micropipette, embryo, and vitrification straw. A 3D tracking algorithm is developed for visually servoed embryo transfer and real-time monitoring of embryo volume changes during vitrification. Excess medium is automatically removed from around the vitrified embryo on the vitrification straw to achieve a high cooling rate. Tests on mouse embryos demonstrate that the system is capable of performing vitrification with a throughput at least three times that of manual operation and achieved a high survival rate (88.9%) and development rate (93.8%)."

The proposed system can be used to overcome current limitations of conventional pump systems for microfluidic devices.
icra,None,Three-dimensional magnetic assembly of alginate microfibers using microfluidic “printing” method,"Tao Sun,Qiang Huang,Qing Shi,Huaping Wang,Masahiro Nakajima,,","Due to the poor controllability in hydrogels, Hydrogels-based assembly to form larger 3D complex shapes is still a big challenge. In this paper, we have reported a novel “bottom-up” method to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) magnetic alginate microfibers (MAMs) assemblies with complex shapes. Specifically, Alginate microfibers encapsulating Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNs) and fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) have been spun using microfluidic method with “pinch-off” scheme. Experimental results show that the MAMs can respond quickly to the magnetic field, enabling their enhanced controllability. The magnetic assembly system is constructed by PDMS microfluidic device, 3D supporting model adhered on the bottom surface of dish filled with deionized water and magnet. The microfluidic “printing“ and magnetic deposition in magnetic assembly process are experimentally demonstrated, respectively. Because of magnetic field, the complex assembly shapes can be fabricated just by moving the microfluidic device in a plane. To match well with the shape of supporting model and to keep a stable assembly structure, the secondary cross-linking method is employed. From the LIVE/DEAD assay, cells can survive well during the magnetic assembly process."

icra,None,Kinematic analysis and design considerations for optimal base frame arrangement of humanoid shoulders,"Mostafa Bagheri,Arash Ajoudani,Jinoh Lee,Darwin G. Caldwell,,","It is well known that kinematics can significantly affect the manipulation capabilities of robotic arms, traditionally illustrated by performance indices such as workspace volume, kinematic and force manipulability, and isotropy within the arm workspace. In the case of dual-arm systems and bimanual manipulation tasks, the kinematics effects to the above indices becomes even more apparent. However, in spite of the large number of dual-arm systems developed in the past, there is a little literature on the kinematic design analysis for the development of such systems. Particularly, the effects of configuration/ orientation of the shoulders' placement with respect to the torso structure have not sufficiently studied or considered, while many dual-arm systems with upward and/or forward tilt angle in shoulder base frame have been introduced. This paper addresses this problem and quantifies the effect of shoulders base frame orientation in a dual-arm manipulation system by looking at its effect on several important manipulation indices, such as the overall and common workspace, redundancy, global isotropy, dual-arm manipulability, and inertia ellipsoid index within the common workspace of the two arms. Consequently, a range of upward and forward tilt angles for the shoulder frames is identified for the design of a dual-arm torso system to render the most desired manipulation performance."
icra,None,Mechanism and control of robotic arm using rotational counterweights,"Akihiro Kawamura,Byunghyun Gang,Mitsunori Uemura,Sadao Kawamura,","This paper proposes an actuation mechanism of robotic arms using rotational counterweights. The robotic arm is driven by gravitational and inertia forces of the counterweight mounted on links. The joints of the robotic arms are able to rotate freely though this robot does not have any actuators on joints. Thereby, the robot has high joint flexibility. Additionally, the counterweight system reduces the moment applied to base link caused by gravity effect since the posture of the arm keeps a gravitational equilibrium state statically. Therefore, it is expected that the robotic arm is utilized in narrow and high altitude environment or on small vehicles. This paper also proposes a control method of the new robotic arm. The control method realizes precise position control of joint angle. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments using a prototype."
icra,None,A novel method for measuring the coupled linear and angular motions of XYΘ-type flexure-based manipulators,"Yanding Qin,Xin Zhao,","For XYΘ-type flexure-based manipulators with nanometer accuracy, the coupled linear/angular motions of the end effector cause unwanted misalignments to the measurement system, leading to measurement error or even measurement failure. This paper proposes an indirect measuring method for such manipulators, where the 3-PRR topology is adopted to kinematically transfer the coupled motions of the end effector to the linear motions of three prismatic joints. Unlike the other XYΘ manipulators, three linear position sensors are used to measure the linear motions of the prismatic joints, not the coupled motions of the end effector. Accordingly, the position and orientation of the end effector can be obtained via the forward kinematics. This indirect method aims to eliminate the influence of the coupled motions of the end effector on the measurement system, and to guarantee the accuracies and effectiveness of the sensors' outputs. An XYΘ flexure-based manipulator is developed following this method. The design and kinematics modeling is presented, and the effectiveness of this method is computationally verified. The future work will focus on the experimental verification of this method."

We argue that the relatively larger inaccuracies shown by absolute sensors can be compensated by suitable processing, such as a passive complementary filters exploiting the Mahony-Hamel formulation. The proposed method is applicable to systems where measurements of relative angles is not feasible or convenient, or where the joint kinematics are not lower pairs: for example, human body parts or soft robotic devices. In the paper, we make explicit reference to the reconstruction of posture of the compliant, underactuated Pisa/IIT SoftHand. Quantitative comparisons with ground truth data in grasping tests are used to validate the proposed method. The resulting hardware design is mechanically robust, cheap and can be easily adapted to robotic hands with different structures, as well as to sensorizing gloves for studying human grasping strategies."

The twisted string actuation system is particularly suitable for very compact and light-weight robotic devices, like artificial limbs, exoskeletons and robotic hands, since it renders a very low apparent inertia at the load side, allowing the implementation of powerful tendon-based driving systems, using as actuators small-size DC motors characterized by high speed, low torque and very limited inertia. The basic properties of the twisted string actuation system are firstly presented, and the way how they are exploited for the implementation of a variable stiffness joint is discussed. A simple control algorithm for controlling the joint stiffness and position simultaneously is discussed, and a the feedback linearization of the device is taken into account and validated in simulation."

The main feature of the algorithm is to ease robot programming, shifting from an imperative paradigm, in which task constraints are semantically and uniquely mapped into a suitable end-effector velocity profile, towards a declarative motion programming, where such constraints are turned by the controller into motion commands only at run-time: The system embeds the capability of handling real-time events, such as updated sensor readings, with reduced pre-programmed control logics. An experimental case study based on a 7-DOF robot demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach."
icra,None,Power analysis of a series elastic actuator for ankle joint gait rehabilitation,"Oussama Ben Farah,Zhao Guo,Chen Gong,Chi Zhu,Haoyong Yu,","Series elastic actuator (SEA) has been widely used in rehabilitation robotics, where human-robot interaction is required. Due to its intrinsic compliance, SEA can improve the usage of power for its motor, which leads to a compact and lightweight SEA design. The aim of this paper is to reduce the energy consumption and the power requirements of the motor of the SEA by optimizing the stiffness of its spring. This study is inspired by the biomechanics of a human ankle joint, which stores elastic energy during the first phases of the walking process and releases the stored energy in the next gait phases to propel the human body forward. Power analysis and optimization procedure are conducted on complete SEA models with different complexity, including inertia, damping and stiffness, and with open loop and closed loop control strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that a reduction of 56.6% of the peak motor power can be achieved with the optimized spring stiffness."
icra,None,Predictive exploration considering previously mapped environments,"Daniel Perea Ström,Fabrizio Nenci,Cyrill Stachniss,","The ability to explore an unknown environment is an important prerequisite for building truly autonomous robots. The central decision that a robot needs to make when exploring an unknown environment is to select the next view point(s) for gathering observations. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to select view points that support the underlying mapping process. We propose a novel approach that makes predictions about the structure of the environments in the unexplored areas by relying on maps acquired previously. Our approach seeks to find similarities between the current surroundings of the robot and previously acquired maps stored in a database in order to predict how the environment may expand in the unknown areas. This allows us to predict potential future loop closures early. This knowledge is used in the view point selection to actively close loops and in this way reduce the uncertainty in the robot's belief. We implemented and tested the proposed approach.

However, when revisiting places over and over, many state-of-the-art approaches exhibit reduced performance in terms of computation and memory complexity and in terms of accuracy. For successful deployment of robots over long time scales, we must develop algorithms that get better with repeated visits to the same environment, while still working within a fixed computational budget. This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that alternates between online place recognition and offline map maintenance with the goal of producing the best performance with a fixed map size. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map, we use a scoring function that ranks the utility of each landmark and a sampling policy that selects the landmarks for each place. The Summary Map can then be used by any descriptor-based inference method for constant-complexity online place recognition. We evaluate a number of scoring functions and sampling policies and show that it is possible to build and maintain maps of a constant size and that place-recognition performance improves over multiple visits."
icra,None,Efficient and effective matching of image sequences under substantial appearance changes exploiting GPS priors,"Olga Vysotska,Tayyab Naseer,Luciano Spinello,Wolfram Burgard,,",The ability to localize a robot is an important capability and matching of observations under substantial changes is a prerequisite for robust long-term operation. This paper investigates the problem of efficiently coping with seasonal changes in image data. We present an extension of a recent approach [15] to visual image matching using sequence information. Our extension allows for exploiting GPS priors in the matching process to overcome the main computational bottleneck of the previous method and to handle loops within the image sequences. We present an experimental evaluation using real world data containing substantial seasonal changes and show that our approach outperforms the previous method in case a noisy GPS pose prior is available.
icra,None,LexTOR: Lexicographic teach optimize and repeat based on user preferences,"Mladen Mazuran,Christoph Sprunk,Wolfram Burgard,Gian Diego Tipaldi,","In the last years, many researchers started to consider teach-and-repeat approaches for reliable autonomous navigation. The paradigm, in all its proposed forms, is deeply rooted in the idea that the robot should autonomously follow a route that has been demonstrated by a human during a teach phase. However, human demonstrations are often inefficient in terms of execution time or may cause premature wear of the robot components due to jittery behavior or strong accelerations. In this paper, we propose the concept of teach, optimize and repeat, which introduces a trajectory optimization step between the teach and repeat phases. To address this problem, we further propose LexTOR, a constrained trajectory optimization method for teach and repeat problems, where the constraints are defined according to user preferences. At its core, LexTOR optimizes both the execution time and the trajectory smoothness in a lexicographic sense. The experiments show that LexTOR is very effective, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in terms of execution time, smoothness, accuracy and bound satisfaction."

Savatier,","In this paper, we propose a car positioning approach that does not rely on GPS. We propose to use car wheel speeds and road maps in order to achieve robust positioning of the vehicle. The vehicle positioning is achieved by applying particle filtering on a graph-based representation of a road map. We show that the vehicle positioning is feasible and robust with these two inputs at a really low computational cost. We achieve car positioning with an averaged 5 m accuracy within a 100 km drivable road map on a 12 km sequence."
icra,None,Curb feature based localization of a mobile robot in urban road environments,"Hyunsuk Lee,Jooyoung Park,Woojin Chung,","Urban road environments that have pavement and curb are characterized as semi-structured road environments. In semi-structured road environments, the curb provides useful information for robot navigation. In this paper, we present a practical localization method for outdoor mobile robots using the curb features in semi-structured road environments. The curb features are especially useful in urban environment, where the GPS failures take place frequently. A curb extraction is conducted on the basis of the Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) to minimize false detection. We adopt the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to combine the curb information with odometry and Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). The uncertainty models for the sensors are quantitatively analyzed to provide a practical solution."
icra,None,Asynchronous blind signal decomposition using tiny-length code for Visible Light Communication-based indoor localization,"Fangyi Zhang,Kejie Qiu,Ming Liu,","Indoor localization is a fundamental capability for service robots and indoor applications on mobile devices. To realize that, the cost and performance are of great concern. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight signal encoding and decomposition method for a low-cost and low-power Visible Light Communication (VLC)-based indoor localization system. Firstly, a Gold-sequence-based tiny-length code selection method is introduced for light encoding. Then a correlation-based asynchronous blind light-signal decomposition method is developed for the decomposition of the lights mixed with modulated light sources. It is able to decompose the mixed light-signal package in real-time. The average decomposition time-cost for each frame is 20 ms. By using the decomposition results, the localization system achieves accuracy at 0.56 m. These features outperform other existing low-cost indoor localization approaches, such as WiFiSLAM."
icra,None,Distributed map fusion with sporadic updates for large domains,"Peter C. Niedfeldt,Alberto Speranzon,Amit Surana,","Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms allow a single robot to reduce the effects of drifting sensor biases while exploring unknown, GPS-denied environments. To reduce exploration time, a team of robots can build smaller maps in parallel and perform map fusion. Most map fusion techniques require a known relative transformation between coordinate frames. Other techniques rely on inter-robot detections to estimate an initial transformation. However, large environments with sparse robot coverage may necessitate alternative techniques when robots are in communication, but not, sensor range. In this paper, we address the map fusion problem with unknown relative transformations between robot pairs. We use the probabilistic hypothesis density (PHD) SLAM algorithm to track features within a static, simulated environment and propose two techniques for distributed map matching: a RANSAC based congruent triangle matching algorithm and an earth mover's distance (EMD) based assignment algorithm."
icra,None,Fast LIDAR localization using multiresolution Gaussian mixture maps,"Ryan W. Wolcott,Ryan M. Eustice,","This paper reports on a fast multiresolution scan matcher for vehicle localization in urban environments for self-driving cars. State-of-the-art approaches to vehicle localization rely on observing road surface reflectivity with a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. However, these approaches can often fail when faced with adverse weather conditions that obscure the view of the road paint (e.g., puddles and snowdrifts) or poor road surface texture. We propose a new scan matching algorithm that leverages Gaussian mixture maps to exploit the structure in the environment; these maps are a collection of Gaussian mixtures over the z-height distribution. We achieve real-time performance by developing a novel branch-and-bound, multiresolution approach that makes use of rasterized lookup tables of these Gaussian mixtures. Results are shown on two datasets that are 3.0 km: a standard trajectory and another under adverse weather conditions."
icra,None,Experimental evaluation of gripping characteristics based on frictional theory for ground grip locomotive robot on an asteroid,"Yudai Yuguchi,Warley F. R. Ribeiro,Kenji Nagaoka,Kazuya Yoshida,","Owing to the irregular terrain and microgravity environment of an asteroid, an appropriate locomotion mechanism is required for exploring the asteroid by a robot. In this paper, a ground grip locomotive robot is proposed. One of the most important requirements of the robot is the development of the finger gripping mechanism that can be attached on an uneven surface. To meet this requirement, grip condition and friction characteristics between the finger and the surface need to be understood. Therefore, we conducted an experimental evaluation of gripping characteristics by measuring the coefficients of friction between several types of fingers and simulated grounds. Moreover, the range of possible gripping angles for simulated ground was determined by conditional equations and confirmed by an experiment of gripping the ground using an air-floating system. In this paper, conical shape is shown to be effective for ground grip locomotive robot."
icra,None,Scaling controllable adhesives to grapple floating objects in space,"Hao Jiang,Elliot W. Hawkes,Vladimir Arutyunov,Jacob Tims,Christine Fuller,,,,,,","As the number of rocket bodies and other debris in Earth's orbit increases, the need to capture and remove this space junk becomes essential to protect new satellites. A low cost solution may include gecko-inspired directional adhesives, which require almost no compressive preload to generate adhesion and are therefore suitable for surface grasping in space where objects are free floating. Current individual adhesive units with a pair of opposed pads achieve a limit of 13N normal to the surface. Instead of using a single large unit to generate high levels of adhesion, using multiple small gripper units is desirable to prevent single-point failures and to conform to higher curvatures. For this strategy to succeed, it is essential to distribute the overall force evenly, to minimize the overall preload normal to the surface, and to prevent local failures from propagating over the array. We present two load sharing mechanisms. The first uses nearly-constant force springs in parallel. The second uses a tendon and pulleys in series. Both allow a 4-unit gripper to maintain the same adhesive stress as a single unit. A normal adhesive load to compressive preload ratio of 100:1 is demonstrated. Zero gravity experiments and air bearing floor experiments demonstrate the gripper's functionality in a simulated space environment. Design considerations are discussed for further scaling, with the trade-offs among load sharing, suitability for different surfaces, and failure sensitivity."
icra,None,On some practical reactionless motion tasks with a free-floating space robot,"Hiroki Sone,Dragomir N. Nenchev,","This work describes how to use reactionless motion control with a free-floating space robot, suggesting thereby some tasks of practical importance. We show that the reactionless motion capability is directly affected by the kinematic structure of the manipulator, depending thereby upon the existence of kinematic redundancy, a typical lower/upper arm subchain and joint offsets. We investigate a seven-DoF redundant manipulator comprising these features and show that approximate reactionless motions can be obtained with the elbow joint only and/or the wrist joints. Using these reactionless motions, we propose three practical maneuvers for eye-in-hand type inspection, arm deploying/stowing and point-to-point motions with partial reactionless motion. Feasibility is verified via numerical simulations."
icra,None,A new actuator for on-orbit inspection,"Benjamin Reinhardt,Mason Peck,","Can you move along a surface in space without propellant or mechanical contact? This paper presents a new actuator, the induction coupler, which generates an eddy-current force between a robotic inspector and the conductive exterior of its target. This force allows the inspector to crawl along the surface of a target without mechanical contact. Sets of induction couplers composed of spinning arrays of permanent magnets can exert control force and torque in all six rigid-body degrees of freedom by strategically repelling and shearing across the surface of the target. This paper uses an analytical model of eddy-current forces to simulate the set of maneuvers necessary to produce the control force and torque that can move and orient a robotic orbital inspector. Experiments on a low-friction test bed demonstrate a successful implementation of the actuator and verify the feasibility of this approach."
icra,None,Comparison of an attitude estimator based on the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle with some state-of-the-art filters,"Maziar Izadi,Ehsan Samiei,Amit K. Sanyal,Vijay Kumar,","Discrete-time estimation of rigid body attitude and angular velocity without any knowledge of the attitude dynamics model, is treated using the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. Using body-fixed sensor measurements of direction vectors and angular velocity, a Lagrangian is obtained as the difference between a kinetic energy-like term that is quadratic in the angular velocity estimation error, and an artificial potential obtained from Wahba's function. An additional dissipation term that depends linearly on the angular velocity estimation error is introduced, and the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle is applied to the Lagrangian with this dissipation. An implicit and an explicit first-order version of this discrete-time estimation scheme is presented. A comparison of this estimator is made with certain state-of-the-art attitude estimators in the absence of bias in sensor readings. Numerical simulations show that this estimator is robust and unlike extended Kalman filter-based schemes, its convergence does not depend on the gain values. In addition, the variational estimator is found to be more computationally efficient than these other estimators."

The servicer navigates to the client with the intention of manipulating it, using a robotic arm. Within this framework, this work presents a new robotic experimental facility which was recently built at the DLR to support the development and experimental validation of such orbital servicing robots. The facility allows reproducing a close-proximity scenario under realistic three-dimensional orbital dynamics conditions. Its salient features are described here, to include a fully actuated macro-micro system with multiple sensing capabilities, and analyses on its performance including the amount of space environment volume that can be simulated."

In this work, we present an automatic estimation method for the shape and motion of an asteroid, which is planned to be tested in future exploration missions including Japanese Hayabusa-2 [1]. Our task is to estimate the shape and rotation axis of the asteroid, as well as positions of the spacecraft from optical images. The proposed method is based on the expectation conditional-maximization (ECM) framework that consists of an auxiliary particle filter and nonlinear optimization techniques. One of our technical contributions is the estimation of the direction of rotation axis of the asteroid from monocular camera images, which are taken by the moving spacecraft. We conducted two experiments with synthetic data and an asteroid mock-up to show the validity of the proposed method and to present the numerical accuracy."

The current SUPERball is the first full prototype of this tensegrity robot platform, eventually destined for space exploration missions. This work, building on prior published discussions of individual components, presents the fully-constructed robot. Various design improvements are discussed, as well as testing results of the sensors and actuators that illustrate system performance. Basic low-level motor position controls are implemented and validated against sensor data, which show SUPERball to be uniquely suited for highly dynamic state trajectory tracking. Finally, SUPERball is shown in a simple example of locomotion. This implementation of a basic motion primitive shows SUPERball in untethered control."
icra,None,Towards orbital based global rover localization,"Evangelos Boukas,Antonios Gasteratos,Gianfranco Visentin,","Space exploratory rovers do well in autonomous or composite semi-autonomous exploration of extraterrestrial surfaces, yet their localization relies on the particular spot they had landed, rather than being universal, i.e. based on the absolute coordinate system of the explored planet. The idea underlaying the work presented in this paper is the transition from the relative to absolute localization by inspecting common Regions of Interest (ROIs) on both rover and orbital imagery. In order to achieve that we propose a method comprising an offline and an onboard procedure. Particularly, prior to the mission the orbital images of the intended landing area are examined to extract ROIs and to construct an offline Global Network (GN). The onboard procedure is based on the rover's self localization which is performed via an inertial aided visual odometry (VO). During its roaming the rover extracts ROIs from the ground and forms a Local Network (LN). The last is iteratively matched with the GN by a specifically designed matching procedure based on Data-Aligned Rigidity-Constrained Exhaustive Search (DARCES). The proposed method is tested on real representative data collected during the ESA Seeker activity. The results indicate that the self-localization of a planetary rover in an absolute frame of reference is feasible, provided that the area includes few discriminative ROIs."

With our framework, the robot can interact with the environment, or assist its user. The low frequency and accuracy of the BCI commands is compensated by vision tools, such as objects recognition and mapping techniques, as well as shared-control approaches. As a result, the proposed framework offers intuitive, safe, and accurate robot navigation towards an object or a person. The generic aspect of the framework is demonstrated by two complex experiments, where the user controls the robot to serve him a drink, and to raise his own arm."

The approach applies established algorithms for point cloud processing and filtering to data from a low-cost, structured light sensor. A patient's volume is estimated on the basis of their visible front surface.

icra,None,Optimal needle grasp selection for automatic execution of suturing tasks in robotic minimally invasive surgery,"Taoming Liu,M. Cenk Çavuşoğlu,","This paper presents algorithms for optimal selection of needle grasp, for autonomous robotic execution of the minimally invasive surgical suturing task. In order to minimize the tissue trauma during the suturing motion, the best practices of needle path planning that are used by surgeons are applied for autonomous robotic surgical suturing tasks. Once an optimal needle trajectory in a well-defined suturing scenario is chosen, another critical issue for suturing is the choice of needle grasp for the robotic system. Inappropriate needle grasp increases operating time requiring multiple regrasps to complete the desired task. The proposed methods use manipulability, dexterity and torque metrics for needle grasp selection. A simulation demonstrates the proposed methods and recommends a variety of grasps. Then a realistic demonstration compares the performances of the manipulator using different grasps."

An example of such project is STIFF-FLOP, which aims to develop a soft silicone manipulator actuated by pressure. The current arm construction and method of actuation cause several undesirable effects, which pose problems for actuation and sensing. In this paper, the authors identify the source of those negative effects and propose improvements over the current construction to eliminate or limit their influence. The new construction concept is tested and compared with the current one. Possible ideas for further development are also proposed."

However, as for the patients suffering from mandibular mobility disorders, their mandible functions are deteriorated, which severely affects their quality of life. In this paper, we present a new solution to recover mandibular mobility: a soft oral rehabilitation robot (SORR), which is actuated by a novel type of soft pneumatic actuator (SPA). After identifying the biometrics of the human mandible, we illustrate the application-oriented design of the robot and the SPA. A static model of the SPA was established to predict its behavior and eligibility for the application. In the experimental characterization, we measured the elongation and force output of the SPA, and the detailed results are presented. The comparison and analysis of the results provide physical insight into the mechanisms of the SPA. As the first application of soft robot inside human body, this work enlightens profound application potentials of the silicone-based SPAs."

The robotic glove leverages soft material actuator technology to safely distribute forces along the length of the finger and provide active flexion and passive extension. These actuators consist of molded elastomeric bladders with anisotropic fiber reinforcements that produce specific bending, twisting, and extending trajectories upon fluid pressurization. In particular, we present a method for customizing a soft actuator to a wearer's biomechanics and demonstrate in a motion capture system that the ranges of motion (ROM) of the two are nearly equivalent. The active ROM of the glove is further evaluated using the Kapandji test. Lastly, in a case study, we present preliminary results of a patient with very weak hand strength performing a timed Box-and-Block test with and without the soft robotic glove."
icra,None,A proposal of a light-weight walking assist wear using PVC gel artificial muscles,"Yi Li,Minoru Hashimoto,","We have developed a contraction and expansion-type artificial muscle by using the plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel and mesh electrodes. The PVC gel artificial muscle exhibits a fast response in air, large deformation, variable stiffness, high output force and low power consumption under an electrical field, so it has a great potential to use as a new type of artificial muscles. In a previous study, we designed variable stiffness spats for walking assistance by incorporating the variable stiffness PVC gel artificial muscles with the generally used spats. The spats can assist walking by the generation force of the variation of stiffness with the on and off switching of an electric field. It was found that both the integrated electromyogram (IEMG) and maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) of the rectus femoris muscle decreased during the walking when wearing the variable stiffness gel spats which showed that it was possible to use the PVC gel artificial muscles for walking assistance. However, the variable stiffness spats has small generation force and lower robustness to external forces. In this study, we propose a novel approach to make a high-performance light-weight walking assist wear using the PVC gel artificial muscles. We use the contraction-expansion output force for motion assist to get a bigger generation force. An expansion type structure unit is introduced to make the assist wear more robust to external forces. Insole force sensors are used to detect the gait changes during walking. The proposed walking assist wear has the characteristics of a simple structure, light weight, easy to put on and take off and with a high flexibility. In this paper, the framework involving the proposed walking assist wear is described in detail."
icra,None,A pressure-redistributing insole using soft sensors and actuators,"J.H. Low,P.M. Khin,C.H. Yeow,","Soft robotics has garnered great research interest from robotics community due to their compliant control as compared to normal hard rigid robots. Particularly, these soft actuators only involve simple design of pneumatic channels to generate required actuation and are usually powered by pneumatics or hydraulics. These actuators are usually lightweight, inexpensive and easily fabricated with soft lithography technique. In this paper, we present a different application of soft robotics in shoe insole design that involves simple design and control. To our knowledge, this is the first study to design soft sensors and actuators which aim to redistribute the plantar pressure and eventually tackle foot problems such as ulcers and blisters. The abnormal, high repetitive stresses acting on the foot tissues can cause immediate breakdown of foot tissues, which will lead to ulcers and even a serious pathology that require foot amputation. A mold with a peripheral pneumatic ring channel feature was designed using computer-aided drawing and thereafter 3D-printed. Subsequently, elastomeric material was poured into the mold and cured to create a negative replica of the mold, which is then sealed using another 2mm layer of elastomeric material. Upon pressurization, the pneumatic channel embedded in the actuator will inflate in the regions that are most compliant and cushion the plantar soft tissues as well as reduce the peak plantar pressure."
icra,None,A dynamically consistent hierarchical control architecture for robotic-assisted tele-echography with motion and contact dynamics driven by a 3D time-of-flight camera and a force sensor,"Luís Santos,Rui Cortesão,","This paper discusses a new control approach for robotic-assisted tele-echography where contact dynamics are driven by a 3D time-of-flight camera and a force sensor. Based on 3D camera and force data, contact stiffness is anticipated, allowing adaptation before contact. This approach enables to slow down robot dynamics before contact which is adequate for tele-echographic tasks. Additionally, free space inertial forces can also be eliminated from the control loop. In contact, environment stiffness is estimated online using only force data. The control architecture features a dynamically consistent hierarchical approach, where an explicit Cartesian force control arises as the primary task while orientation control is designed in the null space. Control performance is boosted by Kalman active observers (AOBs). Experiments with a 7-DOF WAM™ validate the architecture, where an ultrasound probe is teleoperated in 6 Cartesian dimensions, executing typical echographic tasks."
icra,None,Plan folding motion for rigid self-folding machine via discrete domain sampling,"Zhonghua Xi,Jyh-Ming Lien,","Self-folding robot is usually modeled as rigid origami, a class of origami whose entire surface remains rigid during folding except at crease lines. In this work, we focus on finding valid folding motion that brings the origami from the unfolded state continuously to the folded state. Although recent computational methods allow rapid simulation of folding process of certain rigid origami, these methods can fail even when the input crease pattern is extremely simple but requires implicit folding orders. Moreover, due to the rigidity requirement, the probability of generating a valid configuration via uniform sampling is zero, which greatly hinders the applicability of traditional sampling-based motion planners. We propose a novel sampling strategy that samples in the discrete domain. Our experimental results show that the proposed method could efficiently generate valid configurations. Using those configurations, the planner successfully folds several types of rigid origami that the existing methods fail to fold and could discover multiple folding paths in different homotopies."
icra,None,Completely randomized RRT-connect: A case study on 3D rigid body motion planning,"Daniel Schneider,Elmar Schömer,Nicola Wolpert,","Nowadays sampling-based motion planners use the power of randomization to compute multidimensional motions at high performance. Nevertheless the performance is based on problem-dependent parameters like the weighting of translation versus rotation and the planning range of the algorithm. Former work uses constant user-adjusted values for these parameters which are defined a priori. Our new approach extends the power of randomization by varying the parameters randomly during runtime. This avoids a preprocessing step to adjust parameters and moreover improves the performance in comparison to existing methods in the majority of the benchmarks. Our method is simple to understand and implement. In order to compare our approach we present a comprehensive experimental analysis about the parameters and the resulting performance. The algorithms and data structures were implemented in our own library RASAND, but we also compare the results of our work with OMPL [12] and the commercial software Kineo™ Kite Lab [15]."
icra,None,Lazy collision checking in asymptotically-optimal motion planning,"Kris Hauser,","Asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion planners, like RRT*, perform vast amounts of collision checking, and are hence rather slow to converge in complex problems where collision checking is relatively expensive. This paper presents two novel motion planners, Lazy-PRM* and Lazy-RRG*, that eliminate the majority of collision checks using a lazy strategy. They are sampling-based, any-time, and asymptotically complete algorithms that grow a network of feasible vertices connected by edges. Edges are not immediately checked for collision, but rather are checked only when a better path to the goal is found. This strategy avoids checking the vast majority of edges that have no chance of being on an optimal path. Experiments show that the new methods converge toward the optimum substantially faster than existing planners on rigid body path planning and robot manipulation problems."

By free configuration space, we mean the set of all equilibrium configurations of the rod that are stable (i.e. locally minimize elastic potential energy) and do not experience self-intersections. We also provide semi-analytical expressions for paths in the free configuration space that connect any two stable equilibrium configurations that do not contain self-intersections. These results are applied to the problem of manipulation planning for deformable objects."

It is assumed that the robot is subject to kinematic (joint limits, joint velocity bounds) as well as dynamic (torque bounds) constraints. Building on our previous work on task-constrained motion planning, we describe a randomized planner that works directly at the torque level and generates solutions by separating geometric motions from time history. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by planning collision-free swing-up maneuvers for a Pendubot system."
icra,None,Fractal trajectories for online non-uniform aerial coverage,"Seyed Abbas Sadat,Jens Wawerla,Richard Vaughan,","We propose a novel method for non-uniform terrain coverage using Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The existing methods for coverage path planning consider a uniformly interesting target area and hence all the regions are covered with high resolution. However in many real world applications items of interest are not uniformly distributed but form patches of locally high interest. Therefore, with sparse sampling of uninteresting sections of the environment and high resolution sampling of interesting patches, the trajectory of the robot can become shorter. In this paper, we present a novel coverage strategy based on Space-Filling Curves that can accomplish non-uniform coverage of regions in the target area. Simulations and real robot experiments indicate that with the new strategy, travel time / cost of the task can be (almost) always less than a regular `lawnmower' coverage pattern."
icra,None,Reachable volume RRT,"Troy McMahon,Shawna Thomas,Nancy M. Amato,","Reachable volumes are a new technique that allows one to efficiently restrict sampling to feasible/reachable regions of the planning space even for high degree of freedom and highly constrained problems. However, they have so far only been applied to graph-based sampling-based planners. In this paper we develop the methodology to apply reachable volumes to tree-based planners such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs). In particular, we propose a reachable volume RRT called RVRRT that can solve high degree of freedom problems and problems with constraints. To do so, we develop a reachable volume stepping function, a reachable volume expand function, and a distance metric based on these operations. We also present a reachable volume local planner to ensure that local paths satisfy constraints for methods such as PRMs. We show experimentally that RVRRTs can solve constrained problems with as many as 64 degrees of freedom and unconstrained problems with as many as 134 degrees of freedom. RVRRTs can solve problems more efficiently than existing methods, requiring fewer nodes and collision detection calls. We also show that it is capable of solving difficult problems that existing methods cannot."
icra,None,Efficient high-quality motion planning by fast all-pairs r-nearest-neighbors,"Michal Kleinbort,Oren Salzman,Dan Halperin,","Sampling-based motion-planning algorithms typically rely on nearest-neighbor (NN) queries when constructing a roadmap. Recent results suggest that in various settings NN queries may be the computational bottleneck of such algorithms. Moreover, in several asymptotically-optimal algorithms these NN queries are of a specific form: Given a set of points and a radius r report all pairs of points whose distance is at most r. This calls for an application-specific NN data structure tailored to efficiently answering this type of queries. Randomly transformed grids (RTG) were recently proposed by Aiger et al. [1] as a tool to answer such queries in Euclidean spaces and have been shown to outperform common implementations of NN data structures for this type of queries. In this work we employ RTG for sampling-based motion-planning algorithms and describe an efficient implementation of the approach. We show that for motion planning, RTG allow for faster convergence to high-quality solutions when compared to existing NN data structures. Additionally, RTG enable significantly shorter construction times for batched-PRM variants; specifically, we demonstrate a speedup by a factor of two to three for some scenarios."
icra,None,A predictive model for narrow passage path planner by using Support Vector Machine in changing environments,"Hong Liu,Fang Xiao,Can Wang,","Narrow passages in changing environments create huge difficulties, since locations and shapes of narrow passages in Configuration Space(C-space) change frequently. It is very important for a planner to identify narrow passages in real time and boost valid points within them effectively. A novel narrow passage predictive model for designing a path planner in changing environments is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an Expanded Dynamic Bridge Builder is presented to identify narrow passages rapidly with validity-toggle sampling points in C-space. Secondly, the predictive model is adopted to sample possibly free points within these narrow passages without invoking any collision detection in order to avoid intense computational complexity. The predictive model is obtained by the famous classification method of Support Vector Machine (SVM). A new feature, which includes a group of points' distance and validity information, is proposed in SVM training process to capture approximate structure of local narrow passages. Therefore, the predictive model can excavate the hidden similar structure of local narrow passages. Experiments carried out with two 6-DOFs manipulators show that our approach gain higher success rate of planning and time efficiency than other related methods."

It has been popular to recognize the human gait from kinematic data. However, the recognition from muscle activities, the input of the movement, has not been widely approached. In this paper, we propose a framework to recognize the human walking and running movements by investigating muscle activities through electromyography (EMG). The framework is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) topology utilizing Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) technique to extract feature vectors. We show that: (1) the high-dimensional EMG data can be embedded into a lower-dimensional space by using a manifold learning algorithm (LLE), primitive components which give meaningful representation of the EMG can be extracted, and (2) our proposed HMM topology whose input are the extracted vectors from EMG can recognize the gait movement at an accuracy rate of over 80%."
icra,None,Temporal integration of feature correspondences for enhanced recognition in cluttered and dynamic environments,"Thomas Fäulhammer,Aitor Aldoma,Michael Zillich,Markus Vincze,","We propose a method for recognizing rigid object instances in RGB-D point clouds by accumulating low-level information from keypoint correspondences over multiple observations. Compared to existing multi-view approaches, we make fewer assumptions on the recognition problem, dealing with cluttered and partially dynamic environments as well as covering a wide range of objects. Evaluation on the publicly available TUW and Willow datasets showed that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance for challenging sequences of static environments and a significant improvement for environments partially changing during the observation."
icra,None,Comparison of rigid body motion trajectory descriptors for motion representation and recognition,"Maxim Vochten,Tinne De Laet,Joris De Schutter,","This paper presents an overview and comparison of minimal and complete rigid body motion trajectory descriptors, usable in applications like motion recognition and programming by demonstration. Motion trajectory descriptors are able to deal with potentially unwanted variations acting on the motion trajectory such as changes in the execution time, the motion's starting position, or the viewpoint from which the motion is observed. A suitable rigid body motion trajectory descriptor retains only the trajectory information relevant to the application. This paper compares different trajectory descriptors for rigid body motion and validates their usefulness for dealing with motion variation in a motion recognition experiment. Furthermore, a new type of invariant trajectory descriptor is introduced based on the Frenet-Serret formulas."
icra,None,Human activity recognition using LZW-Coded Probabilistic Finite State Automata,"James Wilson,Nayeff Najjar,James Hare,Shalabh Gupta,","Human activity recognition has become an increasingly important field of research with many practical applications related to health care and leisure activities. The accessibility of inexpensive portable sensors, such as accelerometers, allows for a widespread use of this technology for both commercial and personal activity recognition. This paper develops a novel feature extraction approach to human activity recognition through the development of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch Coded Probabilistic Finite State Automata (LZW-Coded PFSA) to classify activities such as walking, jumping, running, waist rotations, and shoulder rotations. The PFSA reveal the underlying architecture of a given activity and classify it without making any a priori assumptions by inferring patterns from the sensor measurements. LZW-Coded PFSA select the optimal variable length state from the time-series data and compress it into class-separable state transition matrices π. This algorithm is robust to subject biases and is shown to be effective with a correct classification rate of 95.63%."
icra,None,Gesture recognition using hybrid generative-discriminative approach with Fisher Vector,"Yusuke Goutsu,Wataru Takano,Yoshihiko Nakamura,","Gesture recognition is used for many practical applications such as human-robot interaction, medical rehabilitation and sign language. In this paper, we apply a hybrid generative-discriminative approach by using the Fisher Vector to improve the recognition performance. The strategy is to merge the generative approach of Hidden Markov Model dealing with spatio-temporal motion data with the discriminative approach of Support Vector Machine focusing on the classification task. The motion segments are encoded into HMMs, and each segment is converted to FV, whose elements can be obtained as the derivative of the probability of the segment being generated by the HMMs with respect to their parameters. SVM is subsequently trained by the FVs. An input gesture can be classified to corresponding gesture category by SVM. In the experiments, we test our approach by comparing three HMM chain models and four categorization methods on dataset provided by the ChaLearn Looking at People Challenge 2014 (LAP 2014). The results show that similar gesture patterns are clustered closely in several categories. Our approach based left-to-right HMMs outperforms other gesture recognition methods. More specifically, the hybrid generative-discriminative approach overcomes the standard HMM approach and the generative kernel approach overcomes the generative embedding approach. For these results, our approach is effective to improve the recognition performance."
icra,None,Pole-like object detection and classification from urban point clouds,"Jing Huang,Suya You,","This paper focuses on detecting and classifying pole-like objects from point clouds obtained in urban areas. To achieve our goal, we propose a system consisting of three stages: localization, segmentation and classification. The localization algorithm based on slicing, clustering, pole seed generation and bucket augmentation takes advantage of the unique characteristics of pole-like objects and avoids heavy computation on the feature of every point in traditional methods. Then, the bucket-shaped neighborhood of the segments is integrated and trimmed with region growing algorithms, reducing the noises within candidate's neighborhood. Finally, we introduce a representation of six attributes based on the height and five point classes closely related to the pole categories and apply SVM to classify the candidate objects into 4 categories, including 3 pole categories light, utility pole and sign, and the non-pole category. The performance of our method is demonstrated through comparison with previous works on a large-scale urban dataset."
icra,None,Real-time full-body human gender recognition in (RGB)-D data,"Timm Linder,Sven Wehner,Kai O. Arras,","Understanding social context is an important skill for robots that share a space with humans. In this paper, we address the problem of recognizing gender, a key piece of information when interacting with people and understanding human social relations and rules. Unlike previous work which typically considered faces or frontal body views in image data, we address the problem of recognizing gender in RGB-D data from side and back views as well. We present a large, gender-balanced, annotated, multi-perspective RGB-D dataset with full-body views of over a hundred different persons captured with both the Kinect v1 and Kinect v2 sensor. We then learn and compare several classifiers on the Kinect v2 data using a HOG baseline, two state-of-the-art deep-learning methods, and a recent tessellation-based learning approach. Originally developed for person detection in 3D data, the latter is able to learn the best selection, location and scale of a set of simple point cloud features. We show that for gender recognition, it outperforms the other approaches for both standing and walking people while being very efficient to compute with classification rates up to 150 Hz."
icra,None,Pushbroom stereo for high-speed navigation in cluttered environments,"Andrew J. Barry,Russ Tedrake,","We present a novel stereo vision algorithm that is capable of obstacle detection on a mobile ARM processor at 120 frames per second. Our system performs a subset of standard block-matching stereo processing, searching only for obstacles at a single depth. By using an onboard IMU and state-estimator, we can recover the position of obstacles at all other depths, building and updating a local depth-map at framerate. Here, we describe both the algorithm and our implementation on a high-speed, small UAV, flying at over 20 MPH (9 m/s) close to obstacles. The system requires no external sensing or computation and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first high-framerate stereo detection system running onboard a small UAV."
icra,None,Bio-inspired predictive orientation decomposition of skeleton trajectories for real-time human activity prediction,"Hao Zhang,Lynne E. Parker,","Activity prediction is an essential task in practical human-centered robotics applications, such as security, assisted living, etc., which targets at inferring ongoing human activities based on incomplete observations. To address this challenging problem, we introduce a novel bio-inspired predictive orientation decomposition (BIPOD) approach to construct representations of people from 3D skeleton trajectories. Our approach is inspired by biological research in human anatomy. In order to capture spatio-temporal information of human motions, we spatially decompose 3D human skeleton trajectories and project them onto three anatomical planes (i.e., coronal, transverse and sagittal planes); then, we describe short-term time information of joint motions and encode high-order temporal dependencies. By estimating future skeleton trajectories that are not currently observed, we endow our BIPOD representation with the critical predictive capability. Empirical studies validate that our BIPOD approach obtains promising performance, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, using a physical TurtleBot2 robotic platform to recognize ongoing human activities. Experiments on benchmark datasets further demonstrate that our new BIPOD representation significantly outperforms previous approaches for real-time activity classification and prediction from 3D human skeleton trajectories."
icra,None,Extending the Knowledge of Volumes approach to robot task planning with efficient geometric predicates,"Andre Gaschler,Ingmar Kessler,Ronald P. A. Petrick,Alois Knoll,","For robots to solve hard tasks in real-world manufacturing and service contexts, they need to reason about both symbolic and geometric preconditions, and the effects of complex actions. We use an existing Knowledge of Volumes approach to robot task planning (KVP), which facilitates hybrid planning with symbolic actions and continuous-valued robot and object motion, and make two important additions to this approach: (i) new geometric predicates are added for complex object manipulation planning, and (ii) all geometric queries-such as collision and inclusion of objects and swept volumes-are implemented with a single-sided, bounded approximation, which calculates efficient and safe robot motion paths. Our task planning framework is evaluated in multiple scenarios, using concise and generic scenario definitions."
icra,None,Batch Informed Trees (BIT*): Sampling-based optimal planning via the heuristically guided search of implicit random geometric graphs,"Jonathan D. Gammell,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,Timothy D. Barfoot,","In this paper, we present Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), a planning algorithm based on unifying graph- and sampling-based planning techniques. By recognizing that a set of samples describes an implicit random geometric graph (RGG), we are able to combine the efficient ordered nature of graph-based techniques, such as A*, with the anytime scalability of sampling-based algorithms, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). BIT* uses a heuristic to efficiently search a series of increasingly dense implicit RGGs while reusing previous information. It can be viewed as an extension of incremental graph-search techniques, such as Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*), to continuous problem domains as well as a generalization of existing sampling-based optimal planners. It is shown that it is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. We demonstrate the utility of BIT* on simulated random worlds in R 2 and R 8 and manipulation problems on CMU's HERB, a 14-DOF two-armed robot. On these problems, BIT* finds better solutions faster than RRT, RRT*, Informed RRT*, and Fast Marching Trees (FMT*) with faster anytime convergence towards the optimum, especially in high dimensions."
icra,None,Kinodynamic randomized rearrangement planning via dynamic transitions between statically stable states,"Joshua A. Haustein,Jennifer King,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,Tamim Asfour,","In this work we present a fast kinodynamic RRT-planner that uses dynamic nonprehensile actions to rearrange cluttered environments. In contrast to many previous works, the presented planner is not restricted to quasi-static interactions and monotonicity. Instead the results of dynamic robot actions are predicted using a black box physics model. Given a general set of primitive actions and a physics model, the planner randomly explores the configuration space of the environment to find a sequence of actions that transform the environment into some goal configuration. In contrast to a naive kinodynamic RRT-planner we show that we can exploit the physical fact that in an environment with friction any object eventually comes to rest. This allows a search on the configuration space rather than the state space, reducing the dimension of the search space by a factor of two without restricting us to non-dynamic interactions. We compare our algorithm against a naive kinodynamic RRT-planner and show that on a variety of environments we can achieve a higher planning success rate given a restricted time budget for planning."
icra,None,A new algebraic approach for the description of robotic manipulation tasks,"Ernesto Pablo Lana,Bruno Vilhena Adorno,Carlos Andrey Maia,","This paper introduces the Manipulation Task Model (MTM), an algebraic approach to describe manipulation tasks for robotic systems. The model is based on dual quaternion algebra to describe poses, linear and angular velocities, and forces and moments, all of which are joined to form the algebraic group of actions. We then use this group together with process algebra to describe temporal and logical relations between actions composing manipulation tasks. A simulation example of a cleaner robot shows that the proposed model is comprehensive and expressive enough, and that it provides robustness in relation to perturbations at the task level. Future developments will include merging the model with underlying controllers in order to provide a unified means for description, planning, and execution of manipulation tasks for robotic systems."
icra,None,Robust trajectory design for object throwing based on sensitivity for model uncertainties,"Masafumi Okada,Alexander Pekarovskiy,Martin Buss,","Throwing an object by a powered robot system is of great importance in unmanned environments. In this paper, we consider the problem of throwing a point-mass object to minimize uncertainty in the object's landing position, given uncertainty in (1) the robot's initial configuration and (2) friction at the joints. Our analysis assumes that the robot's throw is executed using open-loop torque commands, and it relies on the linearized sensitivities of (a) landing location with respect to release state, (b) release state with respect to initial robot configuration and (c) joint friction. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations."
icra,None,Task-oriented planning for manipulating articulated mechanisms under model uncertainty,"Venkatraman Narayanan,Maxim Likhachev,","Personal robots need to manipulate a variety of articulated mechanisms as part of day-to-day tasks. These tasks are often specific, goal-driven, and permit very little bootstrap time for learning the articulation type. In this work, we address the problem of purposefully manipulating an articulated object, with uncertainty in the type of articulation. To this end, we provide two primary contributions: first, an efficient planning algorithm that, given a set of candidate articulation models, is able to correctly identify the underlying model and simultaneously complete a task; and second, a representation for articulated objects called the Generalized Kinematic Graph (GK-Graph), that allows for modeling complex mechanisms whose articulation varies as a function of the state space. Finally, we provide a practical method to auto-generate candidate articulation models from RGB-D data and present extensive results on the PR2 robot to demonstrate the utility of our representation and the efficiency of our planner."
icra,None,Physics-based trajectory optimization for grasping in cluttered environments,"Nikita Kitaev,Igor Mordatch,Sachin Patil,Pieter Abbeel,","Grasping an object in a cluttered, unorganized environment is challenging because of unavoidable contacts and interactions between the robot and multiple immovable (static) and movable (dynamic) obstacles in the environment. Planning an approach trajectory for grasping in such situations can benefit from physics-based simulations that describe the dynamics of the interaction between the robot manipulator and the environment. In this work, we present a physics-based trajectory optimization approach for planning grasp approach trajectories. We present novel cost objectives and identify failure modes relevant to grasping in cluttered environments. Our approach uses rollouts of physics-based simulations to compute the gradient of the objective and of the dynamics. Our approach naturally generates behaviors such as choosing to push objects that are less likely to topple over, recognizing and avoiding situations which might cause a cascade of objects to fall over, and adjusting the manipulator trajectory to push objects aside in a direction orthogonal to the grasping direction. We present results in simulation for grasping in a variety of cluttered environments with varying levels of density of obstacles in the environment. Our experiments in simulation indicate that our approach outperforms a baseline approach that considers multiple straight-line trajectories modified to account for static obstacles by an aggregate success rate of 14% with varying degrees of object clutter."
icra,None,Planning on searching occluded target object with a mobile robot manipulator,"Yu-Chi Lin,Shao-Ting Wei,Shih-An Yang,Li-Chen Fu,","Object search is a fundamental ability for a service robot to provide higher level services. We focus on object search in an environment with limited free space to place objects and constrained viewpoints to observe the environment, such as a shelf or a cupboard. We propose an object search planner based on A* search algorithm with tree node sampling. The proposed approach also combines visual and arm manipulation search. In other words, the robot searches occluded target object by either repositioning one of the accessible object with its arm or moving its platform to view the environment from a different pose. We evaluate the proposed approach with experiment performed by real robot in the scenario which objects may occlude or block access to one another."
icra,None,Manipulation planning with contacts for an extensible elastic rod by sampling on the submanifold of static equilibrium configurations,"Olivier Roussel,Andy Borum,Michel Taïx,Timothy Bretl,","We consider the manipulation planning problem of an extensible elastic rod in collision-free or contact space. We assume the rod can be handled by grippers either at both or at only one of its extremities and during the manipulation, the grasped end may change. We show that the use of both quasi-static and dynamic models can be coupled efficiently with sampling-based methods. By sampling directly on the submanifold of static equilibrium and contact-free configurations, we can take advantage of the dynamic model to improve the exploration in the state space. We show the necessity of considering contacts for this type of problems with several simulation experiments on various scenarios."
icra,None,Fiberbot: A miniature crawling robot using a directional fibrillar pad,"Yuanfeng Han,Hamidreza Marvi,Metin Sitti,","Vibration-driven locomotion has been widely used for crawling robot studies. Such robots usually have a vibration motor as the actuator and a fibrillar structure for providing directional friction on the substrate. However, there has not been any studies about the effect of fiber structure on robot crawling performance. In this paper, we develop Fiberbot, a custom made mini vibration robot, for studying the effect of fiber angle on robot velocity, steering, and climbing performance. It is known that the friction force with and against fibers depends on the fiber angle. Thus, we first present a new fabrication method for making millimeter scale fibers at a wide range of angles. We then show that using 30° angle fibers that have the highest friction anisotropy (ratio of backward to forward friction force) among the other fibers we fabricated in this study, Fiberbot speed on glass increases to 13.8±0.4 cm/s (compared to ν = 0.6±0.1 cm/s using vertical fibers). We also demonstrate that the locomotion direction of Fiberbot depends on the tilting direction of fibers and we can steer the robot by rotating the fiber pad. Fiberbot could also climb on glass at inclinations of up to 10° when equipped with fibers of high friction anisotropy. We show that adding a rigid tail to the robot it can climb on glass at 25° inclines. Moreover, the robot is able to crawl on rough surfaces such as wood (ν = 10.0±0.2 cm/s using 30° fiber pad). Fiberbot, a low-cost vibration robot equipped with a custom-designed fiber pad with steering and climbing capabilities could be used for studies on collective behavior on a wide range of topographies as well as search and exploratory missions."
icra,None,Comparing the effect of different spine and leg designs for a small bounding quadruped robot,"Peter Eckert,Alexander Spröwitz,Hartmut Witte,Auke Jan Ijspeert,","We present Lynx-robot, a quadruped, modular, compliant machine. It alternately features a directly actuated, single-joint spine design, or an actively supported, passive compliant, multi-joint spine configuration. Both spine configurations bend in the sagittal plane. This study aims at characterizing these two, largely different spine concepts, for a bounding gait of a robot with a three segmented, pantograph leg design. An earlier, similar-sized, bounding, quadruped robot named Bobcat with a two-segment leg design and a directly actuated, single-joint spine design serves as a comparison robot, to study and compare the effect of the leg design on speed, while keeping the spine design fixed. Both proposed spine designs (single rotatory and active and multi-joint compliant) reach moderate, self-stable speeds."
icra,None,A passively sprawling miniature legged robot,"Adam Stager,Konstantinos Karydis,Herbert G. Tanner,","The paper reports on the design and preliminary experimental testing of a novel 3D-printed miniature legged robot. It is called Passively Sprawling Robot (PSR), and it features a mechanism that achieves passive adjustment of the sprawl angle of the robot's legs. Passive sprawling in this robot exhibits compliance by design, yet it can be controlled indirectly by regulating the yaw rate. Spring-loaded assemblies on the left and right side of the robot function independently, allowing the vehicle to overcome asymmetrical obstacles with improved lateral stability, and withstand falls from moderate heights without sustaining structural damage. The regulation of the sprawling angle by means of varying yaw rates, as well as the improved motion characteristics have been experimentally observed and verified, and open-loop motion accuracy along straight and constant curvature paths was tested on a number of repeated trials."
icra,None,"Obstacle crossing of a real, compliant robot based on local evasion movements and averaging of stance heights using singular value decomposition","Jan Paskarbeit,Malte Schilling,Josef Schmitz,Axel Schneider,","The main advantage of multi-legged robots is the ability to traverse uneven terrain and to overcome obstacles that would impede the movement of a wheeled robot. Compliant joint drives can further improve the performance of legged robot systems by considerably reducing the problems associated with uneven or slippery footholds. Small changes of the foot position in uneven terrain are compensated by the passive joint compliance without the need for fast contact detection and controller responses while the mechanical tension is reduced. On rougher terrain with bigger elevations/depressions of the surface structure, however, a reliable ground contact detection and stance height regulation for each leg is required to distribute the weight of the robot evenly among the legs on ground during stance phase. This work presents a concept that allows the inherently compliant hexapod robot HECTOR to walk on uneven terrain and to overcome moderate obstacles by means of a decentralized walking controller. An important prerequisite is the availability of inherently compliant joint drives with an increased power/weight-ratio."
icra,None,Finding answers to biological control methods using modulated patterns: An application to bio-inspired robotic fish,"Abhra Roy Chowdhury,S K Panda,",This paper presents a bio-inspired robotic fish undulatory swimming behaviour modeling and control using modulated pattern generators (MPG). Carangiform fish locomotion pattern is closely mimicked using a LH body wave (with its parameters: Tail-beat frequency (TBF) and Caudal amplitude (CA)) modulated by rhythmic central pattern generator (CPG) signal. A Matsuoka based non-linear oscillator CPG structure is used to generate desired rhythmic pattern preserving control properties like system stability (limit cycle behaviour) and synchronization. A two level locomotion control architecture based on vertebrate fish biology is proposed. Higher level controller generates desired trajectory as encoded patterns MPGs. Synchronization of the desired trajectories at each joint with the robotic fish dynamics generates desired fishlike locomotion behavior. Lower level control scheme uses an inverse dynamics model based policy for tracking this locomotion pattern (joint positions). It is shown that MPGs can represent the shape (amplitude) and phase (frequency) patterns of high-dimensional periodic inputs using simple kinematic parameters. Proposed inverse dynamics model based tracking control strategy is found to perform in a stable operating margin..

The robot uses soft silicone elastomer based pneumatic actuators as legs that accelerate the platform upwards by rapid pressurization. The robot is able to control and adjust the direction of the jumping by altering the timing patterns in which the individual legs are activated.
icra,None,Self-folding and self-actuating robots: A pneumatic approach,"Xu Sun,Samuel M. Felton,Ryuma Niiyama,Robert J. Wood,Sangbae Kim,","Self-assembling robots can be transported and deployed inexpensively and autonomously in remote and dangerous environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-assembling method with a planar pneumatic system. Inflation of pouches translate into shape changes, turning a sheet of composite material into a complex robotic structure. This new method enables a flat origami-based robotic structure to self-fold to desired angles with pressure control. It allows a static joint to become dynamic, self-actuate to reconfigure itself after initial folding. Finally, the folded robot can unfold itself at the end of a robotic application. We believe this new pneumatic approach provides an important toolkit to build more powerful and capable self-assembling robots."
icra,None,A self-deployable origami structure with locking mechanism induced by buckling effect,"Jongwoo Kim,Dae-Young Lee,Sa-Reum Kim,Kyu-Jin Cho,","One of the major problems in utilizing origami structures is ensuring variable stiffness; a deployable structure needs to become stiff or flexible according to the requirements of its use in an application. In this study, we present a self-deploying tubular origami mechanism that switches between two distinctive states: small and flexible at its normal state and rigid and stiffened at a locked state. By embedding compact torsional SMA actuators into the mechanism in a novel way through stitching, the process of deploying from the normal to the locked state proceeds in a simple and low-profile manner. With global heating, the torsional SMA wires activate a buckling effect that draws a radical change of folding line from one diagonal to another in every unit tile of the tube, creating axial stiffness. The activated structure, which weighs only 2.9 g, can endure a load of 2.7 kg or more. Additionally, since it does not require bulky actuators, this origami structure can be highly mobile and small in size. This novel origami mechanism is expected to be useful in a wide variety of applications, such as aerospace equipment, mobile architecture, and medical devices, especially those used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS)."
icra,None,A miniature surface tension-driven robot mimicking the water-surface locomotion of water strider,"Xinbin Zhang,Jihong Yan,Jie Zhao,Gangfeng Liu,Hegao Cai,Qinmin Pan,","Aiming at mimicking water strider's water-surface locomotion, this study proposes a new miniature surface tension-driven robot. A key feature of this robot is that its actuating legs possess ellipse-like spatial trajectories like water strider by using a cam-link mechanism, and never pierces water surface when rowing. A set of simple models and equations are proposed to analyze the interaction forces between leg and water as well as the critical condition for a leg penetrating a water surface. The final fabricated robot weights about 3.9 g with a load capacity of 5.6 g. By controlling the motions of actuating legs, the robot can freely and stably walk on water with different gaits. The maximum forward and turning speeds of the robot are measured as 16 cm/s and 23 °/s, respectively. Moreover, a similarity analysis with Bond Number and Weber Number reveals that the locomotion of this robot is quite analogous to that of a water strider: surface tension force dominates the lifting force and plays a major role in the propulsion."
icra,None,Learning to assess terrain from human demonstration using an introspective Gaussian-process classifier,"Laszlo-Peter Berczi,Ingmar Posner,Timothy D. Barfoot,","This paper presents an approach to learning robot terrain assessment from human demonstration. An operator drives a robot for a short period of time, supervising the gathering of traversable and untraversable terrain data. After this initial training period, the robot can then predict the traversability of new terrain based on its experiences. We improve on current methods in two ways: first, we maintain a richer (higher-dimensional) representation of the terrain that is better able to distinguish between different training examples. Second, we use a Gaussian-process classifier for terrain assessment due to its superior introspective abilities (leading to better uncertainty estimates) when compared to other classifier methods in the literature. Our method is tested on real data and shown to outperform current methods both in classification accuracy and uncertainty estimation."
icra,None,Learning inverse dynamics models with contacts,"Roberto Calandra,Serena Ivaldi,Marc Peter Deisenroth,Elmar Rueckert,,","In whole-body control, joint torques and external forces need to be estimated accurately. In principle, this can be done through pervasive joint-torque sensing and accurate system identification. However, these sensors are expensive and may not be integrated in all links. Moreover, the exact position of the contact must be known for a precise estimation. If contacts occur on the whole body, tactile sensors can estimate the contact location, but this requires a kinematic spatial calibration, which is prone to errors. Accumulating errors may have dramatic effects on the system identification. As an alternative to classical model-based approaches we propose a data-driven mixture-of-experts learning approach using Gaussian processes. This model predicts joint torques directly from raw data of tactile and force/torque sensors. We compare our approach to an analytic model-based approach on real world data recorded from the humanoid iCub. We show that the learned model accurately predicts the joint torques resulting from contact forces, is robust to changes in the environment and outperforms existing dynamic models that use of force/ torque sensor data."
icra,None,Learning movement primitives for force interaction tasks,"Jens Kober,Michael Gienger,Jochen J. Steil,","Kinesthetic teaching is a promising approach to acquire robot skills in an intuitive way. This paper focuses on learning skills that do not solely rely on kinematics but also need to take into account interaction forces. We present three novel concepts towards learning such force interaction skills. Firstly, we determine segments from a small number of continuous kinesthetic demonstrations using contact information. Secondly, we associate each segment with a movement primitive, and determine its composition, i.e., the control variables and reference frames that allow to reproduce the demonstrated task. Lastly, we propose a concept to determine the transitions between the primitives during reproduction. The proposed methods are evaluated on a box pulling and flipping task, and show very good generalization abilities for objects with different geometries, and situations with different object arrangements."
icra,None,Self-supervised learning of grasp dependent tool affordances on the iCub Humanoid robot,"Tanis Mar,Vadim Tikhanoff,Giorgio Metta,Lorenzo Natale,","The ability to learn about and efficiently use tools constitutes a desirable property for general purpose humanoid robots, as it allows them to extend their capabilities beyond the limitations of their own body. Yet, it is a topic that has only recently been tackled from the robotics community. Most of the studies published so far make use of tool representations that allow their models to generalize the knowledge among similar tools in a very limited way. Moreover, most studies assume that the tool is always grasped in its common or canonical grasp position, thus not considering the influence of the grasp configuration in the outcome of the actions performed with them. In the current paper we present a method that tackles both issues simultaneously by using an extended set of functional features and a novel representation of the effect of the tool use. Together, they implicitly account for the grasping configuration and allow the iCub to generalize among tools based on their geometry. Moreover, learning happens in a self-supervised manner: First, the robot autonomously discovers the affordance categories of the tools by clustering the effect of their usage. These categories are subsequently used as a teaching signal to associate visually obtained functional features to the expected tool's affordance. In the experiments, we show how this technique can be effectively used to select, given a tool, the best action to achieve a desired effect."
icra,None,Learning Predictive State Representation for in-hand manipulation,"Johannes A. Stork,Carl Henrik Ek,Yasemin Bekiroglu,Danica Kragic,","We study the use of Predictive State Representation (PSR) for modeling of an in-hand manipulation task through interaction with the environment. We extend the original PSR model to a new domain of in-hand manipulation and address the problem of partial observability by introducing new kernel-based features that integrate both actions and observations. The model is learned directly from haptic data and is used to plan series of actions that rotate the object in the hand to a specific configuration by pushing it against a table. Further, we analyze the model's belief states using additional visual data and enable planning of action sequences when the observations are ambiguous. We show that the learned representation is geometrically meaningful by embedding labeled action-observation traces. Suitability for planning is demonstrated by a post-grasp manipulation example that changes the object state to multiple specified target configurations."
icra,None,Inverse reinforcement learning of behavioral models for online-adapting navigation strategies,"Michael Herman,Volker Fischer,Tobias Gindele,Wolfram Burgard,","To increase the acceptance of autonomous systems in populated environments, it is indispensable to teach them social behavior. We would expect a social robot, which plans its motions among humans, to consider both the social acceptability of its behavior as well as task constraints, such as time limits. These requirements are often contradictory and therefore resulting in a trade-off. For example, a robot has to decide whether it is more important to quickly achieve its goal or to comply with social conventions, such as the proximity to humans, i.e., the robot has to react adaptively to task-specific priorities. In this paper, we present a method for priority-adaptive navigation of mobile autonomous systems, which optimizes the social acceptability of the behavior while meeting task constraints. We learn acceptability-dependent behavioral models from human demonstrations by using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). These models are generative and describe the learned stochastic behavior. We choose the optimum behavioral model by maximizing the social acceptability under constraints on expected time-limits and reliabilities. This approach is evaluated in the context of driving behaviors based on the highway scenario of Levine et al. [1]."
icra,None,Deep learning helicopter dynamics models,"Ali Punjani,Pieter Abbeel,","We consider the problem of system identification of helicopter dynamics. Helicopters are complex systems, coupling rigid body dynamics with aerodynamics, engine dynamics, vibration, and other phenomena. Resultantly, they pose a challenging system identification problem, especially when considering non-stationary flight regimes. We pose the dynamics modeling problem as direct high-dimensional regression, and take inspiration from recent results in Deep Learning to represent the helicopter dynamics with a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Network Model, a hierarchical neural network model. We provide a simple method for initializing the parameters of the model, and optimization details for training. We describe three baseline models and show that they are significantly outperformed by the ReLU Network Model in experiments on real data, indicating the power of the model to capture useful structure in system dynamics across a rich array of aerobatic maneuvers. Specifically, the ReLU Network Model improves 58% overall in RMS acceleration prediction over state-of-the-art methods. Predicting acceleration along the helicopter's up-down axis is empirically found to be the most difficult, and the ReLU Network Model improves by 60% over the prior state-of-the-art. We discuss explanations of these performance gains, and also investigate the impact of hyperparameters in the novel model."

Recent work [1], [2], [3] has shown promising results that enable robotic manipulation of deformable objects through learning from demonstrations. Their approach is able to generalize from a single demonstration to new test situations, and suggests a nearest neighbor approach to select a demonstration to adapt to a given test situation. Such a nearest neighbor approach, however, ignores important aspects of the problem: brittleness (versus robustness) of demonstrations when generalized through this process, and the extent to which a demonstration makes progress towards a goal. In this paper, we frame the problem of selecting which demonstration to transfer as an options Markov decision process (MDP). We present max-margin Q-function estimation: an approach to learn a Q-function from expert demonstrations. Our learned policies account for variability in robustness of demonstrations and the sequential nature of our tasks. We developed two knot-tying benchmarks to experimentally validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The selection strategy described in [2] achieves success rates of 70% and 54%, respectively. Our approach performs significantly better, with success rates of 88% and 76%, respectively."
icra,None,Optimism-driven exploration for nonlinear systems,"Teodor Mihai Moldovan,Sergey Levine,Michael I. Jordan,Pieter Abbeel,","Tasks with unknown dynamics and costly system interaction time present a serious challenge for reinforcement learning. If a model of the dynamics can be learned quickly, interaction time can be reduced substantially. We show that combining an optimistic exploration strategy with model-predictive control can achieve very good sample complexity for a range of nonlinear systems. Our method learns a Dirichlet process mixture of linear models using an exploration strategy based on optimism in the face of uncertainty. Trajectory optimization is used to plan paths in the learned model that both minimize the cost and perform exploration. Experimental results show that our approach achieves some of the most sample-efficient learning rates on several benchmark problems, and is able to successfully learn to control a simulated helicopter during hover and autorotation with only seconds of interaction time. The computational requirements are substantial."
icra,None,Plan execution monitoring through detection of unmet expectations about action outcomes,"Juan Pablo Mendoza,Manuela Veloso,Reid Simmons,","Modeling the effects of actions based on the state of the world enables robots to make intelligent decisions in different situations. However, it is often infeasible to have globally accurate models. Task performance is often hindered by discrepancies between models and the real world, since the true outcome of executing a plan may be significantly worse than the expected outcome used during planning. Furthermore, expectations about the world are often stochastic in robotics, making the discovery of model-world discrepancies non-trivial. We present an execution monitoring framework capable of finding statistically significant discrepancies, determining the situations in which they occur, and making simple corrections to the world model to improve performance. In our approach, plans are initially based on a model of the world that is only as faithful as computational and algorithmic limitations allow. Through experience, the monitor discovers previously unmodeled modes of the world, defined as regions of a feature space in which the experienced outcome of a plan deviates significantly from the predicted outcome. The monitor may then make suggestions to change the model to match the real world more accurately. We demonstrate this approach on the adversarial domain of robot soccer: we monitor pass interception performance of potentially unknown opponents to try to find unforeseen modes of behavior that affect their interception performance."
icra,None,Zig-zag wanderer: Towards adaptive tracking of time-varying coherent structures in the ocean,"Dhanushka Kularatne,Ryan N. Smith,M. Ani Hsieh,","Similar to the atmosphere, coherent structures, e.g., fronts, exist in the ocean. These frontal structures are known to be highly productive, supporting the whole spectrum of marine life. Ocean fronts are dynamic in time and space, and are a key component to a comprehensive knowledge of ocean dynamics and aquatic ecosystems in relation to climate change. However, dynamic features such as fronts are difficult to study through conventional oceanographic techniques. In this paper, we build upon our previous work in sampling and tracking an ocean front based on predictions and/or priors. Specifically, given a prior (that may not be accurate or up-to-date) we present and experimentally validate a method for an autonomous surface or underwater vehicle to plan a mission and adapt this mission on-the-go to track a dynamic, but coherent, structure. Experimental results using a novel indoor testbed, capable of creating controllable fluidic features in an indoor laboratory setting, are presented. These results demonstrate that the vehicle is able to adapt its path to follow a desired, time-varying contour."
icra,None,Safe motion using viability kernels,"Mohamed A. Bouguerra,Thierry Fraichard,Mohamed Fezari,","A prerequisite to safe robot motion is to avoid Inevitable Collision States (ICS). However, the characterization of the ICS set is a challenge. Several approximation methods have been proposed, most of which either are overly conservative or fail to provide proper motion safety guarantees. In order to to improve safety guarantees, we build upon Viability Theory and adapt an algorithm designed to approximate the Viability Kernel, a concept similar to ICS. Our algorithm is applied first to a challenging static environment scenario. It is then extended to handle dynamic environments. Although it is not possible in general to ensure safety forever, we manage nonetheless to achieve infinite motion safety in two special cases."
icra,None,Decentralized smart sensor scheduling for multiple target tracking for border surveillance,"James Hare,Shalabh Gupta,James Wilson,","Border surveillance requires regular patrolling to prevent intruders from crossing across, emphasizing the need for an automated network of sensing devices that is capable of detecting and estimating multiple moving targets. This paper proposes a fusion-driven decentralized sensor scheduling scheme that enables dynamic space-time clustering around multiple moving targets for energy-efficient track estimation. Each sensor node runs a Probabilistic Finite State Automata (PFSA) that controls the sensing and communication devices in an energy-efficient manner. This decentralized scheduling scheme is validated and compared with traditional scheduling schemes. The results show that the proposed scheme conserves energy while maintaining accurate track estimation."
icra,None,A framework for infrastructure-free warehouse navigation,"Matthew Gadd,Paul Newman,","This paper presents a universally applicable graph-based framework for the navigation of warehouse robots equipped with only monocular cameras. We strongly advocate the use of relative pose information stored in a topological map, rather than a globally consistent metric representation of the environment. We show how multiple traversals of adjacent workspaces can be naturally “stitched” together in the course of a typical warehouse picking and shelving schedule to create a network of reusable paths in which the robot can efficiently localise and plan new routes. This allows us to command the robot to return to any of the previously visited locations not necessarily through the same route that we taught it. Unlike state-of-the-art teach and repeat systems using stereo vision, our approach exploits the strongly planar nature of the data obtained from a downward-facing camera, and creates odometric constraints by tracking the perceived texture of the floor and computing a simple homography. To demonstrate the robustness of our system, we validate our approach on datasets collected over a week-long period within a challenging and representative environment in the form of a warehouse shelving area."
icra,None,Connected invariant sets for high-speed motion planning in partially-known environments,"Daniel Althoff,Sebastian Scherer,","Ensuring safety in partially-known environments is a critical problem in robotics since the environment is perceived through sensors and the environment cannot be completely known ahead of time. Prior work has considered the problem of finding positive control invariant sets (PCIS). However, this approach limits the planning horizon of the motion planner since the PCIS must lie completely in the limited known part of the environment. Here we consider the problem of guaranteeing safety by ensuring the existence of at least one PCIS in partially-known environments leading to an extension of the PCIS concept. It is shown, that this novel method is less conservative than the common PCIS approach and robust to unknown small obstacles which might appear in the close vicinity of the robot. An example implementation for loiter circles and power line obstacles is presented. Simulation scenarios are used for validating the proposed concept."
icra,None,An approach to base placement for effective collaboration of multiple autonomous industrial robots,"Mahdi Hassan,Dikai Liu,Gavin Paul,Shoudong Huang,","There are many benefits for the deployment of multiple autonomous industrial robots to carry out a task, particularly if the robots act in a highly collaborative manner. Collaboration can be possible when each robot is able to autonomously explore the environment, localize itself, create a map of the environment and communicate with other robots. This paper presents an approach to the modeling of the collaboration problem of multiple robots determining optimal base positions and orientations in an environment by considering the team objectives and the information shared amongst the robots. It is assumed that the robots can communicate so as to share information on the environment, their operation status and their capabilities. The approach has been applied to a team of robots that are required to perform complete surface coverage tasks such as grit-blasting and spray painting in unstructured environments. Case studies of such applications are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."

Our strategy allows to improve the efficiency of a fleet of AGVs in terms of delivery time and its computational burden is sufficiently small to be embedded in standard industrial traffic management system. The algorithm is validated in a small-scale automatic warehouse with real AGVs.
icra,None,Affecting operator trust in intelligent multirobot surveillance systems,"Shameka Dawson,Chris Crawford,Edward Dillon,Monica Anderson,","Homeland safety and security will increasingly depend upon autonomous unmanned vehicles as a method of assessing and maintaining situational awareness. As autonomous team algorithms evolve toward requiring less human intervention, it may be that having an “operator-in-the-loop” becomes the ultimate goal in utilizing autonomous teams for surveillance. However studies have shown that trust plays a factor in how effectively an operator can work with autonomous teammates. In this work, we study mechanisms that look at autonomy as a system and not as the sum of individual actions. First, we conjecture that if the operator understands how the team autonomy is designed that the user would better trust that the system will contribute to the overall goal. Second, we focus on algorithm input criteria as being linked to operator perception and trust. We focus on adding a time-varying spatial projection of areas in the ROI that have been unseen for more than a set duration (STEC). Studies utilize a custom test bed that allows users to interact with a surveillance team to find a target in the region of interest. Results show that while algorithm training had an adverse effect, projecting salient team/surveillance state had a statistically significant impact on trust and did not negatively affect workload or performance. This result may point at a mechanism for improving trust through visualizing states as used in the autonomous algorithm."

The presented method provides a probabilistic model that integrates visual observations with feedback from manipulation actions to best characterize a distribution of possible articulation models. We evaluate several action selection methods to efficiently reduce the uncertainty about the articulation model. The full system is experimentally evaluated using a PR2 mobile manipulator. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system allows for intelligent reasoning about sparse, noisy data in a number of common manipulation scenarios."
icra,None,Minimalistic sensor design in visual-inertial structure from motion,"Agostino Martinelli,","This paper presents a theoretical investigation in the framework of visual-inertial sensor fusion and the results here provided are the extension of our previous contribution in [10], [11]. The general goal of this research is to establish minimalistic visual-inertial sensors settings, which still provide full information even in the most challenging situations, i.e., in the case of unknown camera extrinsic calibration, unknown magnitude of the gravity, unknown inertial sensor bias and when only a single point feature is available. The investigation here provided allows us to conclude that, even in the case of a single point feature, the information provided by a sensor suit composed by a monocular camera and two inertial sensors (along two independent axes and where at least one is an accelerometer) is the same as in the case of a complete inertial measurement unit (i.e., when the inertial sensors consist of three orthogonal accelerometers and three orthogonal gyroscopes). To derive this result, an observability analysis of systems with only one and two inertial sensors is performed. This analysis requires to approach an open problem in control theory, called the Unknown Input Observability (UIO). In this paper we adopt the same method introduced in [10], [11] to solve this UIO problem. The method has been here improved in order to deal with systems more complex than the ones analyzed in [10], [11]. The paper also provides a general discussion on UIO and in particular on the proposed solution."
icra,None,"A Power-Performance Approach to Comparing Sensor Families, with application to comparing neuromorphic to traditional vision sensors","Andrea Censi,Erich Mueller,Emilio Frazzoli,Stefano Soatto,","There is considerable freedom in choosing the sensors to be equipped on a robot. Currently many sensing technologies are available (radar, lidar, vision sensors, time-of-flight cameras, etc.). For each class, there are additional choices regarding the exact sensor parameters (spatial resolution, frame rate, etc.). Which sensor is best? In general, this question needs to be qualified. It depends on the task. In an estimation task, the answer depends on the prior for the signal. In a control task, the answer depends exactly on which are the sufficient statistics for computing the control signal. This paper shows that an ulterior qualification that needs to be made: the answer depends on the power available for sensing, even when the task is fixed. We define the “power-performance” curve as the performance attainable on a task for a given level of sensing power. We show that this approach is well suited to comparing a traditional CMOS sensor with the recently available “neuromorphic” sensors. We discuss estimation tasks with different priors for the signal. We find priors for which one sensor dominates the other and vice-versa, priors for which they are equivalent, and priors for which the answer depends on the power available. This shows that comparing sensors is a quite delicate problem. It also suggests that the optimal architecture might have more that one sensor, and would switch sensors on and off according to the performance level required instantaneously."
icra,None,Multisensor placement in 3D environments via visibility estimation and derivative-free optimization,"François-Michel De Rainville,Jean-Philippe Mercier,Christian Gagné,,,","This paper proposes a complete system for robotic sensor placement in initially unknown arbitrary three-dimensional environments. The system uses a novel approach for computing the quality of acquisition of a mobile sensor group in such environments. The quality of acquisition is based on a geometric model of a camera which allows accurate sensor models and simple occlusion computation. The proposed system combines this new metric with a global derivative-free optimization algorithm to find simultaneously the number of sensors and their configuration to sense accordingly the environment. The presented framework compares favourably with current techniques working in two-dimensional environments. Furthermore, simulation and experimental results demonstrate the ability of the system to cope with full three-dimensional environments, a domain still unexplored by previous methods."
icra,None,Sensitivity study for object reconstruction using a network of time-of-flight depth sensors,"George Xu,Shahram Payandeh,","This paper investigates the integration of multiple time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors for object reconstruction. The advantage of such a sensor network is in the increased viewing coverage and addressing the problem of object self-occlusion. However, in utilizing a network of depth sensors, calibration and interference between the sensors can be one of the key challenges of their effective utilization. In comparison with infrared depth sensors, integration of time-of-flight sensors offer some new challenges. This paper presents experimental studies of practical factors that can affect such integration and proposes a guideline which can be used to avoid interferences. Using the proposed set-up, the paper also presents a method which can be used for reconstructing objects in such a sensor network."
icra,None,Battery-aware dynamical modeling and identification for the total thrust in multi-rotor UAVs using only an onboard accelerometer,"Nicolas Staub,Antonio Franchi,","We propose and experimentally validate a new class of models for the total thrust generation in multi-rotor UAVs which is suitable for low- and middle-end platforms. Differently from typical models assuming to instantaneously control the rotor spinning velocity, in the proposed class we consider that the total thrust has its own dynamics and its final value explicitly depends both on the pseudo-setpoint commands given to the motor driver and the measurement of the battery terminal voltage. We compare the different model instances within the class using a principled experimental setup in which the total thrust is precisely measured using a motion capture system as ground truth, instead of relying on a setup based or noise-prone force sensors. We then show that the use of a dynamical model that includes also the battery terminal voltage significantly improves the prediction ability of the model in terms of accuracy. Finally we show how the proposed model can be identified using on-board only acceleration measurements, achieving a surprisingly good accuracy when compared with the ground truth case. We expect that the use of the proposed model will be important both in case of precise flight control and in the case of aerial physical interactive tasks."
icra,None,Temporal smearing compensation in reverberant environment for speech-based human-robot interaction,"Randy Gomez,Keisuke Nakamura,Takeshi Mizumoto,Kazuhiro Nakadai,","Speech-based human-robot interaction is often plagued with issues such as reverberation and changes in speaker position that impacts overall performance. In this paper, we show a method in compensating the joint effects of reverberation and the change in speaker position. The acoustic perturbation caused by these two takes its toll on the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and then the Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). Consequently, these will lead to a failure in the human-robot interaction experience. The proposed method is specifically designed to address the challenging environment condition in which robots are deployed. First, we analyze the impact of reverberation in the form of temporal smearing per change in speaker position. Then, we extract the smearing coefficients that capture the joint dynamics between the speech signal at current position and the room acoustics as observed by the robot. These coefficients are utilized to update the room transfer function (RTF) and the suppression parameters are stored offline. Moreover, all of these processes are optimized in the context of the ASR system for robot application. In the online mode, the reverberant data at an arbitrary position is processed using the parameters pre-computed offline. This effectively compensates the joint effects of reverberation at the arbitrary speaker position. Experimental results using real data gathered in a human-robot communication setting show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods."
icra,None,On-the-spot calibration of microphone array Transfer Functions for robot audition,"Keisuke Nakamura,Surya Ambrose,Kazuhiro Nakadai,","This paper investigates the calibration of a microphone array based robot audition system, namely calibration of microphone array Transfer Functions (TFs). There are mainly two methods to obtain TFs: geometrical calculation and measurement. The geometrical calculation has difficulty in simulating robot- and room-acoustics such as diffraction and reflection properties of a robot's body and a room, and the measurement is accurate but time-consuming and requires expertise on acoustics. Thus, we propose fast and simple on-the-spot calibration of TFs including robot- and room-acoustics. The proposed approach first estimates microphone location and clock-difference by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) using hand clap acoustic signals while a human is walking around a robot. Second, TFs with robot- and room-acoustics are estimated by hand clap acoustic signals and interpolated so that the TFs can be roundly arranged at regular intervals in an online manner. In the evaluation, we calibrated TFs only by 20 hand claps (took only 20 seconds), and the TFs showed considerable improvements in sound source localization and separation compared to geometrically calculated TFs and achieved comparable performance towards the measured TFs which are calibrated by approximately 60 minute recordings."

The knowledge of such a value is a milestone in the development of active security devices, or at least a mean to inform the driver about the longitudinal stability of his vehicle. Indeed, these vehicles are frequently subject to ground changes and high slopes, causing fatal losses of control - slipping, rollover, etc. - every year. The observer has been tested and validated on a grape harvester in various conditions and its output evaluated with respect to an estimation based on expensive but precise sensors. These experimental results show that the driver can be informed in real-time about the longitudinal stability of his vehicle and alerted about critical situations."

Yano,T. Takahashi,","In vehicle performance tests, fuel consumption, the components of exhaust gas, and mileage are measured on a chassis dynamometer that simulates the road load. It is difficult even for a professional driver to maintain speeds within the tolerance band of driving test cycles. Thus, there has long been an expectation that robotic drivers will be able to test vehicle performance with high reproducibility. In previous studies of robotic drivers, the improvement of tracking performance has been studied for each driving test cycle. In this study, we proposed a control system for realizing a driving test with smooth pedal use and low fuel consumption. We derived a set reference speed profile within a tolerance band from a driving test cycle standard. First, we performed a vehicle pre-test with a professional driver. From this driving test, we found that the square value of the power consumed by the vehicle was effective for driving with smooth pedal operation. Therefore, we proposed an objective function considering the square value of the power. We then derived the reference speed in a driving test cycle tolerance band for the robotic driver by the proposed method. Finally, we performed the vehicle test using the robotic driver. In the test, we used a standard JC08 chassis dynamometer, a moving averaged JC08 waveform, and the proposed speed waveform. We made sure that the proposed system was effective using the results of the actual vehicle tests."

The method uses an active contours approach and superellipse a-priori knowledge to segment the image in object, object-shadow and background areas. In contrast to other methods using superellipse constraints, the shape prior is incorporated directly into the segmentation process. This kind of segmentation has the advantage that afterwards the extracted superellipse parameters that describe the object and the object-shadow can directly be used as feature for a classification - this work is hence also of potential interest for general object recognition tasks in other application domains. Several different perspectives of implementing this idea into a suitable algorithm are introduced and compared with each other. Thus, for the evaluation of each method the extracted superellipse features are used for a support vector machine classification. An one against all confusion matrix is generated on a test data set. This result is compared to a related state of the art algorithm. It is shown that our new method is able to correctly classify 170 of 210 objects in a very challenging real world data set and that it yields significant better results than the state of the art comparison."

Every next position is computed by employing environment inference on top of path planning. The path planning process that ensures obstacle avoidance uses a modified version of the A* algorithm [1] and the inference is performed by direct sensing and by predicting values at yet-not-visited positions using Gaussian processes. We have validated our algorithm with densely measured data of an indoor magnetic field with significant spatial variations in different obstacle setups. Additionally, it is shown that it outperforms a previously developed algorithm [2], for obstacle-free scenarios, and the random movement of the agent."

When sensor data is obtained from multiple sets of noisy measurements at differing resolutions, the problem of compounding this information together to provide an effective and efficient means of mapping is not trivial, particularly as the size of the environment increases. In this paper, we propose a general framework for integrating heterogeneous sensor data to obtain large-scale 2.5D probabilistic maps. Gaussian Processes are used to generate a prior map that learns the spatial correlation between nearby points. Bayesian data fusion is then employed to update these prior maps with new measurements from distinct sensor modalities. In order to deal with large scale data, a novel submapping strategy is introduced to perform the fusion step efficiently in dealing with large covariance matrices. Submaps are first marginalised from the learned correlated prior and then updated based on the property of conditional independence. Most notably, the technique lends itself to generate accurate estimates at arbitrary resolutions and is able to handle varying noise from disparate sensor sources. The framework is applied to pipeline thickness mapping, with experimental results in fusing a high-resolution sensor and a low-resolution sensor showing the ability of the proposed technique to capture spatial correlations to come up with more accurate results when compared with a naïve fusion approach."

This study presents a Task Swap Allocation (TSA) algorithm that increases vehicle allocation with respect to the state-of-the-art consensus-based bundle algorithm and one of its extensions, while meeting time constraints. The novel idea is to enable an online reconfiguration of task allocation among distributed and networked vehicles. The proposed strategy reallocates tasks among vehicles to create feasible spaces for unallocated tasks, thereby optimizing the total number of allocated tasks. The algorithm is shown to be efficient with respect to previous methods because changes are made to a task list only once a suitable space in a schedule has been identified. Furthermore, the proposed TSA can be employed as an extension for other distributed task allocation algorithms with similar constraints to improve performance by escaping local optima and by reacting to dynamic environments."

The robots have limited and noisy sensing capabilities and no metric or global information available to them. Using tools from algebraic topology, we formally describe the sensor coverage as a simplicial complex, deploy robots through the complex using bearing-based local controllers, and attain coverage while identifying and removing sensor redundancies. Despite the highly limited sensing capabilities and complete lack of global localization and metric information, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is complete, always terminates in a finite-sized environment, is guaranteed to attain complete coverage and is robust to sensor failures. The algorithm presented in this paper was demonstrated through simulation and proves to effectively cover and explore unknown indoor environments."

Duncan,Robin R. Murphy,","This work provides a case study of both fixed-wing and rotorcraft small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS) used in a deployment at the SR530 mudslides in Washington state and compares the types of flight paths used by each vehicle type. Previously aerial imagery from SUAS have produced 2D and 3D reconstructions of simple terrain, but have not been used in complex terrain which encompasses both flat areas and drastic changes in the height of ground level, such as a mudslide. In this deployment, both types of SUAS platforms were used to collect imagery over terrain varied nearly 200m in elevation but different paths were used due to the complexity of the terrain, safety, privacy, and platform-specific limitations. The deployment found that paths with fixed-wing platforms can be thought of as stacked horizontal planes while rotorcraft can cover complex terrain with a set of vertical planes. The different paths contribute to autonomous path planning, particularly to accommodate vertical planes, and to general understanding of how different SUAS can be applied to challenging terrains. Future work in path planning should incorporate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) information to facilitate flight paths in vertical planes and to maintain altitude restrictions relative to radically changing elevations of a landscape."

In this work, we initially propose a scheduling scheme for a single grain cart to unload multiple combine harvesters without any interruption in the activity of the combines.

Our approach models the agent's behavior using a collection of randomized simulators called implicit agent models and seeks to classify the agent according to which of these models is believed to be governing its motions. To accomplish this, we introduce an algorithm whose input is an observation sequence generated by the agent, represented as sensor label-time pairs, along with an observation sequence generated by one of our implicit agent models and whose output is a measure of the similarity between the two observation sequences. Using this similarity measure, we propose two algorithms for the model classification problem: one based on a weighted voting scheme and one that uses intermediate resampling steps. We have implemented these algorithms in simulation, and present results demonstrating their effectiveness in correctly classifying mobile agents."

Silva,","Target tracking with bearing-only sensors is a challenging problem when the target moves dynamically in complex scenarios. Besides the partial observability of such sensors, they have limited field of views, occlusions can occur, etc. In those cases, cooperative approaches with multiple tracking robots are interesting, but the different sources of uncertain information need to be considered appropriately in order to achieve better estimates. Even though there exist probabilistic filters that can estimate the position of a target dealing with uncertainties, bearing-only measurements bring usually additional problems with initialization and data association. In this paper, we propose a multi-robot triangulation method with a dynamic baseline that can triangulate bearing-only measurements in a probabilistic manner to produce 3D observations. This method is combined with a decentralized stochastic filter and used to tackle those initialization and data association issues. The approach is validated with simulations and field experiments where a team of aerial and ground robots with cameras track a dynamic target."

The ADL are then used to detect deviations in a person's behaviour. Indoor localization based on the fusion of heterogeneous data from different sensors, is then essential for ADL characterization. For this purpose, a robust data fusion method is presented in this work through a multi-modal analysis to monitor the activities of elderly people (immobility, walking, etc) in a smart home. The paper describes the installation of sensors in a Living Lab and the preliminary experimental results using a set of Pyroelectric Infra Red (PIR) sensors, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) distance measurement and the outcome of a noise analysis. Within a set-membership framework, our algorithm for robust localization employs a multi-modal data fusion approach dealing with faulty measurements."

Some sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, must be physically installed in soft soil, yet UAVs cannot easily determine soil softness with remote sensors. In this paper, we use data from an onboard accelerometer measured during UAV landings to determine the softness of the ground. We collect and analyze over 200 data sets gathered from 8 different materials: foam, carpet, wood, tile, grass, dirt, concrete, and woodchips. Based on this analysis, we examine a number of features from the accelerometer and four classification algorithms: LDA, QDA, SVM, and binary decision trees. The decision tree performs well and is simple to implement onboard the UAV. We implement this in our UAV control system and perform experiments to verify that the UAV can accurately classify the softness of the surface with 90% accuracy. This lays the groundwork for our future work on developing a UAV capable of installing sensors in soft soil."

The key novelty of this system is the coupling of a volumetric occupancy map with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously done. This architecture allows us to train an extremely efficient and highly accurate system for detection tasks from raw occupancy data. We apply this method to the problem of detecting safe landing zones for autonomous helicopters from LiDAR point clouds. Current methods for this problem rely on heuristic rules and use simple geometric features. These heuristics break down in the presence of low vegetation, as they do not distinguish between vegetation that may be landed on and solid objects that should be avoided. We evaluate the system with a combination of real and synthetic range data. We show our system outperforms various benchmarks, including a system integrating various hand-crafted point cloud features from the literature."

Range sensors moving in a fixed pattern are commonly used as sensing modalities on mobile robots. The performance of these sensors can be augmented by actively controlling their configuration for minimizing the expected cost of the mission. The related information gain problem in NP hard. Current methodologies are either computationally too expensive to run online or make simplifying assumptions that fail in complex environments. We present a method to create and learn a policy that maps features calculated online to sensory actions. The policy developed in this work actively controls a nodding lidar to keep the vehicle safe at high velocities and focuses the sensor bandwidth on gaining information relevant for the mission once safety is ensured. It is validated and evaluated on an autonomous full-scale helicopter (Boeing Unmanned Little Bird) equipped with an actively controlled nodding laser. It is able to keep the vehicle safe at its maximum operating velocity, 56 m=s, and reduce the landing zone evaluation time by 500% as compared to passive nodding. The structure of the policy and efficient learning algorithm should generalize to provide a solution for actively controlling a sensor for keeping a mobile robots safe while exploring regions of interest to the robot."

These advances combined with the growing popularity of Micro Aerial Vehicles as an autonomous imaging platform, have made 3D vision tools ubiquitous for large number of Architecture, Engineering and Construction applications among audiences, mostly unskilled in computer vision. However, to obtain high-resolution and accurate reconstructions from a large-scale object using SfM, there are many critical constraints on the quality of image data, which often become sources of inaccuracy as the current 3D reconstruction pipelines do not facilitate the users to determine the fidelity of input data during the image acquisition. In this paper, we present and advocate a closed-loop interactive approach that performs incremental reconstruction in real-time and gives users an online feedback about the quality parameters like Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), image redundancy, etc on a surface mesh. We also propose a novel multi-scale camera network design to prevent scene drift caused by incremental map building, and release the first multi-scale image sequence dataset as a benchmark. Further, we evaluate our system on real outdoor scenes, and show that our interactive pipeline combined with a multi-scale camera network approach provides compelling accuracy in multi-view reconstruction tasks when compared against the state-of-the-art methods."

The sensor was patterned to stripe-shape in the polydimethylsiloxane using photofabrication and molding technique. Oxygen concentration around the oocyte was distributed according to spherical diffusion theory because of similar oxygen permeability of polydimethylsiloxane and that of medium. The sensor array detects two-dimensional distribution of oxygen concentration and oxygen consumption ratio of the oocyte is calculated by image processing and Fick's low.

To enhance the maneuverability, an AFM can be modified and its cantilever can be controlled as a robotic end-effector. To precisely control the nanorobots, their scanners inherent hysteresis, which is the main disadvantage, should be compensated sufficiently. Mostly, hysteresis compensators used in AFM control system only employ the symmetric models, which cannot well represent the asymmetric hysteresis phenomena of piezo-scanners. However, under many cases, the smart material based scanners possess asymmetric hysteresis slightly or seriously, which is far more complex than the regular symmetric case; in addition, for commercial or customized AFMs, the scanners are usually controlled without feedback. These drawbacks tackle further improvement of positioning accuracy of AFM systems. To effectively describe and further reduce the hysteresis of general cases, we propose a new type of generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator based superposition model, named unparallel PI (UPI) model. The flexible edge of the UPI operator can be tilted freely within a defined range, which enables it to capture asymmetric hysteresis efficiently. To cancel the hysteresis effect in an open-loop system, three inverse compensation approaches are proposed, compared, and the corresponding stability is analyzed. Experiments with AFM based nanorobot verified the proposed approaches with convincing performance."

The magnetized T. pyriformis cells are generated by adding iron-oxide spherical particles into the cells. We control the cells' moving direction by changing the magnetic field direction. Based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm, we define a cost function which is composed of the target cost function and the obstacle potential function. The target cost function is to measure the sum of differences between cells' predicted positions and their target positions. The obstacle potential function is used to measure the repulsive force of the obstacle. The input variables of the cost function are the sequence of control signals. We use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to find a cost value which is close to the global minimum of the cost function. In the experimental result section, we show the control of three m3pi robots to move from their initial positions to their target positions with avoiding the obstacle. Since the similar control strategy has successfully controlled one T. pyriformis cell in our previous work, we believe our PSO-MPC algorithm is applicable on the multiple T. pyriformis cells' control task."

In order to improve robots control, robustness and efficiency, real time 3D topographical surface analysis are essential especially for their navigation under such wet and confined environments. In this paper we propose a swimmer from the Roll-To-Swim (RTS) family capable of detecting and characterizing its surrounding topography thanks to 2D optical feedback. This RTS detects the presence of an obstacle (6.5μm height) by detecting perturbations in its horizontal rolling motion. Then we reconstruct a 2D probabilistic map of obstacles presence. To further characterize the surface topography, we developed the spintop motion where the RTS stands vertically while rotating. We provide a speed characterization of this new motion and demonstrate its maneuverability by integrating it in a closed-loop path following control. In this motion, RTS can be trapped by a targeted obstacle. The amount of power needed to escape is used to characterize the height of the obstacle from 2.5 to 6.5μm with a precision of 2μm. This wireless topographical detection by RTS can be a promising tool to choose an efficient pathway and an appropriate motion adapted to the surrounding environment as well as a surface topography analyzer."

Currently, the multicell transportation in practical applications is implemented manually, with low precision and efficiency. This paper presents a swarm-inspired approach to automated transportation of multiple cells using robotically controlled optical tweezers. A swarming controller, where holographic optical tweezers function as end-effectors to manipulate the cells, was developed. To ensure that the cells do not escape from the optical traps, the controller was designed by incorporating a saturation control of the cell offset to the laser center. Because the optical tweezers can only be position-controlled, oscillation may easily occur. This problem was solved by integrating artificial first-order kinematics of the optical tweezers into the controller design. Experiments of transporting multiple yeast cells were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Especially, the thrust capability of the microjet is outstanding compared with the other microsystems, but remains only partially understood. Studies have identified the internal precursory mechanisms of the propulsion of the microjet: its inner wall catalyzes the dismutation of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, and an oxygen bubble is then formed and migrates towards its widest opening. This impulses the propulsion of the microjet towards the opposite direction. However, the precise propellant role of the liquid surrounding the jet remains misunderstood. The same goes for the inner wall of the vessel in which the jet navigates, especially in narrowed environment. This article discusses these aspects in a simplified theoretical framework. Calculations are performed by explicit computation of Navier-Stokes equations. The obtained theoretical outcome are in good agreement with experimental results in the literature."

Under simplifying assumptions on the geometry of the source, sensors, and surrounding environment, and with knowledge of the source's trajectory, it is shown that the optimal control problem admits an intuitive, analytic closed-form solution. This is facilitated by the availability of analytic expressions for bounds on the probabilities of detection and false alarm during a Neyman-Pearson detection test. The intuition derived from this analytic solution leads to a motion control law that steers suboptimally the sensors to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the suspected source, while navigating among stationary obstacles in their environment, making a step closer to a practical physical implementation."

These disturbances pose a control challenge because resulting drift induces uncertainty and changes in the robot's speed and direction. This paper presents an online control policy based on supervised machine learning, Least Squares Axial Sum Policy Approximation (LSAPA), that generates trajectories for robotic preference-balancing tasks under stochastic disturbances. The task is learned offline with reinforcement learning, assuming no disturbances, and then trajectories are planned online in the presence of disturbances using the current observed information. We model the robot as a stochastic control-affine system with unknown dynamics impacted by a Gaussian process, and the task as a continuous Markov Decision Process. Replacing a traditional greedy policy, LSAPA works for high-dimensional control-affine systems impacted by stochastic disturbances and is linear in the input dimensionality. We verify the method for Swing-free Aerial Cargo Delivery and Rendezvous tasks. Results show that LSAPA selects an input an order of magnitude faster than comparative methods, rejecting a range of stochastic disturbances. Further, experiments on a quadrotor demonstrate that LSAPA trajectories that are suitable for physical systems."

The via-point formulation allows for a sparse movement representation which is inherently smooth according to a minimum jerk criterion. In this research we focus on two aspects. First, we present an initialization method to find a feasible number of via-points and their distribution in time. This initialization takes the difficulty of the planning problem into account and finds a tradeoff between representation complexity (number of via-points) and optimization time. Second, we propose a two-step optimization approach to improve the via-point parameters to satisfy constraints over the whole motion duration. We show that our methods generate feasible and smooth robot motions with a high success rate for tasks of varying complexity. The methods are evaluated in simulation using four different scenarios with two different robots, a 7-DOF robot arm and a 16-DOF humanoid upper body.

Hence, the robot can be taught to make use of all its degrees-of-freedom (DoF) to adapt its behavior to new dynamic scenarios. In order to achieve this goal we propose an incremental learning approach in a framework of kinesthetic teaching based on a multi-priority kinematic controller, the so-called Task Transition Control (TTC). The learning algorithm is responsible for skill acquisition and their incremental update. On the real-time level, end-effector and null-space motion primitives, as well as the physical guidance are considered as prioritized tasks. The transitions among these tasks and their insertion and removal are managed by the TTC according to the specified transition parameters.

One of the major challenges arises from the high dimensionality inherent in planning foot placements coupled with center of mass motion along terrains that are multifaceted and highly diverse. Previous work has resolved these issues to an extent by constraining the center of mass to fixed trajectories or using predetermined foot placements. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a new set of strategies: (1) an optimized geometric Hermite curve with minimum curvature and length is used to plan the motion of the center of mass (2) single contact model dynamics for state-space approximations of center of mass behavior are used to resolve feet transitions between steps in planar environments and (3) vertical center of mass phase space trajectories are optimized to produce an overall plan with minimum energy. This framework allows us to synthesize complex maneuvers in rough terrains and to develop optimal contact transition and foot placement plans that consider the robot's configuration and constraints. Experimental results show that for any potential locations of foot contacts, our planner generates smooth and optimal trajectories for center of mass motion as well as a minimum energy plan for transitioning between foot placements."

Our recent work on prioritized optimal control merges the advantages of both these methods. This paper reformulates the original prioritized optimal control algorithm with the precise goal of improving its computational speed. We extend the dynamic programming method to work with a hierarchy of tasks. We compared our approach in simulation with both our previous algorithm and classical optimal control.

Thus, the method does not require any specific pattern, which turns the calibration process fast and simpler to perform. The estimated relative pose has proven to be also very precise since it uses two different types of constraints, line-to-plane and point-to-plane, as a result of a richer configuration than previous proposals that relies on plane or V-shaped patterns.

A crucial part of the scientific method is to perform experiments that can be replicated by other researchers in order to compare different results. In light of this fact, this paper presents a thorough comparison of 3D scan registration algorithms using a recently published benchmark protocol which makes use of a publicly available challenging data set that covers a wide range of environments. In particular, we evaluate two types of recent 3D registration algorithms - one local and one global. Both approaches take local surface structure into account, rather than matching individual points. After well over 100 000 individual tests, we conclude that algorithms using the normal distributions transform (NDT) provides accurate results compared to a modern implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) method, when faced with scan data that has little overlap and weak geometric structure. We also demonstrate that the minimally uncertain maximum consensus (MUMC) algorithm provides accurate results in structured environments without needing an initial guess, and that it provides useful measures to detect whether it has succeeded or not. We also propose two amendments to the experimental protocol, in order to provide more valuable results in future implementations."

The place recognition and relocalization problem is more challenging in the underwater environment mainly due to three factors: 1) changes in illumination; 2) long-term changes in the visual appearance of features because of phenomena like biofouling on man-made structures and growth or movement in natural features; and 3) low density of visually salient features for image matching. To address these challenges, a patch-based feature matching approach is proposed, which uses image segmentation and local intensity contrast to locate salient patches and HOG description to make correspondences between patches. Compared to traditional point-based features that are sensitive to dramatic appearance changes underwater, patch-based features are able to encode higher level information such as shape or structure which tends to persist across years in underwater environments. The algorithm is evaluated on real data, from multiple years, collected by a Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for ship hull inspection. Results in relocalization performance across missions from different years are compared to other traditional methods."

In literature, there are few numerical methods for the finger placement of human-inspired robotic hands. In particular, there are no numerical methods, for the thumb placement, that aim to improve the hand dexterity and grasping capabilities by keeping the hand design close to the human one. While existing models are usually the result of successive parameter adjustments, the proposed method determines the fingers placements by mean of empirical tests. Moreover, a surgery test and the workspace analysis of the whole hand are used to find the best thumb position and orientation according to the hand kinematics and structure. The result is validated through simulation where it is checked that the hand looks well balanced and that it meets our constraints and needs. The presented method provides a numerical tool which allows the easy computation of finger and thumb geometries and base placements for a human-like dexterous robotic hand."

Micaelli,M. Grossard,M. Makarov,P. Rodriguez-Ayerbe,,","This paper presents a new control scheme for dexterous manipulation of an object by a multifingered hand. The effects of the uncertainties on the contact orientation and location are investigated and taken into account in the control design, allowing to manipulate the object robustly. The control law has three main objectives: (i) ensuring the motion control of the object, (ii) satisfying the constraints of the manipulation system, and (iii) being robust to the uncertainties on the contact point. The proposed control is based on a state feedback architecture with robust pole placement by an LMI approach. The controller is designed offline and can be related to an object-level impedance controller. The constraints of the manipulation system, e.g. the friction constraints, are taken into account with an additional control action, based on an online LMI evaluation. Simulation results are presented and demonstrate that the proposed control law ensures the three main objectives."

Mason,","Pivoting is the rotation of an object between two fingers using gravity and inertial forces to impart angular momentum. We present an analysis of the mechanics of pivoting and a framework for planning and execution. Extrinsic dexterity was defined by Chavan-Dafle et al. [1] as the use of external forces, such as gravity and inertial forces in post grasp manipulation. We analyze one such regrasp termed “pivoting” by Rao et al. [2]. We find a grasp and arm trajectory which can rotate an object between stable poses, if any. We demonstrate an implementation of pivoting with an ABB industrial arm and a two fingered gripper."

Recognizing and exploiting these degrees of freedom in the context of non-rigid objects poses challenges that are significantly different from the rigid case. As a major generic subtask, we consider the identification and exploitation of boundary components during clothes manipulation, combining RGBD vision with uni- and bi-manual handling through a robot. Specifically, we present a novel graph-based approach to detecting boundary components by extracting closed contours from depth images. Based on that, we suggest a planner minimizing a heuristic energy function for an optimal grasp pose of a robot hand around the boundary of a garment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in interactive perception and regrasping experiments with a dual arm and two attached anthropomorphic hands. Furthermore, we show how to make use of these capabilities to implement a basic skill for a coat-check robot: hanging up a knit cap on a hat-stand."
icra,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7139711,Characterizing device dynamics for haptic manipulation and navigation,"Colin Gallacher,James Harrison,József Kövecses,","In this work we present a method of systematically selecting regions of a haptic workspace to be used for navigation of large virtual environments. Existing navigational techniques require the partitioning of the workspace into a region of manipulation and a separate region for navigation tasks. These techniques, however, have neglected to describe an effective way to implement these concepts in a device specific manner. We propose a two step technique to define these regions based on the mechanical properties of pre-existing devices. In the first step, the kinematic properties of the device are analyzed across the entirety of the physical workspace. A well-behaved region that favours isotropic mapping from the joint actuators to the generalized forces at the end effector is selected. Having ensured high force fidelity within this region, we then perform a second step analyzing the device dynamic properties. We further subdivide the navigational space into a region with suitable inertial properties in which manipulation tasks may be performed. This procedure generates a haptic display with a highly transparent haptic manipulation region within which a user can interact with a virtual environment. This manipulation region is bounded by a well-behaved navigational region that ensures adequate force transmission. To demonstrate this technique, navigation and manipulation spaces are generated and described for the planar and spatial cases."
icra,None,Planning finger movements to lift up deformable 2D objects,"Feng Guo,Yan-Bin Jia,","This paper describes a strategy to lift up a deformable 2D object resting on a horizontal plane. Inspired by human hand lifting behavior, the strategy plans grasping trajectories of two fingertips using modified Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). Compared to a straight squeeze, a planned finger movement not only enlarges the graspable region, but also minimizes the work. Improvements on control complexity and robustness are made through modifications to RRT. The introduced strategy is applicable to both hollow and solid 2D objects, and is extendable to 3D ones."
icra,None,Exploiting symmetries and extrusions for grasping household objects,"Ana Huamán Quispe,Benoît Milville,Marco A. Gutiérrez,Can Erdogan,,,,","In this paper we present an approach for creating complete shape representations from a single depth image for robot grasping. We introduce algorithms for completing partial point clouds based on the analysis of symmetry and extrusion patterns in observed shapes. Identified patterns are used to generate a complete mesh of the object, which is, in turn, used for grasp planning. The approach allows robots to predict the shape of objects and include invisible regions into the grasp planning step. We show that the identification of shape patterns, such as extrusions, can be used for fast generation and optimization of grasps. Finally, we present experiments performed with our humanoid robot executing pick-up tasks based on single depth images and discuss the applications and shortcomings of our approach."
icra,None,State estimation for dynamic systems with intermittent contact,"Shuai Li,Siwei Lyu,Jeff Trinkle,","Dynamic system states estimation, such as object pose and contact states estimation, is essential for robots to perform manipulation tasks. In order to make accurate estimation, the state transition model needs to be physically correct. Complementarity formulations of the dynamics are widely used for describing rigid body physical behaviors in the simulation field, which makes it a good state transition model for dynamic system states estimation problem. However, the non-smoothness of complementarity models and the high dimensionality of the dynamic system make the estimation problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a particle filtering framework that solves the estimation problem by sampling the discrete contact states using contact graphs and collision detection algorithms, and by estimating the continuous states through a Kalman filter. This method exploits the piecewise continuous property of complementarity problems and reduces the dimension of the sampling space compared with sampling the high dimensional continuous states space. We demonstrate that this method makes stable and reliable estimation in physical experiments."
icra,None,Modular snake robot velocity for side-winding gaits,"Kamilo Melo,","This paper considers a kinematic model that captures the speed and heading angle of a modular snake robot performing side-winding gaits. Modular snake robot locomotion is controlled in joint space. Consequently, the motion is achieved by continuous changes of the robot's body shape. In light of this behavior, this work describes a method to determine the position and orientation of a floating frame of reference to capture the robot's attitude in real-time, while executing side-winding gaits. A simple velocity model based on ground static contacts that determine the magnitude and direction of the robot's motion is proposed based on that frame. This model is validated by comparisons with experiments. The benefit of the proposed floating frame formulation and the velocity model for side-winding gaits depends on the fact that their calculation relied only in the gait control parameters, hence they could be determined analytically on-line."
icra,None,Analysis of rectilinear motion of a three-segment snake robot under action of dry friction,"Wenbin Tang,Shugen Ma,","Snakes and worms are capable of travelling along a straight line on a resistance medium using rectilinear locomotion. To apply this kind of gait in snake-inspired robots, some fundamental properties remain elusive. In this paper, we study the directional migration of a three-segment self-propelled system on a rough horizontal surface with Coulomb's dry friction. We elucidate the possibility that the system achieves directional migration through the propagation of extension and contraction wave. The necessary and sufficient conditions are certified to insure that the system is able to start from the state of rest. To analyze the approximately steady-state motion of the system, we provide explicit formulas for the mean velocity of the whole system by method of averaging. It is confirmed that for isotropic friction, the average speed and direction of the motion can be excited controlled."
icra,None,Incorporating frictional anisotropy in the design of a robotic snake through the exploitation of scales,"Miguel M. Serrano,Alexander H. Chang,Guangcong Zhang,Patricio A. Vela,","The scales on the skin of a snake are an integral part of the snake's locomotive capabilities. It stands to reason that the integration of scales into the design of robotic snakes would open new properties to exploit. In this work, we present a robotic snake design that incorporates rigid scales in the casing of each module. To validate the impact of the scales, locomotion is tested under three conditions: with scales, covered in cloth with scales, and covered in cloth without scales. The performance of the snake robot, in each of the aforementioned scenarios, is evaluated based on its forward displacement while executing each of two pre-programmed gaits: inchworm and lateral undulation. The lateral undulation gait is tested under two additional conditions: pitched and un-pitched. Tracks of the experimental runs are presented followed by a statistical analysis demonstrating an increase in locomotive performance when incorporating scales in the chassis design."
icra,None,Locomotive reduction for snake robots,"Xuesu Xiao,Ellen Cappo,Weikun Zhen,Jin Dai,Ke Sun,Chaohui Gong,,,","Limbless locomotion, evidenced by both biological and robotic snakes, capitalizes on these systems' redundant degrees of freedom to negotiate complicated environments. While the versatility of locomotion methods provided by a snake-like form is of great advantage, the difficulties in both representing the high dimensional workspace configuration and implementing the desired translations and orientations makes difficult further development of autonomous behaviors for snake robots. Based on a previously defined average body frame and set of motion primitives, this work proposes locomotive reduction, a simplifying methodology which reduces the complexity of controlling a redundant snake robot to that of navigating a differential-drive vehicle. We verify this technique by controlling a 16-DOF snake robot using locomotive reduction combined with a visual tracking system. The simplicity resulting from the proposed locomotive reduction method allows users to apply established autonomous navigation techniques previously developed for differential-drive cars to snake robots. Best of all, locomotive reduction preserves the advantages of a snake robot's ability to perform a variety of locomotion modes when facing complicated mobility challenges."
icra,None,Modeling rolling gaits of a snake robot,"Weikun Zhen,Chaohui Gong,Howie Choset,","Successful deployment of a snake robot in search and rescue tasks requires the capability of generating controls which can adapt to unknown environments in real-time. However, available motion generation techniques can be computationally expensive and lack the ability to adapt to the surroundings. This work considers modeling the rolling motion of a snake robot by applying the Bellows model with computation reduction techniques. One benefit of this is that controllers are defined with physically meaningful parameters, which in turn allows for higher level control of the robot. Another benefit is that it allows controllers to be defined by “composing shapes”, which enables developing controllers that can adapt to the surroundings. Using shape composition, we implemented a novel gait, named rolling hump, which forms a contour-fitting hump to negotiate obstacles. The efficacy of a snake robot climbing over obstacles by using the rolling hump is experimentally evaluated. An autonomous control strategy is presented and realized in simulation."
icra,None,Limbless locomotors that turn in place,"Chaohui Gong,Matthew Travers,Henry C. Astley,Daniel I. Goldman,,","Our research group has started a collaboration that analyzes data collected from biological snakes to provide insight on how to better program snake robots. Most data collected on biological snakes views the snakes from above and thus can only detect motion in the horizontal plane. However, both our robots and biological snakes are capable of generating motions both in the horizontal and vertical planes. Vertical waves naturally play a major role in limbless locomotion in that they simultaneously provide thrust motion and make-and-break contact between the mechanism and environment. Analysis on the data, collected from sidewinder rattle snakes, revealed that disparate modes of locomotion emerged from different contact patterns. We conclude that the same horizontal undulation can cause dramatically different motions for both the biological and robotic snakes depending upon the choice of contacts. With this knowledge, we introduce contact scheduling, a technique that plans positions of contacts along the body to design gaits for snake robots. Contact scheduling results in a novel turning gait, which can reorient a snake robot more than 90 degrees in one gait cycle."
icra,None,Spatial kinematic modeling of a long and thin continuum robotic cable,"Manas M. Tonapi,Isuru S. Godage,Amith M. Vijaykumar,Ian D. Walker,","In this paper, we present a new forward kinematic model for a novel class of long and thin continuum robots for operation in spatial workspace. Such robots are well suited for navigation through unstructured environments with superior reach using their flexible and thin profile, especially for inspection applications. This cable-like continuum robot design [1] has a concentric backbone arrangement but is spring-loaded and tendon-actuated, has improved compliance with a light and compact motor-encoder actuation mechanism. To account for the spring-loading, a compression factor is introduced on top of the established constant curvature continuum kinematics. The resulting continuum or shape variables are then estimated as a function of the measurable encoder variables. The effectiveness of the model is validated by performing experiments with the robot prototype."
icra,None,Vertical dry adhesive climbing with a 100× bodyweight payload,"Elliot W. Hawkes,David L. Christensen,Mark R. Cutkosky,","The ability to carry large payloads could greatly increase the applications of small, low cost climbing robots. We present a linear inchworm gait that uses a single powerful actuator to climb. To make this gait possible, we leveraged two new methods of achieving controllable, anisotropic adhesion (one method produces over 200 times stronger adhesion in the preferred direction). With controllable, anisotropic adhesion, the gait is robust to missed steps. In addition, the gait provides a stance in which the robot can rest without requiring power. An autonomous 9 gram robot is able to climb a smooth vertical surface at 3 mm/s, while hoisting more than a kilogram. We also present a scaled down version of the robot, which is considerably smaller than any previous dry adhesive climbing mechanism. It is actuated by externally powered Shape Memory Alloy, weighs 20 mg, and is capable of hoisting 500 mg. These climbers show that a large hoisting ability while climbing can be achieved using dry adhesives, and the presented concepts could aid in the development of autonomous, highly functional, small robots."
icra,None,On the role duality and switching in human-robot cooperation: An adaptive approach,"Bryan Whitsell,Panagiotis Artemiadis,","As the expansion of the field of robotics has continued, the physical interaction between robots and humans has become an increasingly important area of study. Many of these physical interactions can be seen as a cooperative task conducted by both the robot and the human. Often, when two humans are interacting, one of them will act as the leader of some aspect of the task and the other will act as a follower. This cooperation may require the switching of roles between leader and follower. This can be further complicated by the fact that different participants may be the leaders of different aspects of the task. Previous research in human-robot cooperation focused on the switching of only a single role. In this paper, we investigate a novel method for the simultaneous switching of two roles between a robot and a human participant. This switching method was examined using both fixed and adaptive parameters that control role switching. Overall, human-robot cooperation was successful in the task 85% of the time when using a non-adaptive method and 95% when using an adaptive control method."
icra,None,A position generation algorithm utilizing a biomechanical model for robot-human object handover,"Halit Bener Suay,Emrah Akin Sisbot,","We present a novel approach for generating candidate handover positions for human receivers. The object handover problem involves several variables and is under-constrained. The sheer number of possibilities makes it nontrivial to find a good object handover position for existing algorithms. To address this problem, we introduce the use of a custom biomechanical model in a novel algorithm for generating a handover position. The biomechanical model serves as a tool for approximating the static strength a human receiver needs to exert in order to receive an object. A mobile manipulator can use the output of our algorithm when calculating a target position for handing over an object to a human. We show preliminary results involving electromyography data and joint moment values, as well as a proof-of-concept implementation with a mobile manipulator to fetch a toolbox to a receiver."
icra,None,Collaborative human-robot manipulation of highly deformable materials,"Daniel Kruse,Richard J. Radke,John T. Wen,","Robotic manipulation of highly deformable materials is inherently challenging due to the need to maintain tension and the high dimensionality of the state of the material. Past work in this area mostly focuses on generating a detailed model for the material and its interaction with the robot, then using the model to construct a motion plan. In this paper, we take a different approach by using only sensor feedback to dictate the robot motion. We consider the collaborative manipulation of a deformable sheet between a person and a dual-armed robot (Baxter by Rethink Robotics). The robot is capable of contact sensing via joint torque sensors and is equipped with a head-mounted RGBd sensor. The robot senses contact force to maintain tension of the sheet, and in turn comply to the human motion. This is akin to handling a tablecloth with a partner but with one's eyes closed. To improve the response, we use the RGBd sensor to detect folds, and command the robot to move in an orthogonal direction to smooth them out. This is like handling cloth by looking at the cloth itself. Both controllers are able to follow human motion without excessive crimps in the sheet, but as expected, the hybrid controller combining force and vision outperforms the force controller alone in terms of tension force transient. The ability to quickly detect the state of the deformable material also enables more complex manipulation strategies in the future."
icra,None,Using tactile sensation for learning contact knowledge: Discriminate collision from physical interaction,"Saskia Golz,Christian Osendorfer,Sami Haddadin,","Detecting and interpreting contacts is a crucial aspect of physical Human-Robot Interaction. In order to discriminate between intended and unintended contact types, we derive a set of linear and non-linear features based on physical contact model insights and from observing real impact data that may even rely on proprioceptive sensation only. We implement a classification system with a standard non-linear Support Vector Machine and show empirically both in simulations and on a real robot the high accuracy in off- as well as on-line settings of the system. We argue that these successful results are based on our feature design derived from first principles."

A user study is described in which force profiles and joint trajectories were recorded for a human-human sit-to-stand experiment. These data were used to develop an impedance-based controller designed to allow the ballbot to help people out of chairs. The control strategy is experimentally verified on the ballbot, a balancing mobile robot, exhibiting lean angles of over 15° and applying more than 120 N of assistive force. To our knowledge, this is the first mobile robot to assist people in standing."
icra,None,Learning symbolic representations of actions from human demonstrations,"Seyed Reza Ahmadzadeh,Ali Paikan,Fulvio Mastrogiovanni,Lorenzo Natale,,,","In this paper, a robot learning approach is proposed which integrates Visuospatial Skill Learning, Imitation Learning, and conventional planning methods. In our approach, the sensorimotor skills (i.e., actions) are learned through a learning from demonstration strategy. The sequence of performed actions is learned through demonstrations using Visuospatial Skill Learning. A standard action-level planner is used to represent a symbolic description of the skill, which allows the system to represent the skill in a discrete, symbolic form. The Visuospatial Skill Learning module identifies the underlying constraints of the task and extracts symbolic predicates (i.e., action preconditions and effects), thereby updating the planner representation while the skills are being learned. Therefore the planner maintains a generalized representation of each skill as a reusable action, which can be planned and performed independently during the learning phase. Preliminary experimental results on the iCub robot are presented."
icra,None,Optimal gain schedules for visuomotor skill training using error-augmented feedback,"Pritesh N. Parmar,James L. Patton,","Motor Learning is heavily governed by sensory feedback, and artificially enhancing feedback influences learning as seen in our previous works. This study provides a model-based approach in determining the optimal gain schedules for augmented feedback on a visuomotor learning task. Using Gaussian process regression, we modeled the phenomenological process of learning to operate a robot with visual rotation. We then used Pontryagin's minimum principle to achieve the optimal feedback gain schedules that yield the fastest learning, the highest post-training performance, and both at the same time. Our results reveal that the instantaneous error feedback should be doubled (×1.92) throughout the training if the fastest learning is desired. However if the highest post-training performance is desired along with the fastest learning, the feedback gain should be gradually varied from 1.92 to 1. This study explores a novel approach to optimize specific aspects of training for areas such as robotic-neuro-rehabilitation, teleoperation, sports coaching, and human-machine interactions."
icra,None,Physics-based hand interaction with virtual objects,"Jun-Sik Kim,Jung-Min Park,","We propose an intuitive user interaction system with virtual objects by directly using user's hands through a physics simulation. This system aims to provide a more direct way to manipulate and interact with virtual objects and to induce more realistic reactions of the virtual objects in the interaction than the existing methods. The key contribution of this paper is to model the deformations of the user's hands in two ways: global deformation by the hand poses and the local deformation by contacts with objects. By the two deformation models, objects can be manipulated with better stability and robustness without any predefinition of interaction methods depending on the object shapes, by solely using a physics simulation. The experiment shows that the proposed method enables a user to intuitively manipulate virtual object accurately."
icra,None,Controllability of complex siphons for deadlock prevention in Systems of Simple Sequential Processes with Resources,"ShouGuang Wang,Dan You,MengChu Zhou,","Deadlock prevention policies for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) usually suffer from redundant monitors since some monitors may be added to the siphons that are originally controlled. To eliminate these redundant monitors, the controllability condition of siphons is studied in this work. For a class of Petri nets called Systems of Simple Sequential Processes with Resources (S3PR), new concepts of simple and complex strict minimal siphons (SMS) are introduced. More importantly, a necessary and sufficient condition of controllability of complex SMS is proposed for the first time. Based on this condition, an algorithm is given to control all SMS via M-controlling part of them and a structurally simple optimal liveness-enforcing supervisor can thus be synthesized for some classes of S3PR. Two examples are provided to illustrate the application of the proposed algorithm and show its superiority to prior work."
icra,None,Supervisor design and simplification for Automated Manufacturing Systems using colored Petri nets,"HeSuan Hu,Yan Yang,Yang Liu,Chen Chen,","Colored Petri nets are widely used to model Automated Manufacturing Systems thanks to their compactness to describe complex networked systems. Compared to general Petri nets, they allow many folding techniques so as to condense the system model. With them, many control synthesis problems are reduced to the solution of matrix operations. Supervisory control techniques can be realized in a computationally efficient way. In this work, these matrices are further distinguished by independent and dependent ones. A method is proposed to identify these independent ones while removing those dependent ones. As a result, a supervisor can be significantly simplified. In practice, this implies the significant reduction of cost, increase of reliability, and improvement of performance. Examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method."
icra,None,Time-varying automated manufacturing systems and their event-based control: A Petri net approach,"Chen Chen,Hesuan Hu,","As an important branch of production facilities, automated manufacturing systems are a promising perspective of modern factories which become increasingly complex and flexible. From the perspective of development, time variable is a significant concern. In this paper, we propose a class of time-varying systems, Tv-S 4 R. After involving a global time information loop, it can represent realistic system whose manufacturing process varies with time variables. Event-based control is introduced for serving two important purposes. First, it exerts time-varying specifications on the system, i.e., different processes are executed at different time stages. Second, it prevents the system from reaching any first-met bad marking which will eventually result in deadlocks. We will show that the event-based control can enhance our specifications' expressivity capability compared to their state-based counterparts in terms of generalized mutual exclusion constraints. At last, supervisors are simplified according to the identification of dependence and independence of inequalities. An experimental study illustrates the application of Tv-S 4 R and the effectiveness of event-based control method."
icra,None,An approach to specification simplification in automated manufacturing systems using invariance and inequality analysis,"Chen Chen,Hesuan Hu,","Supervisory control techniques (SCTs), as one of the fundamental researches in the domain of automated manufacturing systems, implement specifications upon a plant model, leading the system to tendentiously desired behaviors. Generalized Mutual Exclusion Constraints (GMECs) are a typical kind of SCTs which correspond to a linear supervisory specification in the context of Petri nets (PNs). Given a set of admissible GMECs, supervisor simplification is needed to reduce implementation cost and mitigate fabrication complexity. In this paper, two methods are proposed and improved in the paradigm of arbitrary GMECs simplification. For the method based on P-invariant control, it develops in the semantics of PN structure analysis, exhibiting drawbacks like low computational efficiency, high failure probability, and definite failure to control weakly L 1 -dependent inequalities. On the contrary, for the method based on inequality analysis, it germinates on the ground of algebra theory, tackling both L 1 - and L 2 -dependent inequalities. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of supervisor simplification based on inequality analysis."

In this paper, we present a methodology to identify and assess construction project plan dangers before their execution. Our methodology has the following steps: 1) Plans are translated from a high-level activity graph to a discrete event simulation model; 2) Trajectories are simulated using sampling based and combinatorial motion planning algorithms; and 3) Safety scores and risk-based heatmaps are calculated based on the trajectories of moving equipment. Finally, we present an illustrative case study to demonstrate the usability of our model."
icra,None,Approximately Optimal Computing-Budget Allocation for subset ranking,"JunQi Zhang,ZeZhou Li,Cheng Wang,Di Zang,MengChu Zhou,","The best design among many can be selected through their accurate performance evaluation. When such evaluation is based on discrete event simulations, the design selection is extremely time-consuming. Ordinal optimization greatly speeds up this process. Optimal Computing-Budget Allocation (OCBA) has further accelerated it. Other kinds of OCBA have been introduced for reaching different goals, for example, to select the optimal subset of designs. However, facing the issue of subset ranking, which is a generalized form from problems selecting the best design or optimal subset, all the existing ones are insufficient. This work develops a new OCBA-based approach to address this subset ranking issue. Through mathematical deduction, its theoretical foundation is laid. Our numerical simulation results reveal that it indeed outperforms all the other existing methods in terms of probability of correct subset ranking and computational efficiency."

Its determination given an unbounded net and initial marking has remained an open problem since 1960s. Due to its extreme difficulty, a great deal of research has been focused on some subclasses of unbounded nets. For arbitrary ones, this work intends to propose a new reachability tree (NRT), which consists of only but all reachable markings from its initial marking. Furthermore, an NRT-based method to decide deadlocks of unbounded nets is presented. An example is provided to show the new results."
icra,None,Semi-autonomous simulated brain tumor ablation with RAVENII Surgical Robot using behavior tree,"Danying Hu,Yuanzheng Gong,Blake Hannaford,Eric J. Seibel,","Medical robots have been widely used to assist surgeons to carry out dexterous surgical tasks via various ways. Most of the tasks require surgeon's operation directly or indirectly. Certain level of autonomy in robotic surgery could not only free the surgeon from some tedious repetitive tasks, but also utilize the advantages of robot: high dexterity and accuracy. This paper presents a semi-autonomous neurosurgical procedure of brain tumor ablation using RAVEN Surgical Robot and stereo visual feedback. By integrating with the behavior tree framework, the whole surgical task is modeled flexibly and intelligently as nodes and leaves of a behavior tree. This paper provides three contributions mainly: (1) describing the brain tumor ablation as an ideal candidate for autonomous robotic surgery, (2) modeling and implementing the semi-autonomous surgical task using behavior tree framework, and (3) designing an experimental simulated ablation task for feasibility study and robot performance analysis."
icra,None,Development and characterization of a dynamic smart structure providing multi-axis force sensing for robotic applications,"Davinson Castaño-Cano,Mathieu Grossard,Arnaud Hubert,","When considering force-controlled robots, one key-point to sense the arm-environment interaction is the availability of cheap but sufficiently precise multi-axis force sensors. Even if resonant sensors can overcome some well-known limitations such as noise and drift issues, designing multi-axial resonant force sensor is still non-intuitive due to dynamical nature and multiple modes interaction. This paper presents the development of an integrated three-component force sensing resonant structure, which may be used to simultaneously estimate, all the three components of the force applied on it, for the first time. The sensor principle relies on one single pre-stress composite plate where actuation and measurement are achieved with piezoelectric transducers. Feedback control based on Phase-Locked Loop is used to measure resonances, then estimate the applied forces. Multiple smart design strategies, such as modal superposition, spatial modal filtering using optimal transducers placement and intelligent signal conditioning, limit the electronic treatment and reduce the controller complexity. Experimental comparisons with other calibrated force sensors have shown that the applied force can be efficiently estimated with accuracy, demonstrating the interest of our approach to design integrated and inexpensive multi-axis force sensor solution for robotic applications."
icra,None,Integrated force/tactile sensing: The enabling technology for slipping detection and avoidance,"Giuseppe De Maria,Pietro Falco,Ciro Natale,Salvatore Pirozzi,","This paper proposes an experimental study of slipping avoidance algorithms based on force/tactile perception data. The claim is that contact force measurements alone or tactile data alone are not sufficient for an effective slipping avoidance strategy in real world conditions. Integrated force/tactile sensors able to provide measurements of both the contact force vector and spatially distributed tactile maps are the key enabling technology for efficient slipping avoidance control algorithms that can actually work with real world objects under no restricting assumption on the contact geometry or with unknown physical properties of the objects. The paper proposes a new slipping avoidance control scheme, which usefully exploits an integrated force/tactile sensor mounted on the parallel gripper of a Kuka youBot. The results show how the strategy successfully allows the robot to safely manipulate real-world objects, both rigid and compliant, in various friction conditions of their surface, both stable and slippery."
icra,None,High resolution pressure sensing using sub-pixel shifts on low resolution load-sensing tiles,"Mihai Andries,François Charpillet,Olivier Simonin,","In ambient intelligence, pressure sensing can be used for detecting and recognizing objects based on their load profile. This paper presents a pressure scanning technique that improves weight-based object recognition, by adding information about the surface of the object in contact with the floor. The new high-resolution pressure scanning technique employs sub-pixel shifting to assemble a series of low-resolution scans into an aggregated high-resolution scan. The proposed scanning device is composed of 4 load-sensing tiles, on which the scanned object slides in regular movements. The result is a regular grid image of the object's contact surface, containing the weight of each section of the grid, as well as the corresponding centers of mass. A formal proof-of-concept is provided, together with experimental results obtained both on a noiseless simulated platform, and on a noisy physical platform."
icra,None,Robotic force estimation using dithering to decrease the low velocity friction uncertainties,"Andreas Stolt,Anders Robertsson,Rolf Johansson,","For using industrial robots in applications where the robot physically interacts with the environment, such as assembly, force control is usually needed. A force sensor may, however, be expensive and add mass to the system. An alternative is therefore to estimate the external force using the motor torques. This paper considers the problem of force estimation for the case when the robot is not moving, where the Coulomb friction constitutes a fundamental difficulty. A dithering feedforward torque is used to decrease the Coulomb friction uncertainty, and hence improve the force estimation accuracy when the robot is not moving. The method is validated experimentally through an implementation on an industrial robot. A lead-through scenario is also presented."
icra,None,Localizing the object contact through matching tactile features with visual map,"Shan Luo,Wenxuan Mou,Kaspar Althoefer,Hongbin Liu,","This paper presents a novel framework for integration of vision and tactile sensing by localizing tactile readings in a visual object map. Intuitively, there are some correspondences, e.g., prominent features, between visual and tactile object identification. To apply it in robotics, we propose to localize tactile readings in visual images by sharing same sets of feature descriptors through two sensing modalities. It is then treated as a probabilistic estimation problem solved in a framework of recursive Bayesian filtering. Feature-based measurement model and Gaussian based motion model are thus built. In our tests, a tactile array sensor is utilized to generate tactile images during interaction with objects and the results have proven the feasibility of our proposed framework."
icra,None,Bayesian tactile object recognition: Learning and recognising objects using a new inexpensive tactile sensor,"Tadeo Corradi,Peter Hall,Pejman Iravani,","We present a Bayesian approach to tactile object recognition that improves on state-of-the-art in using single-touch events in two ways. First by improving recognition accuracy from about 90% to about 95%, using about half the number of touches. Second by reducing the number of touches needed for training from about 200 to about 60. In addition, we use a new tactile sensor that is less than one tenth of the cost of widely available sensors. The paper describes the sensor, the likelihood function used with the Naive Bayes classifier, and experiments on a set of ten real objects. We also provide preliminary results to test our approach for its ability to generalise to previously unencountered objects."
icra,None,Underwater robot-object contact perception using machine learning on force/torque sensor feedback,"Nawid Jamali,Petar Kormushev,Arnau C. Viñas,Marc Carreras,,","Autonomous manipulation of objects requires reliable information on robot-object contact state. Underwater environments can adversely affect sensing modalities such as vision, making them unreliable. In this paper we investigate underwater robot-object contact perception between an autonomous underwater vehicle and a T-bar valve using a force/torque sensor and the robot's proprioceptive information. We present an approach in which machine learning is used to learn a classifier for different contact states, namely, a contact aligned with the central axis of the valve, an edge contact and no contact. To distinguish between different contact states, the robot performs an exploratory behavior that produces distinct patterns in the force/torque sensor. The sensor output forms a multidimensional time-series. A probabilistic clustering algorithm is used to analyze the time-series. The algorithm dissects the multidimensional time-series into clusters, producing a one-dimensional sequence of symbols. The symbols are used to train a hidden Markov model, which is subsequently used to predict novel contact conditions. We show that the learned classifier can successfully distinguish the three contact states with an accuracy of 72% ± 12 %."
icra,None,Protection of wide-range QCR load sensor using robust outer case for stable detection of biosignals,"Yuichi Murozaki,Shinya Sakuma,Fumihito Arai,","We present a super wide-measurement range load sensor with high-durability for multi-biosignal sensing in daily life. We employed quartz crystal resonator (QCR) load sensor with super wide range (from 6 × 10 -5 to 30 [N]) for sensing of biosignals ranging from mN order (e.g. heartbeat) to 100 N order (e.g. body motion). Furthermore, we implemented an outer case which makes the sensor durable against unexpected loads in practical use. The outer case increased the durability of the sensor 88 times higher than the sensor without outer case. Finally we succeeded in simultaneous sensing of heartbeat (≈ 100 [mN]) and body motion (≈ 25 [N]) with identical sensor."
icra,None,Ground or obstacles? Detecting clear paths in vehicle navigation,"Ralph Aeschimann,Paulo Vinicius Koerich Borges,","Efficient estimation of obstacles is a crucial component in autonomous vehicle navigation. Fusing stereo vision and laser scan data is a widely used approach for obstacle detection and navigation. Stereo vision can detect obstacles and the ground. Planar laser range finders can detect obstacles, but false positives occur when the scans collide with the ground. This paper proposes an algorithm for cooperative fusion of stereo vision and laser data. The algorithm checks the consensus of the two signals before filtering out the false positive laser scans from ground hits. Experimental results for tests in real driving situations in an industrial environment are presented. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for robust and safe navigation."
icra,None,Online novelty-based visual obstacle detection for field robotics,"Patrick Ross,Andrew English,David Ball,Ben Upcroft,Peter Corke,","This paper presents a novel online unsupervised vision system for obstacle detection in field environments which detects many obstacles pathological to appearance- or structure-only obstacle detection systems. Robust obstacle detection in field environments is challenging as it is infeasible to train on all possible obstacles in all conditions, and many obstacles are camouflaged in their appearance or structure. The proposed system combines novelty in structure and appearance cues to detect obstacles, can adapt over time to changes in the environment, and is suitable for long-term operation over changing lighting conditions in various environments. After an initial learning period the method exhibits very few false positives, while successfully detecting most obstacles over both daytime and nighttime datasets including challenging obstacles such as a person lying down in grass."
icra,None,Traversability analysis for mobile robots in outdoor environments: A semi-supervised learning approach based on 3D-lidar data,"Benjamin Suger,Bastian Steder,Wolfram Burgard,","The ability to safely navigate is a crucial prerequisite for truly autonomous systems. A robot has to distinguish obstacles from traversable ground. Failing on this task can cause great damage or restrict the robots movement unnecessarily. Due to the security relevance of this problem, great effort is typically spent to design models for individual robots and sensors, and the complexity of such models is correlated to the complexity of the environment and the capabilities of the robot. We present a semi supervised learning approach, where the robot learns its traversability capabilities from a human operating it. From this partially and only positive labeled training data, our approach infers a model for the traversability analysis, thereby requiring very little manual effort for the human. In practical experiments we show that our method can be used for robots that need to reliably navigate on dirt roads as well as for robots that have very restricted traversability capabilities."
icra,None,Terrain traversability prediction by imaging thermal transients,"Chris Cunningham,Issa Nesnas,William L. Whittaker,","The inability of current robotic perception techniques to adequately detect non-geometric terrain hazards is a primary cause of failure for robots operating in natural terrain on Mars, the Moon, and Earth. Classical approaches detect surface appearance but do not measure the underlying mechanical properties that determine wheel-terrain interaction. Diurnal temperature variations of a granular material, however, are strongly correlated with both its surface appearance and subsurface geophysical properties. This paper presents a technique for determining relative differences in looseness and traversability of granular terrain through analysis of thermal imagery. Terrain compaction and traversability are predicted by estimating a material's thermal inertia from observations of thermal transients. Results from a set of experiments in sandy terrain demonstrate the ability of this approach to differentiate between safe, compact and hazardous, loose terrain."
icra,None,Planning routes of continuous illumination and traversable slope using connected component analysis,"Nathan D. Otten,Heather L. Jones,David S. Wettergreen,William L. Whittaker,","This paper presents a method that applies connected component analysis to plan routes that keep robots continuously illuminated and on traversable slopes while reaching one or more goal locations. Such routes promise to extend the lifespan, range, and scientific return of solar-powered robots exploring environments with changing but predictable lighting conditions, particularly those of the Moon and Mercury. Maps of lighting and ground slope that describe these constraints in position and time are computed, and all distinct interconnected regions that have both direct sunlight and safe slope are found using connected component analysis. These three-dimensional connected components are pruned of roots that violate time constraints and branches that dead-end in discontinuous routes. Each component is the basis for a graph that includes all feasible routes from the initial time to the final time of that component. The shortest feasible route between a pair of start and goal positions within the same component is found using A* search and is characterized by its total length and average speed. Malapert Peak and Shackleton Crater, both near the Moon's South Pole, serve as examples throughout this paper due to their highly-relevant, dynamic, and predictable lighting caused by the Moon's motion relative to the Sun."

We propose a solution based on reinforcement learning in order to accommodate the robot morphology automatically to the terrain and the obstacles it traverses. In this paper, we concentrate on the crucial issue of predicting rewards from incomplete or missing data. For this purpose we exploit the Gaussian processes as a predictor combined with decision trees. We demonstrate our achievements in a series of experiments on real data."
icra,None,Fuzzy based traversability analysis for a mobile robot on rough terrain,"Yusuke Tanaka,Yonghoon Ji,Atsushi Yamashita,Hajime Asama,","We present a novel rough terrain traversability analysis method for mobile robot navigation. We focused on the scenario of mobile robot operation in a disaster environment with limited sensor data. The robot builds a map in real time and analyzes the terrain traversability of its surrounding environment. The proposed method is based on fuzzy inference so that it can handle uncertainties in the sensor data. Two values associated with the terrain traversability, roughness and slope, are calculated from an elevation map built by a laser range finder mounted on the mobile robot. These two values are inputted to the fuzzy inference, and the traversability is analyzed. Based on the traversability output from the fuzzy inference, a vector field histogram (VFH) is generated. The mobile robot course is determined according to the VFH. We demonstrated our algorithm on an artificial environment. The experimental results showed that the mobile robot was able to reach the target position safely while avoiding untraversable areas."
icra,None,HCMDP: A hierarchical solution to Constrained Markov Decision Processes,"Seyedshams Feyzabadi,Stefano Carpin,","Constrained Markov Decision Processes offer a principled way to tackle sequential decision problems with multiple objectives. Although they could be very valuable in numerous robotic applications, to date their use has been quite limited. One of the reasons is that their solution requires to solve constrained linear programs with a large number of variables and this is computationally demanding, especially when considering dynamic environments. In this paper we propose a hierarchical approach to solve large CMDPs. States are clustered into macro states and relevant parameters like transition probabilities and costs are extracted with a Monte Carlo approach. Macro states are created with the objective of grouping together states with similar costs while preserving feasibility. We illustrate the value of our findings in a path planning scenario where the robot moves through an environment characterized by different risk levels. Our approach largely outperforms the non-hierarchical method and we also show how it prevails over methods based on fixed partitioning strategies."
icra,None,A water jet thruster for an aquatic micro air vehicle,"Robert Siddall,Mirko Kovač,","Water sampling with autonomous aerial vehicles has major applications in water monitoring and chemical accident response. Currently, no robot exists that is capable of both underwater locomotion and flight. This is principally because of the major design tradeoffs for operation in both water and air. A major challenge for such an aerial-aquatic mission is the transition to flight from the water. The use of high power density jet propulsion would allow short, impulsive take-offs by Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). In this paper, we present a high power water jet propulsion system capable of launching a 70 gram vehicle to speeds of 11m/s in 0.3s, designed to allow waterborne take off for an Aquatic Micro Air Vehicle (AquaMAV). Jumps propelled by the jet are predicted to have a range of over 20m without gliding. Propulsion is driven by a miniaturised 57 bar gas release system, with many other applications in pneumatically actuated robots. We will show the development of a theoretical model to allow designs to be tailored to specific missions, and free flying operation of the jet."

The UAV is required to provide perpetual endurance at a geographic latitude of 45°N in a 4-month window centered around June 21 st . An improved conceptual design method is presented and applied to maximize the perpetual flight robustness with respect to local meteorological disturbances such as clouds or winds. Airframe, avionics hardware, state estimation and control method development for autonomous flight operations are described. Flight test results include a 12-hour flight relying solely on batteries to replicate night-flight conditions. In addition, we present flight results from Search-And-Rescue field trials where a camera and processing pod were mounted on the aircraft to create high-fidelity 3D-maps of a simulated disaster area."
icra,None,Nonlinear observer-based tracking control of link stress and elevation for a tethered aerial robot using inertial-only measurements,"Marco Tognon,Antonio Franchi,","This work deals with a comprehensive version of the tethered aerial vehicle problem including all the three possible link cases: cable, strut, and bar. We prove the dynamic feedback linearizability and differential flatness of the system with respect to the elevation of the vehicle and the stress applied to the link. Moreover we prove the observability of the system using only on-board inertial sensors (i.e., only a gyroscope plus an accelerometer). We design a globally convergent nonlinear controller based on the concurrent use of a dynamic feedback linearization control and a state estimator based on a nonlinear state/output transformation and a high gain observer scheme. The controller/observer algorithm is thus able to globally control elevation and stress (both tension and compression) along independent time-varying trajectories only resorting to inertial measurements. The stability of the controlled system is theoretically proven and its behavior is shown by means of extensive dynamical simulations."
icra,None,Estimating camera pose using Bundle Adjustment and Digital Terrain Model constraints,"Amir Geva,Gil Briskin,Ehud Rivlin,Hector Rotstein,","Bundle Adjustment is the current state of the art method for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. This problem is important for the localization of robots, and most acute for flying robots that cannot rely on ground odometry. The solution requires additional information to resolve scale, and most implementations either assume that relatively accurate pose information exists, or utilize GPS and IMU sensors. This paper presents an alternative approach that incorporates Digital Terrain Model constraints into the Bundle Adjustment algorithm, enabling the correct resolution of scale even in the absence of additional information. It is shown, in multiple test scenarios, that this algorithm provides estimations that do not diverge with time and that exceed, in accuracy, the resolution of the underlying sampled terrain."
icra,None,"Modeling, control and design optimization for a fully-actuated hexarotor aerial vehicle with tilted propellers","Sujit Rajappa,Markus Ryll,Heinrich H. Bülthoff,Antonio Franchi,","Mobility of a hexarotor UAV in its standard configuration is limited, since all the propeller force vectors are parallel and they achieve only 4-DoF actuation, similar, e.g., to quadrotors. As a consequence, the hexarotor pose cannot track an arbitrary trajectory while the center of mass is tracking a position trajectory. In this paper, we consider a different hexarotor architecture where propellers are tilted, without the need of any additional hardware. In this way, the hexarotor gains a 6-DoF actuation which allows to independently reach positions and orientations in free space and to be able to exert forces on the environment to resist any wrench for aerial manipulation tasks. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed hexarotor, we discuss the controllability and the tilt angle optimization to reduce the control effort for the specific task. An exact feedback linearization and decoupling control law is proposed based on the input-output mapping, considering the Jacobian and task acceleration, for non-linear trajectory tracking. The capabilities of our approach are shown by simulation results."

Peréz,,,,","A multilayer architecture to control multirotor UAVs equipped with a servo robot arm is proposed in this paper. The main purpose is to control the aerial platform taking into account the presence of the moving manipulator. Three layers are considered in this work. First, a novel mechanism is proposed considering a moving battery to counterweight the statics of the robotic arm. Then, in order to overcome the mechanical limitations of the previous layer, the residual of the arm static effects on the UAV is computed and compensated through the given control thrust and torques. Finally, an estimator of external forces and moments acting on the aerial vehicle is considered and the estimations are fed back to the controller to compensate neglected aerodynamic effects and the arm dynamics. The performance of the proposed architecture has been experimentally evaluated."
icra,None,Cooperative localization and mapping of MAVs using RGB-D sensors,"Giuseppe Loianno,Justin Thomas,Vijay Kumar,","The fusion of IMU and RGB-D sensors presents an interesting combination of information to achieve autonomous localization and mapping using robotic platforms such as ground robots and flying vehicles. In this paper, we present a software framework for cooperative localization and mapping while simultaneously using multiple aerial platforms. We employ a monocular visual odometry algorithm to solve the localization task, where the depth data flow associated to the RGB image is used to estimate the scale factor associated with the visual information. The current framework enables autonomous onboard control of each vehicle with cooperative localization and mapping. We present a methodology that provides both a sparse map generated by the monocular SLAM and a multiple resolution dense map generated by the associated depth. The localization algorithm and both 3D mapping algorithms work in parallel improving the system real-time reliability. We present experimental results to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach using two quadrotors platforms."
icra,None,Coordinated launching of an ornithopter with a hexapedal robot,"Cameron J. Rose,Parsa Mahmoudieh,Ronald S. Fearing,","In this work, we develop a cooperative launching system for a 13.2 gram ornithopter micro-aerial vehicle (MAV), the H 2 Bird, by carrying it on the back of a 32 gram hexapedal millirobot, the VelociRoACH. We determine the necessary initial velocity and pitch angle for take off using force data collected in a wind tunnel and use the VelociRoACH to reach these initial conditions for successful launch. In the wind tunnel predicted success region, we were able to complete a successful launch for 75 percent of the 12 trials in that region. Although carrying the H 2 Bird on top of the VelociRoACH at a stride frequency of 17 Hz increases our average power consumption by about 24.5 percent over solo running, the H 2 Bird, in turn, provides stability advantages to the VelociRoACH. We observed that the variance in pitch and roll velocity with the H 2 Bird is about 90 percent less than without. Additionally, with the H 2 Bird flapping at 5 Hz during transport, we observed an increase of 12.7 percent of the steady state velocity. Lastly, we found that the costs of transport for carrying the H 2 Bird flapping and without (6.6 and 6.8) are lower than the solo costs of transport for the VelociRoACH and for the H 2 Bird (8.1 and 10.1)."

A local environmental control technique is desired when analyzing the detailed and localized properties of single cells. In this paper, we propose a local environmental stimulation system with micro dual-pipettes to stimulate the local reagent concentration dynamically, freely and automatically. When the local environment is controlled with chemical stimuli, the chemical solution is diffused and affects other objects. The local environment stimulation system with micro dual-pipettes can solve this problem by using spout pipette and suction pipette. As a cell analysis system, system quantification is necessary, so we try to realize it using a fluorescent substance. First step, we try to measure and control the light intensity. As an application of the system, the system can construct two-dimensional cell-organization by peeling off certain area of cell-sheet. Therefore, we try to control the area of peeling off cells using the system."
icra,None,RodBot: A rolling microrobot for micromanipulation,"Roel Pieters,Hsi-Wen Tung,Samuel Charreyron,David F. Sargent,,","We introduce the modelling and control of a rolling microrobot. The microrobot is capable of manipulating micro-objects through the use of a magnetic visual control system. This system consists of a rod-shaped microrobot, a magnetic actuation system and a visual control system. Motion of the rolling microrobot on a supporting surface is induced by a rotating magnetic field. As the robot is submerged in a liquid this motion creates a rising flow in front, a sinking flow behind, and a vortex above the robot, thus enabling non-contact transportation of micro-objects. Besides this fluid-vortex approach, the microrobot is also able to manipulate micro-objects via a pushing strategy. We present the design and modelling of the 50×60×300 μm micro-agent, the visual control system, and an experimental analysis of the micromanipulation and control methods."
icra,None,μTugs: Enabling microrobots to deliver macro forces with controllable adhesives,"David L. Christensen,Elliot W. Hawkes,Srinivasan A. Suresh,Karen Ladenheim,,","The controllable adhesives used by insects to both carry large loads and move quickly despite their small scale inspires the μTug robot concept. These are small robots that can both move quickly and use controllable adhesion to apply interaction forces many times their body weight. The adhesives enable these autonomous robots to accomplish this feat on a variety of common surfaces without complex infrastructure. The benefits, requirements, and theoretical efficiency of the adhesive in this application are discussed as well as the practical choices of actuator and robot working surface material selection. A robot actuated by piezoelectric bimorphs demonstrates fast walking with a no-load rate of 50 Hz and a loaded rate of 10 Hz. A 12 g shape memory alloy (SMA) actuated robot demonstrates the ability to load more of the adhesive enabling it to tow 6.5 kg on glass (or 500 times its body weight). Continuous rotation actuators (electromagnetic in this case) are demonstrated on another 12 g robot give it nearly unlimited work cycles through gearing. This leads to advantages in towing capacity (up to 22 kg or over 1800 times its body weight), step size, and efficiency. This work shows that using such an adhesive system enables small robots to provide truly human scale interaction forces, despite their size and mass. This will enable future microrobots to not only sense the state of the human environment in which they operate, but apply large enough forces to modify it in response."
icra,None,Generating two independent rotating magnetic fields with a single magnetic dipole for the propulsion of untethered magnetic devices,"Nathan D. Nelson,Jake J. Abbott,","Untethered magnetic devices (UMDs) driven by rotating magnetic fields have been proposed for applications in minimally invasive medicine. Previous work has explored the propulsion and guidance of a single UMD using a rotating magnet dipole source, and actuation of multiple UMDs has focused on the use of uniform magnetic fields. This work seeks to extend the methods for remote actuation using a single magnet dipole source to generate two rotating magnetic fields with arbitrary independent rotation axes at any two points with a common rotation frequency. The solutions found show that there are multiple positions and rotation axes of the magnet dipole that can generate these rotating fields. The method is demonstrated with two screw-type UMDs propelled independently within an agar gel block using a single permanent-magnet actuator."

Given the high price tag, what is needed to scale multi-agent testbeds down both in price and size to make them accessible to a larger community? One answer is the GRITSBot, an inexpensive differential drive microrobot designed specifically to lower the entrance barrier to multi-agent robotics. The robot allows for a straightforward transition from current ground-based systems to the GRITSBot testbed because it closely resembles expensive platforms in capabilities and architecture. Additionally, the GRITSBot's support system allows a single user to easily operate and maintain a large collective of robots. These features include automatic sensor calibration, autonomous recharging, wireless reprogramming of the robot, as well as collective control."

Khalil,","In targeted therapy, clusters of drug carriers (nanoparticles and microparticles) could be in contact with a surface such as the lumen of blood vessels and the interior of the gastrointestinal tract. We study the motion characteristics of clusters of microparticles when they slide on a surface under the influence of weak oscillating magnetic fields (less than 11 mT). The oscillating magnetic fields exert a magnetic torque on the microparticles and allow them to oscillate, and hence overcome the static friction and slide on a surface. We characterize the frequency response of clusters of microparticles by applying oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency range of 0 Hz to 55 Hz, in the presence of a constant magnetic field gradient (0.9 T/m). Clusters of 3 to 4 and 5 to 9 microparticles achieve maximum sliding speeds of 1100 μm/s and 1150 μm/s, at oscillating magnetic fields of 30 Hz. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate closed-loop motion control of the clusters with maximum position error of 20 μm. Furthermore, we show that the magnetic field gradient required to drive a cluster of microparticles (with 3 to 4 microparticles) decreases by 75% in the presence of oscillating magnetic fields from 5 Hz to 50 Hz."

The method can realize the assembly of micro-nano structures inside a droplet size. The surface tension is used to assemble microstructures automatically. Micro-scale or nano-scale objects are ejected from an inkjet nozzle. They are gathered at the center of the droplet and assembled by the surface tension. We conducted preliminary experiments to check whether the self-assembly of microstructures can be achieved by LiD. The experimental results show that the self-assembly of microbeads is conducted inside a droplet. The nano-scale objects can be patterned on a substrate depend on their sizes. A microstructure made of photo-crosslinkable resin was prepared, and microbeads were assembled with the microstructure inside a droplet.

icra,None,Switched fuzzy-PD control of contact forces in robotic micromanipulation of Drosophila larvae,"Weize Zhang,Xianke Dong,Xinyu Liu,","Force sensing and control are of paramount importance in robotic micromanipulation. A contact force regulator capable of accurately applying mechanical stimuli to a live Drosophila larva could greatly facilitate mechanobiology research on Drosophila and may eventually lead to novel discoveries in mechanotransduction of neuron circuitry. In this paper, we present a novel contact force scheme implemented in an automated Drosophila larvae micromanipulation system, featuring a switched fuzzy-PD controller and a noise-insensitive extended high gain observer. The switched fuzzy-PD controller inherits the fast convergence from fuzzy controller and overcomes the drawbacks (overshoot and oscillation) of a conventional fuzzy controller. The observer provides precise estimation to compensate for system modeling errors despite force measurement noise, which overcomes the disadvantage of traditional high gain observer. Force control experiments show that, compared to an conventional PID controller, this new controller-observer scheme has significantly enhanced dynamic performance in terms of rising time, overshoot, and oscillation. The developed robotic system and the force control scheme will be applied to mechanical stimulation and fluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae for identifying new mechanotransduction mechanisms."
icra,None,Folding and unfolding origami tessellation by reusing folding path,"Zhonghua Xi,Jyh-Ming Lien,","Recent advances in robotics engineering have enabled the realization of self-folding machines. Rigid origami is usually used as the underlying model for the self-folding machines whose surface remains rigid during folding except at joints. A key issue in designing rigid origami is foldability that concerns about finding folding steps from a flat sheet of crease pattern to a desired folded state. Although recent computational methods allow rapid simulation of folding process of certain rigid origamis, these methods can fail even when the input crease pattern is extremely simple. In this paper, we take on the challenge of planning folding and unfolding motion of origami tessellations, which are composed of repetitive crease patterns. The number of crease lines of a tessellation is usually large, thus searching in such a high dimensional configuration space with the requirement of maintaining rigidity is nontrivial. We propose a motion planner that takes symmetry into consideration and reuses folding path found on the essential crease pattern. Both of these strategies enable us to fold large origami tessellation much more efficiently than existing methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed method successfully folds several types of rigid origami tessellations that existing methods fail to fold."
icra,None,Optimal motion planning for a tethered robot: Efficient preprocessing for fast shortest paths queries,"Oren Salzman,Dan Halperin,","We study the problem of planning the shortest path for a polygonal robot anchored to a fixed base point by a finite tether translating among polygonal obstacles in the plane. Specifically, we preprocess the workspace to efficiently answer queries of the following type: Given a source location of the robot and an initial configuration of the tether, compute the shortest path to reach a target location while avoiding obstacles and adhering to the tether's constraints. Our work is an extension of the recent work by Kim et al. [1] who considered the problem for a point robot. Their algorithm relies on a discretization of the workspace and is optimal with respect to this discretization. We first replace their grid-based approach with a visibility-graph based approach. This allows to improve the running time of their algorithm by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, testing on a scenario similar to one presented by Kim et al., the running time is improved by a factor of more than 500. Moreover, our approach, which plans optimal paths, is applicable to polygonal (translating) robots and can be used to plan a shortest path while ensuring a predefined clearance from the obstacles. We report on our experimental results on a variety of scenarios. In all cases the preprocessing time is less than one second on a standard-commodity laptop, and a typical query takes several tens of miliseconds."
icra,None,Asymptotically-optimal Motion Planning using lower bounds on cost,"Oren Salzman,Dan Halperin,","Many path-finding algorithms on graphs such as A* are sped up by using a heuristic function that gives lower bounds on the cost to reach the goal. Aiming to apply similar techniques to speed up sampling-based motion-planning algorithms, we use effective lower bounds on the cost between configurations to tightly estimate the cost-to-go. We then use these estimates in an anytime asymptotically-optimal algorithm which we call Motion Planning using Lower Bounds (MPLB). MPLB is based on the Fast Marching Trees (FMT*) algorithm [1] recently presented by Janson and Pavone. An advantage of our approach is that in many cases (especially as the number of samples grows) the weight of collision detection in the computation is almost negligible compared to the weight of nearest-neighbor queries. We prove that MPLB performs no more collision-detection calls than an anytime version of FMT*. Additionally, we demonstrate in simulations that for certain scenarios, the algorithmic tools presented here enable efficiently producing low-cost paths while spending only a small fraction of the running time on collision detection."
icra,None,A heuristic approach to finding diverse short paths,"Caleb Voss,Mark Moll,Lydia E. Kavraki,","We present an algorithm that seeks to find a set of diverse, short paths through a roadmap graph. The usefulness of a such a set is illustrated in robotic motion planning and routing applications wherein a precomputed roadmap of the environment is partially invalidated by some change, for example, relocation of obstacles or reconfiguration of the robot. Our algorithm employs the heuristic that nearby configurations are likely to be invalidated by the same change. To find diverse short paths, the algorithm finds the shortest detour avoiding a collection of balls imposed on the graph as simulated obstacles. Different collections yield different short paths. Paths may then be checked for validity as a cheap alternative to checking or reconstructing the entire roadmap. We describe a formal definition of path set diversity and several measures on which to evaluate our algorithm. We compare the speed and quality of our heuristic algorithm's results against an exact algorithm that computes the optimally shortest set of paths on the roadmap having a minimum diversity. We show that, with tolerable loss in shortness, we produce equally diverse path sets orders of magnitude more quickly."

Bekris,","Sampling-based algorithms provide efficient solutions to high-dimensional, geometrically complex motion planning problems. For these methods asymptotic results are known in terms of completeness and optimality. Previous work by the authors argued that such methods also provide probabilistic near-optimality after finite computation time using indications from Monte Carlo experiments. This work formalizes these guarantees and provides a bound on the probability of finding a near-optimal solution with PRM* after a finite number of iterations. This bound is proven for general-dimension Euclidean spaces and evaluated through simulation. These results are leveraged to create automated stopping criteria for PRM* and sparser near-optimal roadmaps, which have reduced running time and storage requirements."
icra,None,Toward asymptotically optimal motion planning for kinodynamic systems using a two-point boundary value problem solver,"Christopher Xie,Jur van den Berg,Sachin Patil,Pieter Abbeel,","We present an approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for kinodynamic systems with arbitrary nonlinear dynamics amid obstacles. Optimal sampling-based planners like RRT*, FMT*, and BIT* when applied to kinodynamic systems require solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) to perform exact connections between nodes in the tree. Two-point BVPs are non-trivial to solve, hence the prevalence of alternative approaches that focus on specific instances of kinodynamic systems, use approximate solutions to the two-point BVP, or use random propagation of controls. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting recent advances in numerical optimal control and optimization to solve these two-point BVPs for arbitrary kinodynamic systems and how they can be integrated with existing optimal planning algorithms. We combine BIT* with a two-point BVP solver that uses sequential quadratic programming (SQP). We consider the problem of computing minimum-time trajectories. Since the duration of trajectories is not known a-priori, we include the time-step as part of the optimization to allow SQP to optimize over the duration of the trajectory while keeping the number of discrete steps fixed for every connection attempted. Our experiments indicate that using a two-point BVP solver in the inner-loop of BIT* is competitive with the state-of-the-art in sampling-based optimal planning that explicitly avoids the use of two-point BVP solvers."
icra,None,Optimal sampling-based Feedback Motion Trees among obstacles for controllable linear systems with linear constraints,"Jeong hwan Jeon,Sertac Karaman,Emilio Frazzoli,","The RRT* algorithm has efficiently extended Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) to endow it with asymptotic optimality. We propose Goal-Rooted Feedback Motion Trees (GR-FMTs) that honor state/input constraints and generate collision-free feedback policies. Given analytic solutions for optimal local steering, GR-FMTs obtain and realize safe, dynamically feasible, and asymptotically optimal trajectories toward goals. Second, for controllable linear systems with linear state/input constraints, we propose a fast method for local steering, based on polynomial basis functions and segmentation. GR-FMTs with the method obtain and realize trajectories that are collision-free, dynamically feasible under constraints, and asymptotically optimal within a set we define. The formulation includes linear or quadratic programming of small sizes, where constraints are identified by root-finding in low or medium order of polynomials and added progressively."
icra,None,Understanding the geometry of workspace obstacles in Motion Optimization,"Nathan Ratliff,Marc Toussaint,Stefan Schaal,","What is it that makes movement around obstacles hard? The answer seems clear: obstacles contort the geometry of the workspace and make it difficult to leverage what we consider easy and intuitive straight-line Cartesian geometry. But is Cartesian motion actually easy? It's certainly well-understood and has numerous applications. But beneath the details of linear algebra and pseudoinverses, lies a non-trivial Riemannian metric driving the solution. Cartesian motion is easy only because the pseudoinverse, our powerhouse tool, correctly represents how Euclidean workspace geometry pulls back into the configuration space. In light of that observation, it reasons that motion through a field of obstacles could be just as easy as long as we correctly account for how those obstacles warp the geometry of the space. This paper explores extending our geometric model of the robot beyond the notion of a Cartesian workspace space to fully model and leverage how geometry changes in the presence of obstacles. Intuitively, impenetrable obstacles form topological holes and geodesics curve around them accordingly. We formalize this intuition and develop a general motion optimization framework called Riemannian Motion Optimization (RieMO) to efficiently find motions using our geometric models. Our experiments demonstrate that, for many problems, obstacle avoidance can be much more natural when placed within the right geometric context."
icra,None,Multi-scale perception and path planning on probabilistic obstacle maps,"Florian Hauer,Abhijit Kundu,James M. Rehg,Panagiotis Tsiotras,",We present a path-planning algorithm that leverages a multi-scale representation of the environment. The algorithm works in n dimensions. The information of the environment is stored in a tree representing a recursive dyadic partitioning of the search space. The information used by the algorithm is the probability that a node of the tree corresponds to an obstacle in the search space. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and its completeness is shown.
icra,None,Sparse Depth Odometry: 3D keypoint based pose estimation from dense depth data,"Sai Manoj Prakhya,Liu Bingbing,Lin Weisi,Usman Qayyum,","This paper presents Sparse Depth Odometry (SDO) to incrementally estimate the 3D pose of a depth camera in indoor environments. SDO relies on 3D keypoints extracted on dense depth data and hence can be used to augment the RGB-D camera based visual odometry methods that fail in places where there is no proper illumination. In SDO, our main contribution is the design of the keypoint detection module, which plays a vital role as it condenses the input point cloud to a few keypoints. SDO differs from existing depth alone methods as it does not use the popular signed distance function and can run online, even without a GPU. A new keypoint detection module is proposed via keypoint selection, and is based on extensive theoretical and experimental evaluation. The proposed keypoint detection module comprises of two existing keypoint detectors, namely SURE [1] and NARF [2]. It offers reliable keypoints that describe the scene more comprehensively, compared to others. Finally, an extensive performance evaluation of SDO on benchmark datasets with the proposed keypoint detection module is presented and compared with the state-of-the-art."
icra,None,Fast embedded feet pose estimation based on a depth camera for smart walker,"Solenne Page,Maria M. Martins,Ludovic Saint-Bauzel,Cristina P. Santos,,","Assisted gait monitoring could benefit from the measurement of feet position and orientation. These measurements could also be used to implement intention-based control laws for smart walkers. Several works have been dedicated to the detection of lower limbs. The proposed methods are usually fast, but only detect the position of the legs. Others may even be more complete, but are not adapted to reactive applications. Also, they often use markers attached on the feet, which is unsuitable in daily routine. In this paper, a fast feet position and orientation detection algorithm is proposed. It is based on a camera depth sensor and does not require the use of any marker. The obtained results are compared with a ground truth provided by a motion traking system to experimentally assess the performances of the proposed algorithm."
icra,None,Active recognition and pose estimation of household objects in clutter,"Kanzhi Wu,Ravindra Ranasinghe,Gamini Dissanayake,","This paper presents an active object recognition and pose estimation system for household objects in a highly cluttered environment. A sparse feature model, augmented with the characteristics of features when observed from different viewpoints is used for recognition and pose estimation while a dense point cloud model is used for storing geometry. This strategy makes it possible to accurately predict the expected information available during the Next-Best-View planning process as both the visibility as well as the likelihood of feature matching can be considered simultaneously. Experimental evaluations of the active object recognition and pose estimation with an RGB-D sensor mounted on a Turtlebot are presented."
icra,None,Know your limits: Embedding localiser performance models in teach and repeat maps,"Winston Churchill,Chi Hay Tong,Corina Gurău,Ingmar Posner,Paul Newman,","This paper is about building maps which not only contain the traditional information useful for localising — such as point features — but also embeds a spatial model of expected localiser performance. This often overlooked second-order information provides vital context when it comes to map use and planning. Our motivation here is to improve the performance of the popular Teach and Repeat paradigm [1] which has been shown to enable truly large-scale field operation. When using the taught route for localisation, it is often assumed the robot is following exactly, or is sufficiently close to, the original path, enabling successful localisation. However, what happens if it is not possible, or not desirable to exactly follow the mapped path? How far off the beaten track can the robot travel before it gets lost? We present an approach for assessing this localisation area around a taught route, which we refer to as the localisation envelope. Using a combination of physical sampling and a Gaussian Process model, we are able to accurately predict the localisation performance at unseen points."
icra,None,An evaluation of features for classifier transfer during target handoff across aerial and ground robots,"Zsolt Kira,","This paper examines an instance of a collaborative perception problem across aerial and ground robots, specifically in the context of transferring learned appearance classifiers from one to the other. This problem is extremely challenging, as the two robots differ significantly in target resolution, pixels on target, and perspectives. We empirically explore a set of state of the art features used to distinguish the target and ask the question: What features are the most transferable between the aerial and ground robots for the purposes of target handoff, where a target must be distinguished from `confuser' objects? We show that while these features are successful on each individual robot, they are not able to be transferred naively. However, we show that using feature alignment techniques, where sparse features are mapped from one robot to the other using a shared context, we are able to successfully transfer classifiers that use color and texture features. We demonstrate these results on an extremely challenging outdoor data set simultaneously collected using an aerial vehicle and sensor-mounted ground vehicle viewing the same scene and target."
icra,None,Online unsupervised terrain classification for a compliant tensegrity robot using a mixture of echo state networks,"Jeroen Burms,Ken Caluwaerts,Joni Dambre,","Truly autonomous robots require the capacity to recognise their surroundings by interpreting their sensorimotor stream. We present an online learning algorithm for training a mixture of echo state network experts that can segment a compliant robot's sensorimotor stream. Our method follows a probabilistic approach, using a hidden Markov model to model the switching dynamics between the experts. The algorithm's performance is evaluated on an unsupervised terrain classification problem using a compliant, underactuated, six-strut tensegrity robot. The results show that our model captures the influence of terrain-robot interactions on the robot's complex dynamics and correctly segments the sensorimotor stream. We demonstrate that the activity pattern of the experts can be used to train a highly compliant robot to distinguish between different environments using only noisy internal sensors."
icra,None,Spike time based unsupervised learning of receptive fields for event-driven vision,"Himanshu Akolkar,Stefano Panzeri,Chiara Bartolozzi,","Event-driven vision sensors have the potential to support a new generation of efficient and robust robots. This requires the development of a new computational framework that exploits not only the spatial information, like in the traditional frame-based approach, but also the temporal content of the sensory data. We propose a method for unsupervised learning of filters for the processing of the visual signal from event-driven sensors. This method exploits the temporal coincidence of events generated by each object in a spatial location of the visual field. The approach is based on a modification of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity that takes into account the specific implementation on the robot and the characteristics of the used sensor. It gives rise to oriented spatial filters that are very similar to the receptive fields observed in the primary visual cortex and traditionally used in bio-inspired hierarchical structures for object recognition, as well as to novel curved spatial structures. Using mutual information measure we provide a quantitative evidence that such curved spatial filters provide more information than equivalent oriented Gabor filters and can be an important aspect for object recognition in robotic applications."
icra,None,A learning-based approach for evaluating scene recognizability of a view,"Zhou Teng,Jing Xiao,","It is important to understand which view is better recognizing and reconstructing a scene for many robotic applications, especially in a cluttered environment, where objects interact and may occlude one another in all views. In this paper, we introduce a novel, learning-based approach to evaluate scene recognizability from a view based on the quality and quantity of recognized objects, the recognition uncertainty, and the background recognizability, rather than the visibility. Our study shows that increasing visibility does not guarantee better recognizability of objects. The introduced view evaluator can better characterize which view is more useful for the purpose of autonomous object recognition and scene reconstruction. The approach is validated through experiments, and the effects of many factors to scene recognizability are discussed based on the experimental results."
icra,None,A compact spherical RGBD keyframe-based representation,"Tawsif Gokhool,Renato Martins,Patrick Rives,Noëla Despré,","This paper proposes an environmental representation approach based on hybrid metric and topological maps as a key component for mobile robot navigation. Focus is made on an ego-centric pose graph structure by the use of Keyframes to capture the local properties of the scene. With the aim of reducing data redundancy, suppress sensor noise whilst maintaining a dense compact representation of the environment, neighbouring augmented spheres are fused in a single representation. To this end, an uncertainty error model propagation is formulated for outlier rejection and data fusion, enhanced with the notion of landmark stability over time. Finally, our algorithm is tested thoroughly on a newly developed wide angle 360° field of view (FOV) spherical sensor where improvements such as trajectory drift, compactness and reduced tracking error are demonstrated."
icra,None,Fast grasp quality evaluation with partial convex hull computation,"Shuo Liu,Stefano Carpin,","We present Partial Quick Hull (PQH), an algorithm to efficiently compute one of the most commonly used grasp quality metrics. The metric relies on the computation of the convex hull of a set of points in a six dimensional space. Built on top of widely used QuickHull algorithm, PQH exploits the relationship between the convex hull and the grasp quality metric to avoid computing the whole convex hull. PQH determines at run time when the computation can be ended because the grasp quality metric can be already determined from a partially computed convex hull - hence the name of the algorithm. This improvement greatly accelerates grasp quality evaluation for force closure grasps. When the grasp is not force closure, the partial computation does not apply and PQH then behaves exactly like QuickHull. A large set of experimental tests show how PQH largely outperforms QuickHull and better scales with the size of the input."
icra,None,A taxonomy of human grasping behavior suitable for transfer to robotic hands,"Fabian Heinemann,Steffen Puhlmann,Clemens Eppner,José Élvarez-Ruiz,,,","As a first step towards transferring human grasping capabilities to robots, we analyzed the grasping behavior of human subjects. We derived a taxonomy in order to adequately represent the observed strategies. During the analysis of the recorded data, this classification scheme helped us to obtain a better understanding of human grasping behavior. We will provide support for our hypothesis that humans exploit compliant contact between the hand and the environment to compensate for uncertainty. We will also show a realization of the resulting grasping strategies on a real robot. It is our belief that the detailed analysis of human grasping behavior will ultimately lead to significant increases in robot manipulation and dexterity."
icra,None,Determining independent contacts regions to immobilize 2D articulated objects,"Noé Alvarado,Raúl Suárez,Máximo A. Roa,","This paper deals with the problem of determining independent contacts regions (ICRs) on 2D articulated objects, such that a finger contact in each region guarantees a force-closure (FC) immobilization, independently of the exact position of the finger. These regions allow a robust finger or fixture placement on the links of the articulated object, despite of possible errors in the position of the contacts. The proposal defines a generalized wrench space for articulated objects and then computes the ICRs starting from an initial FC grasp, considering frictional contacts. The approach has been implemented, and some illustrative examples are provided."
icra,None,Binding of food materials with a tension-sensitive elastic thread,"Hisashi Iwamasa,Shinichi Hirai,","Difficulties in automatic handling of many food materials are due to their softness and easy deformability by external forces. Excessive deformation of food materials damages their quality and must be avoided. Another difficulty in automatic food handling is the irregular shape and size of food materials, requiring robotic hands to adjust for differences in shapes and sizes. This study describes binding-based robotic handling of food materials, applying the concept of binding to the grasping of food materials. A tension-sensitive elastic thread was used to bind a food material, enabling the force applied to the material to be measured. Based on the concept, we developed a binding hand prototype and performed preliminary experiments to show that this binding hand could pick up a cup with food materials despite its location."
icra,None,Leveraging big data for grasp planning,"Daniel Kappler,Jeannette Bohg,Stefan Schaal,","We propose a new large-scale database containing grasps that are applied to a large set of objects from numerous categories. These grasps are generated in simulation and are annotated with different grasp stability metrics. We use a descriptive and efficient representation of the local object shape at which each grasp is applied. Given this data, we present a two-fold analysis: (i) We use crowdsourcing to analyze the correlation of the metrics with grasp success as predicted by humans. The results show that the metric based on physics simulation is a more consistent predictor for grasp success than the standard υ-metric. The results also support the hypothesis that human labels are not required for good ground truth grasp data. Instead the physics-metric can be used to generate datasets in simulation that may then be used to bootstrap learning in the real world. (ii) We apply a deep learning method and show that it can better leverage the large-scale database for prediction of grasp success compared to logistic regression. Furthermore, the results suggest that labels based on the physics-metric are less noisy than those from the υ-metric and therefore lead to a better classification performance."
icra,None,An uncertainty-aware precision grasping process for objects with unknown dimensions,"Dong Chen,Georg von Wichert,","Reliable precision grasping is a pre-condition for manipulation tasks e.g. in assembly and packaging tasks. Especially for small and light objects robust grasping is extremely challenging since even slight errors in the object pose or dimensions lead to irreparable failures caused by unintended finger-object contacts. State of the art techniques address the problem of grasping in the presence of uncertainty only at the grasp planning stage. We regard grasping as a dynamic process that needs closed loop control to be robustly executed, and propose an approach to robustly perform precision grasps despite of the significant perceptual and actuation uncertainties we have to face in reality. We conduct extensive real world experiments with light and fragile objects of unknown dimensions. The result confirms that our uncertainty-aware closed-loop approach significantly improves the robustness."
icra,None,Robust three-finger three-parameter caging of convex polygons,"Thomas F. Allen,Elon Rimon,Joel W. Burdick,","This paper studies cages of convex polygonal objects using three point fingers. The fingers are said to cage the object when it is impossible to move the object arbitrarily far from its initial placement without penetrating the fingers. We consider a three-parameter model of the relative position of the fingers, which gives complete generality for three point fingers in the plane. We consider robustness of caging grasps - what variations in the relative position of the fingers is allowed without breaking the cage. Using a simple decomposition of free space around the polygon, we present an algorithm which gives all caging placements of the fingers and a characterization of the robustness of these cages, albeit at the cost of significant computational complexity."
icra,None,Improving regrasp algorithms to analyze the utility of work surfaces in a workcell,"Weiwei Wan,Matthew T. Mason,Rui Fukui,Yasuo Kuniyoshi,","The goal of this paper is to develop a regrasp planning algorithm general enough to perform statistical analysis with thousands of experiments and arbitrary mesh models. We focus on pick-and-place regrasp which reorients an object from one placement to another by using a sequence of pick-ups and place-downs. We improve the pick-and-place regrasp approach developed in 1990s and analyze its performance in robotic assembly with different work surfaces in the workcell. Our algorithm will automatically compute the stable placements of an object, find several force-closure grasps, generate a graph of regrasp actions, and search for regrasp sequences. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm with various mesh models and use the algorithm to evaluate the completeness, the cost and the length of regrasp sequences with different mesh models and different assembly tasks in the presence of different work surfaces. Our results show that spare work surfaces are beneficial to assembly. Tilted work surfaces are only sometimes beneficial, depending on the objects."
icra,None,Experimental investigation of effect of fingertip stiffness on resistible force in grasping,"Yoshinori Fujihira,Kensuke Harada,Tokuo Tsuji,Tetsuyou Watanabe,","In this study, we experimentally investigated the effect of robot fingertip stiffness on the maximum resistible force. The maximum resistible force is defined as the maximum tangential force at which the fingertip can maintain contact when applying and increasing tangential/shearing force. We include in the definition of this term the effect of fingertip deformation. In contrast to our previous study [11], cylindrical fingertips with flat surfaces were used in this study so that the contact area would remain the same when there was no tangential/shearing force. This made it possible to see the effect of fingertip stiffness more clearly. We also investigated the effect of curvature of the contact surface, which was not investigated in depth in [11]. The main findings are as follows. 1) Harder fingertips produce larger resistible forces, irrespective of the shape of the contact surface (flat or curved). 2) For harder fingertips, the maximum resistible force depends largely on the shape of the contact surface, while for softer fingertips, the shape has little effect. 3) For softer fingertips, the magnitude of the resistible force changes little even when the normal force increases."
icra,None,A novel underactuated robotic finger for withstanding impacts of non-cooperative object capture,"Qingchuan Wang,Guangjun Liu,Qiquan Quan,Zongquan Deng,","An underactuated robotic finger is proposed and studied for capturing non-cooperative objects, featuring an underactuated rigid-mechanism that can brake residual motion of non-cooperative targets. The finger consists of three joints driven by two actuators, and a set of one-input-two-output planetary gears is introduced to realize force transmission by using the ring gear and the planetary carrier to drive the two joints. The rotation of the ring gear and the planetary carrier are governed jointly by the inputs and the external force. In the process of capturing a moving target, the proposed robotic finger can effectively limit the impact force peak due to collision with the target. Moreover, the recovery time of the joint can be adjusted by changing the input torque of the motor, which can be set to achieve optimal recovery process for different tasks. A prototype has been built to study the proposed design of the robotic finger, and experimental results have confirmed its desirable characteristics."
icra,None,Adaptive neural network Dynamic Surface Control: An evaluation on the musculoskeletal robot Anthrob,"Michael Jäntsch,Steffen Wittmeier,Konstantinos Dalamagkidis,Guido Herrmann,,","The soft robotics approach is widely considered to enable robots in the near future to leave their cages and move freely in our modern homes and manufacturing sites. Musculoskeletal robots are such soft robots which feature passively compliant actuation, while leveraging the advantages of tendon-driven systems. Even though these robots have been intensively researched within the last decade, high-performance feedback control laws have only very recently been developed. In [1], a controller was developed utilizing Dynamic Surface Control (DSC), an extension to backstepping, with an adaptive neural network compensator for joint as well as muscle friction. We compare these novel control strategies to Computed Force Control (CFC), an existing technique from the field of tendon-driven control, yielding highly improved trajectory tracking. The musculoskeletal robot Anthrob [2] serves as a benchmark."
icra,None,Non-linear robust control for inverted-pendulum 2D walking,"Matthew Kelly,Andy Ruina,","We present an approach to high-level control for bipedal walking exemplified with a 2D point-mass inextensible-legs inverted-pendulum model. Balance control authority here is only from step position and trailing-leg push-off, both of which are bounded to reflect actuator limits. The controller is defined implicitly as the solution of an optimization problem. The optimization robustly avoids falling for given bounded disturbances and errors and, given that, minimizes the number of steps to reach a given target speed. The optimization can be computed in advance and stored for interpolated real-time use online. The general form of the resulting optimized controller suggests a few simple principles for regulating walking speed: 1) The robot should take bigger steps when speeding up and should also take bigger steps when slowing down 2) push-off is useful for regulating small changes in speed, but it is fully saturated or inactive for larger changes in speed. While the numerically optimized model is simple, the approach should be applicable to, and we plan to use it for, control of bipedal robots in 3D with many degrees of freedom."
icra,None,Adaptive impedance control for upper limb assist exoskeleton,"Abdul Manan Khan,Deok-won Yun,Mian Ashfaq Ali,Jungsoo Han,,,","Need to develop human body's posture supervised robots, gave the push to researchers to think over dexterous design of exoskeleton robots. It requires to develop quantitative techniques to assess motor function and generate the command for the robots to act accordingly with complex human structure. In this paper, we present a new technique for the upper limb power exoskeleton robot in which load is gripped by the human subject and not by the robot while the robot assists. Main challenge is to find non-biological signal based human desired motion intention to assist as needed. For this purpose, we used newly developed Muscle Circumference Sensor (MCS) instead of electromyogram (EMG) sensors. MCS together with the force sensors is used to estimate the human interactive force from which desired human motion is extracted using adaptive Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). Developed Upper limb power exoskeleton has seven degrees of freedom (DOF) in which five DOF are passive while two are active. Active joints include shoulder and elbow in Sagittal plane while abduction and adduction motion in shoulder joint is provided by the passive joints. To ensure high quality performance model reference based adaptive impedance controller is employed. Exoskeleton performance is evaluated experimentally by a neurologically intact subject which validates the effectiveness."
icra,None,Tip-over prevention: Adaptive control development and experimentation,"Leah Kelley,Kurt Talke,Patrick Longhini,Garret Catron,","Skid-steered, tracked, tele-operated robots are used to perform high-risk critical missions such as bomb disposal under conditions deemed too risky to send a human. Often the robots carry heavy payloads that raise their centers of mass, increasing the risk of tip-over. Since it is often not feasible to send a human to right a toppled robot, tip-over is equivalent to mission failure. Hence, an autonomous behavior to prevent robot tip-over is desired. In this research, a simplified model of mobile robot dynamics permits separation of pitch and roll stabilization. Adaptive control is used to stabilize the appropriate angle based on the normalized tip-over measure. Experimental validation of this control is successfully demonstrated on an iRobot Packbot and a Segway RMP 440."
icra,None,Domain decomposition approach for FEM quasistatic modeling and control of Continuum Robots with rigid vertebras,"Julien Bosman,Thor Morales Bieze,Othman Lakhal,Mario Sanz,,,","This paper presents a development of a new method dedicated to the modeling and control of Continuum Robots, based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) using quasi-static assumption. The modeling relies on a discretization of the continuum robots using 6 DoFs Frames along the structure of the robot that is compatible with the modeling of a sequence of rigid vertebras. When the robot's structure relies on rods with constant sections, internal forces are computed with beam elements, placed between two adjacent frames, that applies forces and torques. In the opposite, when the robot is composed of a complex shape deformable backbone separated by the rigid vertebras, a domain decomposition strategy is used to obtain an equivalent stiffness between two vertebras using volumetric FEM. In both cases, for solving the whole robot model and inverting it in real-time, the numerical method takes advantage of the serial nature of continuum robots, using a Block-Tri-Diagonal solver. The factor of improvement in the computation time reaches several order of magnitude compared to a classical FEM model, while keeping a good precision. The method has also been implemented and tested on a real pneumatic CBHA trunk designed by Festo Robotics and some complementarity examples have been generated numerically."
icra,None,"Point-to-point motion control of a unicycle robot: Design, implementation, and validation","Yusie Rizal,Chun-Ting Ke,Ming-Tzu Ho,","This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of balance control and point-to-point motion control of a single-wheeled (unicycle) robot. The robot consists of a wheel, a body, a reaction wheel, and a turntable. The wheel is used to move the robot forward and backward to obtain longitudinal stability. The reaction wheel is used for obtaining lateral stability. The turntable provides steering torque about the vertical axis of the robot. The dynamic model of the system is derived using Euler-Lagrange formulation. By retaining the predominant nonlinear terms and neglecting the high-order coupling terms, the system model is simplified to three decoupled systems. Sliding mode control is then used to design the balance and steering controllers for the simplified model. By combining the obtained balance control and steering control, a point-to-point motion control strategy is proposed. The experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the designed control schemes."
icra,None,Smooth stabilisation of nonholonomic robots subject to disturbances,"Alejandro Donaire,Jose Guadalupe Romero,Tristan Perez,Romeo Ortega,","In this paper, we address the problem of stabilisation of robots subject to nonholonommic constraints and external disturbances using port-Hamiltonian theory and smooth time-invariant control laws. This should be contrasted with the commonly used switched or time-varying laws. We propose a control design that provides asymptotic stability of an manifold (also called relative equilibria)-due to the Brockett condition this is the only type of stabilisation possible using smooth time-invariant control laws. The equilibrium manifold can be shaped to certain extent to satisfy specific control objectives. The proposed control law also incorporates integral action, and thus the closed-loop system is robust to unknown constant disturbances. A key step in the proposed design is a change of coordinates not only in the momentum, but also in the position vector, which differs from coordinate transformations previously proposed in the literature for the control of nonholonomic systems. The theoretical properties of the control law are verified via numerical simulation based on a robotic ground vehicle model with differential traction wheels and non co-axial centre of mass and point of contact."
icra,None,Balance control strategy for legged robots with compliant contacts,"Morteza Azad,Michael N Mistry,",This paper proposes a momentum-based balancing controller for robots which have non-rigid contacts with their environments. This controller regulates both linear momentum and angular momentum about the center of mass of the robot by controlling the contact forces. Compliant contact models are used to determine the contact forces at the contact points. Simulation results show the performance of the controller on a four-link planar robot standing on various compliant surfaces while unknown external forces in different directions are acting on the center of mass of the robot.

While a number of candidates exist, the field is fragmented. It is difficult to select the best tool for a given project, or to predict how much effort will be needed and what the ultimate simulation performance will be. Here we introduce new quantitative measures of simulation performance, focusing on the numerical challenges that are typical for robotics as opposed to multi-body dynamics and gaming. We then present extensive simulation results, obtained within a new software framework for instantiating the same model in multiple engines and running side-by-side comparisons. Overall we find that each engine performs best on the type of system it was designed and optimized for: MuJoCo wins the robotics-related tests, while the gaming engines win the gaming-related tests without a clear leader among them. The simulations are illustrated in the accompanying movie."
icra,None,GPU-based proximity query processing on unstructured triangular mesh model,"Kit-Hang Lee,Ziyan Guo,Gary C.T. Chow,Yue Chen,Wayne Luk,,","This paper presents a novel proximity query (PQ) approach capable to detect the collision and calculate the minimal Euclidean distance between two non-convex objects in 3D, namely the robot and the environment. Such approaches are often considered as computationally demanding problems, but are of importance to many applications such as online simulation of haptic feedback and robot collision-free trajectory. Our approach enables to preserve the representation of unstructured environment in the form of triangular meshes. The proposed PQ algorithm is computationally parallel so that it can be effectively implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs). A GPU-based computation scheme is also developed and customized, which shows >200 times faster than an optimized CPU with single core. Comprehensive validation is also conducted on two simulated scenarios in order to demonstrate the practical values of its potential application in image-guided surgical robotics and humanoid robotic control."
icra,None,Intuitive visual teleoperation for UGVs using free-look augmented reality displays,"Kai Krückel,Florian Nolden,Alexander Ferrein,Ingrid Scholl,","For numerous real-world applications teleoperated unmanned guided vehicles (UGVs) can quite successfully assist a human in fulfilling her mission objectives. It is important for the specialists to get an overview of the site quickly and with as intuitive means as possible. Our approach to an intuitive human-machine interface for visually teleoperating UGVs makes use of a spherical camera in combination with the Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Display (HMD) Oculus Rift. The Oculus Rift is equipped with an inertial measurement unit to track the teleoperator's head orientation. With this orientation information, the current field of view is synthesized from the panoramic image coming from the spherical camera allowing a free look for the operator. In this paper, we present the hardware setup and the software system of our free-look HMD approach on our UGV. Our approach allows for multi-view, i.e, several operators can collaborate on a given task. What is more, we augment the spherical image with heading and orientation information of the robot as well as of other viewers. Our preliminary evaluation with a number of untrained user suggests that our free-look HMD offers an intuitive multi-view human-machine interface for teleoperating UGVs."
icra,None,Registration of planar virtual fixtures by using augmented reality with dynamic textures,"Simon Leonard,",This paper presents a method to align a virtual plane with a real plane in an augmented reality environment. The method addresses the challenge of configuring a planar virtual fixture during the teleoperation of a robot in a visually challenging environment. The method assists the operator to manually align the virtual plane with the real plane by providing visual cues by dynamically texturing the virtual plane. Following the manual initialization a robust evaluation of the optical flow is used to refine the alignment of the virtual plane. The system combines a stereo camera with a stereo display and generates visual distortions in the displayed images to indicate a misalignment of the virtual plane with the real one. The distortion is computed by displaying warped images from the left camera in the right display and vice versa. Results demonstrate that the method improves the accuracy of the alignment with a real plane that is covered with reflective multi-layer insulation.

Whitcomb,","The ability to refuel satellites on-orbit using teleoperated robots could extend the life of satellite missions, potentially saving time and resources for both industry and space agencies. One critical step in the refueling process is to gain access to the satellite's fueling port by cutting through a seam of tape that adheres two sections of multi-layer insulation (MLI) covering the satellite body. The deformable, delicate, specular nature of the metalized tape used to adhere sections of MLI to one another makes cutting the tape seams a difficult task to perform remotely, a difficulty that is compounded by unavoidable multi-second communications delays. Virtual-fixture-assisted teleoperation can help mitigate some of these issues by constraining the motion of the cutting blade based on a priori knowledge of the task. Adding force control may further assist teleoperators by automatically setting a desired normal cutting force. This paper presents the results of a 20-participant user study for a representative satellite tape-cutting task, showing that force control based on a virtual fixture mapped to the MLI blanket plane can decrease both tape bunching and operator workload."
icra,None,On the feasibility of heart motion compensation on the daVinci® surgical robot for coronary artery bypass surgery: Implementation and user studies,"Angelica Ruszkowski,Omid Mohareri,Sam Lichtenstein,Richard Cook,,","This paper describes the implementation of a heart motion compensation system on the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc.) for coronary artery bypass surgery. By introducing a robot-assisted solution, this surgery could be performed completely minimally invasively and on a beating heart. In this work we describe the development of open loop controllers based on spectral line decomposition and the assumption of a periodic trajectory. This allows the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track an actual heart trajectory with sub-millimetre error. Further, to simulate a virtually stabilized environment, we present the novel concept of maintaining the camera fixed relative to the heart target, effectively decoupling the vision tracking and arm tracking challenges. Finally, we executed preliminary experiments to evaluate surgeons' ability to perform simulated suturing and peg transfer tasks on a moving target. Performance for the simulated suturing was evaluated based on task completion time, accuracy of needle placement, and number of errors. For the suture task, the number of missed targets decreased from 37% to 13% when compensation was enabled, the number of hit targets increased from 26% to 41%, and completion time decreased. For the peg transfer tasks, again completion time and number of errors were measured. Though the margin for error was larger, there was less perceived difficulty of the task when compensation was enabled."
icra,None,Equating user performance among communication latency distributions and simulation fidelities for a teleoperated mobile robot,"Justin Storms,Dawn Tilbury,","This paper explores the impact of communication latency (time delay) on path following for a teleoperated mobile robot. In [1] Vozar developed a human steering model capturing the effects of latency on teleoperated driving performance and introduced the idea of equating path following performances under variable latency to an equivalent constant latency. We repeat Vozar's user experiments on a higher fidelity (dynamic) simulation using different latency distributions. Two key findings are presented. First, user tests support a relationship between path following scores for latency distributions of different shapes. Second, our user tests with the dynamic simulation produced the same trend describing latency's impact on performance as Vozar's results with a kinematic simulation."
icra,None,On-line reconstruction based predictive display in unknown environment,"Huan Hu,Camilo Perez Quintero,Hanxu Sun,Martin Jagersand,","In tele-robotics, time delay is a significant problem. When video feedback is delayed, operators adopt inefficient move-wait strategies, so system performance decreases. Predictive display (PD) is an effective solution to compensate for delays by graphics rendering of predicted visual feedback. Using advanced computer vision technology, we implemented a PD system based-on online real-time 3D reconstruction from monocular video. This paper describes the client-server system architecture. Experimental results indicate it can capture 3D models and render the predicted image in realistic applications covering outdoor rover operation on earth, Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) Mars analogue environment, UAV operation."
icra,None,A novel volumetric display using fog emitter matrix,"Miu-Ling Lam,Bin Chen,Yaozhung Huang,","This paper presents a novel volumetric display based on projection on a non-planer and reconfigurable fog screen. Unlike conventional fog projection systems which produce 2D images on flat screens, our display scatters different parts of the projected image at different depth levels, thus allowing volumetric data to be displayed in the real 3D space. We constructed the fog screen with a 2D array of nozzles that are individually switchable, while the switching pattern is tightly synchronized with the video content. Our system is superior to many existing approaches at many levels. First, our display does not require head tracking, glasses or head-mounted devices while allowing high resolution, full color 3D image to be observed from wide viewing angles by many people at the same time. As compare with various existing approaches, our system is relatively easy to setup and low cost. Most importantly, our immaterial, mid-air display allows users to directly touch and manipulate virtual objects in 3D under marker-free and barrier-free settings which opens up immense tangible and creative interaction possibilities. In this paper, we provide the details of display mechanism and design prototype, as well as a constrained optimization problem to find the projection distance that can maximize the display resolution. A number of real display examples will demonstrate the performance of the proposed system."
icra,None,VIBI: Assistive vision-based interface for robot manipulation,"Camilo Perez Quintero,Oscar Ramirez,Martin Jägersand,","Upper-body disabled people can benefit from the use of robot-arms to perform every day tasks. However, the adoption of this kind of technology has been limited by the complexity of robot manipulation tasks and the difficulty in controlling a multiple-DOF arm using a joystick or a similar device. Motivated by this need, we present an assistive vision-based interface for robot manipulation. Our proposal is to replace the direct joystick motor control interface present in a commercial wheelchair mounted assistive robotic manipulator with a human-robot interface based on visual selection. The scene in front of the robot is shown on a screen, and the user can then select an object with our novel grasping interface. We develop computer vision and motion control methods that drive the robot to that object. Our aim is not to replace user control, but instead augment user capabilities through our system with different levels of semi-autonomy, while leaving the user with a sense that he/she is in control of the task. Two disabled pilot users, were involved at different stages of our research. The first pilot user during the interface design along with rehab experts. The second performed user studies along with an 8 subject control group to evaluate our interface. Our system reduces robot instruction from a 6-DOF task in continuous space to either a 2-DOF pointing task or a discrete selection task among objects detected by computer vision."
icra,None,Development of an active haptic cane for gait rehabilitation,"Sang-Hun Pyo,Min-Gyun Oh,Jung-Won Yoon,","This research aims to develop a novel gait assistive device with enhanced gait stability and training efficiency for stroke patients. The proposed assistive device for mobility aid is composed of a motored wheel and a cane for providing only a light grip force, which prevent a patient using excessive support force of an upper limb like a conventional cane and motivate the patient to use more actively a paralyzed limb due to the reduced weight support. In addition, the proposed device can provide the user with intuitive and safe interaction during walking by integrating an F/T sensor and a tilt sensor at the cane, and a switch sensor at the hand grip. Also, admittance control has been implemented for a patient, it intuitively changes cane speed by measuring interaction forces at the hand grip. A hemi-paretic stroke patient participated in the walking experiments as a pilot study to verify effectiveness of the proposed system. The results showed that the patient could improve walking speed and muscle activation during experiments with a constant speed mode of the haptic cane. Moreover, in the admittance control mode of the haptic cane, the patient could keep higher preferred walking speed and higher gait stability regardless of magnitude of resistance forces. The proposed gait assistive device with cheap, compact and easy-to-use characteristics can provide efficient gait training modes to chronic stroke patients."
icra,None,New brooms sweep clean - an autonomous robotic cleaning assistant for professional office cleaning,"Richard Bormann,Joshua Hampp,Martin Hägele,","Millions of office workplaces are cleaned by a surprisingly small group of cleaning workers every day, however, cleaning companies struggle to recruit enough personnel these days. One solution to this challenge is to schedule available professionals for demanding tasks while relieving them from simpler activities which are transferred to a robotic cleaning assistant. Two of such tasks are floor cleaning and waste disposal which account for 70% of the daily cleaning efforts. This paper presents the world's first autonomous cleaning robot prototype that masters both of these tasks and whose development was accompanied by the advice of a large cleaning company. Besides a detailed description of the overall system and its individual components an evaluation is provided based on real world experiments. The results indicate that both cleaning tasks can be solved at high quality but with potential for increased efficiency to meet the required performance. Hence, the paper concludes with a discussion on measures necessary for the development of a commercial prototype."
icra,None,Robotic wheelchair using a high accuracy visual marker LentiBar and its application to door crossing navigation,"Bong Keun Kim,Hideyuki Tanaka,Yasushi Sumi,","In this paper, a robotic wheelchair using only a pan-tilt-zoom camera is proposed for developing a robotic system which enables a user to navigate in complex environment at low cost. For realizing the proposed system, a high accuracy visual marker, LentiBar which is capable of achieving a high level of precision in positioning and orienting a robotic wheelchair is utilized and its application to door crossing for a robotic wheelchair is presented. Since the visual marker is attached on the top of the target door through which the wheelchair is going to pass, the typical problems for achieving geometric features of the environment can be easily addressed. Door crossing navigation methods are also explained, which enable automatic and hybrid navigation of the robotic wheelchair. Finally, experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed navigation method and the robotic wheelchair system."

The robot mimics the insect's design and walking posture by driving six legs with alternating tripod gait which provides its locomotive adaptability on flat terrains. The versatile movements of the robot's leg are achieved by using soft and multiple degree-of-freedom actuators. The actuators are made by dielectric elastomers with a simple mechanism based on antagonistic configuration. By using 3D printing method, the actuator can be embedded into the frame of the robot and a control system is developed. Finally, the robot's locomotion is successfully demonstrated with variable speeds and stride lengths."
icra,None,WiFi based communication and localization of an autonomous mobile robot for refinery inspection,"Marshall Sweatt,Adewole Ayoade,Qi Han,John Steele,Khaled Al-Wahedi,,","Oil and gas refineries can be a dangerous environment for numerous reasons, including heat, toxic gasses, and unexpected catastrophic failures. In order to augment how human operators interact with this environment, a mobile robotic platform is developed. This paper focuses on the use of WiFi for communicating with and localizing the robot. More specifically, algorithms are developed and tested to minimize the total number of WiFi access points (APs) and their locations in any given environment while taking into consideration the throughput requirements and the need to ensure every location in the region can reach at least k APs. When multiple WiFi APs are close together, there is a potential for interference. A graph-coloring heuristic is used to determine AP channel allocation. In addition, WiFi fingerprinting based localization is developed. All the algorithms implemented are tested in real world scenarios with the robot developed and results are promising."
icra,None,Binaural sound source localization based on generalized parametric model and two-layer matching strategy in complex environments,"Hong Liu,Cheng Pang,Jie Zhang,","Binaural sound source localization is an important technique involving Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), video conference, speech enhancement, etc. In many real application scenarios, especially for closed environments, the affect of reverberation and noise would degrade the precision of position estimations. Therefore, a new binaural sound source localization method based on generalized parametric model and two-layer matching strategy is proposed in this paper for complex environments. Firstly, cepstral prefiltering is utilized for dereverberation of binaural signals. Then, two binaural cues computed from a dual-channel frequency representation, are combined to estimate the azimuths of sources. Additionally, the generalized parametric model is presented to describe the relationship between the azimuth and binaural cues through finding the optimal scaling factors from training data. At last, a two-layer matching strategy based on Bayesian rule is used to make the final decision, which can effectively decrease the computation complexity. Experiments have validated the proposed approach and show that it achieves favorably better results compared with several available methods without extra spacial burden."
icra,None,Unsupervised learning of multi-hypothesized pick-and-place task templates via crowdsourcing,"Russell Toris,David Kent,Sonia Chernova,","In order for robots to be useful in real world learning scenarios, non-expert human teachers must be able to interact with and teach robots in an intuitive manner. One essential robot capability is wide-area (mobile or nonstationary) pick-and-place tasks. Even in its simplest form, pick-and-place is a hard problem due to uncertainty arising from noisy input demonstrations and non-deterministic real world environments. This work introduces a novel method for goal-based learning from demonstration where we learn over a large corpus of human demonstrated ground truths of placement locations in an unsupervised manner via Gaussian Mixture Models. The goal is to provide a multi-hypothesis solution for a given task description which can later be utilized in the execution of the task itself. In addition to learning the actual arrangements of the items in question, we also autonomously extract which frames of reference are important in each demonstration. We further verify these findings in a subsequent evaluation and execution via a mobile manipulator."
icra,None,Incorporating information from trusted sources to enhance urban navigation for blind travelers,"Byung-Cheol Min,Suryansh Saxena,Aaron Steinfeld,M. Bernardine Dias,","Dynamic changes can present significant challenges for visually impaired travelers to safely and independently navigate urban environments. To address these challenges, we are developing the NavPal suite of technology tools [1]. NavPal includes a dynamic guidance tool [2] in the form of a smartphone app that can provide real-time instructions based on available map information to guide navigation in indoor environments. In this paper we enhance our past work by introducing a framework for blind travelers to add map/navigation information to the tool, and to invite trusted sources to do the same. The user input is realized through audio breadcrumb annotations that could be useful for future trips. The trusted sources mechanism provides invited trusted individuals or organizations an interface to contribute real-time information about the surrounding environment. We demonstrate the feasibility of our solution through a prototype Android smartphone-based outdoor navigation aid for blind travelers. An initial usability study with visually impaired adults informed the design and implementation of this prototype."
icra,None,Passive-dynamic leg design for agile robots,"Andy Abate,Ross L. Hatton,Jonathan Hurst,","The spring-mass locomotion paradigm is showing great promise as a template for agile and efficient robots. Efficiency and stability are enabled by the passive generation of locomotion patterns, rather than enforced by the control system. However, as leg designs develop more articulation and complexity, a problem arises: how do we implement a chosen set of passive dynamics in complex hardware? We present compliance and impact inertia analyses in a “visually tactile” way, allowing complex and redundant mechanism designs to be easily evaluated. The patterns shown here begin a framework for the comprehensive design of agile, highly dynamic robots."
icra,None,Analytical solution of target steady walking speed in 1-DOF limit cycle walking,"Xuan Xiao,Fumihiko Asano,","This paper investigates the analytical solution of target steady walking speed in 1-DOF limit cycle walking. We introduce an active combined rimless wheel (CRW) model to analyze the target steady walking state when the CRW walks on level ground. The walking speed is determined by the step period because the step length is constant. First we propose a two-period stepwise control system and the target walking period can be generated by solving the equations of boundary conditions. Second we extend this method to (n + 1)-period stepwise control system and generate a general formula for the boundary equation. At last we generate the target steady step period in the continuous control systems by calculating the approximate solution based on discretization of control input. We verify all the results through numerical simulations. If the generated walking gait is single-step-cycle, we can generate the target steady step period by our general formula in most of control systems."
icra,None,Toward step-by-step synthesis of stable gaits for underactuated compliant legged robots,"Siavash Rezazadeh,Jonathan W. Hurst,","Many control policies developed for legged robots are based on control of an underlying, simplified version of the dynamics of the robot. A good example is the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) which has become the standard control template for ZMP-based rigid robots. For compliant robots, this reduced order model is naturally the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), which has proven to have many interesting traits that are potentially useful for control of full order robots. The methods proposed so far for this purpose are mainly focused on either matching the dynamics of the robot to those of SLIP, or following a SLIP-produced trajectory. These methods can be problematic, especially for underactuated systems. In the present work, we explore an opposite approach, by starting from SLIP and step-by-step constructing toward the full order robot. The goal is to detect and capture the essential stabilizing variables in the reduced order model that can potentially maintain their stabilizing effect in the full order robot, as well. Our initial investigations show that the proposed method provides excellent potentials for synthesizing stable gaits for underactuated compliant robots by use of a much simpler and more robust approach compared to the ones previously presented in the literature."
icra,None,Running beyond the bio-inspired regime,"Duncan W. Haldane,Ronald S. Fearing,","The X2-VelociRoACH is a 54 gram experimental legged robot which was developed to test hypotheses about running with unnaturally high stride frequencies. It is capable of running at stride frequencies up to 45 Hz, and velocities up to 4.9 m/s, making it the fastest legged robot relative to size. The top speed of the robot was limited by structural failure. We present new methods and materials to make more robust folded robotic structures. High-frequency running experiments with the robot shows that the power required to cycle its running appendages increase cubically with the stride rate. Our findings show that although it is possible to further increase the maximum velocity of a legged robot with the simple strategy of increasing stride frequency, considerations must be made for the energetic demands of high stride rates."
icra,None,Anisotropic collapsible leg spines for increased millirobot traction,"Jessica S. Lee,Ronald S. Fearing,","Collapsible leg spines found on insects and spiders provide a passive mechanism for increased traction while running over complex terrain. In this paper we use this architectural advantage as biological inspiration to increase the useful work in pulling a load with a VelociRoACH, a high speed terrestrial robot. These spines exhibit anisotropic properties in the fore-aft and lateral directions, with a 2:1 holding-to-release force ratio on corkboard (0.2 N to 0.1 N). This increase in effective friction coefficient at the foot-to-surface contact points has decreased the Cost of Pulling for the VelociRoACH by ten times, allowing it to transport loads using less energy. The VelociRoACH with spines is able to engage the surface and pull up to 0.36 N whereas without spines it slips while pulling 0.2 N, demonstrating that the robot's performance with spines is now torque limited rather than friction limited. The spines also allow the robot to remain dynamically stable and resist torque disturbances."
icra,None,Kinematics for combined quasi-static force and motion control in multi-limbed robots,"Krishna Shankar,Joel W. Burdick,","This paper considers how a multi-limbed robot can carry out manipulation tasks involving simultaneous and compatible end-effector velocity and force goals, while also maintaining quasi-static stance stability. The formulation marries a local optimization process with an assumption of a compliant model of the environment. For purposes of illustration, we first develop the formulation for a single fixed based manipulator arm. Some of the basic kinematic variables we previously introduced for multi-limbed robot mechanism analysis in [1] are extended to accomodate this new formulation. Using these extensions, we provide a novel definition for static equilibrium of multi-limbed robot with actuator limits, and provide general conditions that guarantee the ability to apply arbitrary end-effector forces. Using these extended definitions, we present the local optimization problem and its solution for combined manipulation and stance. We also develop, using the theory of strong alternatives, a new definition and a computable test for quasi-static stance feasibility in the presence of manipulation forces. Simulations illustrate the concepts and method."
icra,None,Parallel composition of templates for tail-energized planar hopping,"Avik De,Daniel E. Koditschek,","We have built a 4DOF tailed monoped that hops along a boom permitting free sagittal plane motion. This underactuated platform is powered by a hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in flight and balance in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape in flight and drives energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance. The motor control signals arise from the application in parallel of four simple, completely decoupled 1DOF feedback laws that provably stabilize in isolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract reference plants. Each of these abstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents some simple but crucial specific component of the locomotion task at hand. We present a partial proof of correctness for this parallel composition of “template” reference systems along with data from the physical platform suggesting these templates are “anchored” as evidenced by the correspondence of their characteristic motions with a suitably transformed image of traces from the physical platform."
icra,None,Control and energy considerations for a hopping monopod on rough compliant terrains,"Vasileios Vasilopoulos,Iosif S. Paraskevas,Evangelos G. Papadopoulos,","Terrain compliance is a critical parameter for the performance of legged locomotion. In this work, a single actuator monopod robot hopping on rough compliant terrain is considered. Based on our controller for flat compliant terrains, this paper introduces the necessary modifications, which allow the robot to tackle the disturbance of small inclinations. Using the developed method, the robot is examined on its performance to traverse rough terrains, while maintaining the goals of reaching a desired height and forward velocity. As the increased compliance and inclination alter the energy requirements from the controller actuator, the Cost of Transport (CoT) index for a number of scenarios is studied. The correlation between terrain parameters and the CoT is presented, and useful conclusions, which can aid the understanding of the behavior of legged robots in realistic terrains are extracted."
icra,None,Insect-machine hybrid robot: Insect walking control by sequential electrical stimulation of leg muscles,"Feng Cao,Chao Zhang,Hao Yu Choo,Hirotaka Sato,","This paper reports motion control of living insect legs by electrically stimulating multiple leg muscles under pre-programmed sequential schedule. A living beetle (Coleopteran, Mecynorrhina torquata) was employed as the insect platform. Firstly, we investigated the sequence of leg motions (walking gait) of free-walking beetles to preliminarily understand which motions (leg muscles) are being activated at which timings and for how long. Each beetle leg has three degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely protraction/retraction, levation/depression, and extension/flexion. We then anatomically mapped out and located the leg muscle groups corresponding to each DoF to determine the stimulation sites (electrode implantation sites) for activating our desired leg motions. Silver thin wires were implanted into the muscles and the other ends of the wires were connected to output sites controlled by a microcontroller which allows for the pre-programmed sequential electrical stimulation. Based on the leg motion sequence in the free walking beetles, two types of walking gaits control, namely tripod and galloping were successfully demonstrated. The step frequency, which corresponds to walking speed, is user-adjustable by changing the duration of each stimulation sequence."
icra,None,Generalizing random-vector SLAM with random finite sets,"Keith Y. K. Leung,Felipe Inostroza,Martin Adams,","The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem in mobile robotics has traditionally been formulated using random vectors. Alternatively, random finite sets(RFSs) can be used in the formulation, which incorporates non-heursitic-based data association and detection statistics within an estimator that provides both spatial and cardinality estimates of landmarks. This paper mathematically shows that the two formulations are actually closely related, and that RFS SLAM can be viewed as a generalization of vector-based SLAM. Under a set of ideal detection conditions, the two methods are equivalent. This is validated by using simulations and real experimental data, by comparing principled realizations of the two formulations."
icra,None,Duality-based verification techniques for 2D SLAM,"Luca Carlone,Frank Dellaert,","While iterative optimization techniques for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) are now very efficient and widely used, none of them can guarantee global convergence to the maximum likelihood estimate. Local convergence usually implies artifacts in map reconstruction and large localization errors, hence it is very undesirable for applications in which accuracy and safety are of paramount importance. We provide a technique to verify if a given 2D SLAM solution is globally optimal. The insight is that, while computing the optimal solution is hard in general, duality theory provides tools to compute tight bounds on the optimal cost, via convex programming. These bounds can be used to evaluate the quality of a SLAM solution, hence providing a “sanity check” for state-of-the-art incremental and batch solvers. Experimental results show that our technique successfully identifies wrong estimates (i.e., local minima) in large-scale SLAM scenarios. This work, together with [1], represents a step towards the objective of having SLAM techniques with guaranteed performance, that can be used in safety-critical applications."
icra,None,Initialization techniques for 3D SLAM: A survey on rotation estimation and its use in pose graph optimization,"Luca Carlone,Roberto Tron,Kostas Daniilidis,Frank Dellaert,","Pose graph optimization is the non-convex optimization problem underlying pose-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). If robot orientations were known, pose graph optimization would be a linear least-squares problem, whose solution can be computed efficiently and reliably. Since rotations are the actual reason why SLAM is a difficult problem, in this work we survey techniques for 3D rotation estimation. Rotation estimation has a rich history in three scientific communities: robotics, computer vision, and control theory. We review relevant contributions across these communities, assess their practical use in the SLAM domain, and benchmark their performance on representative SLAM problems (Fig. 1). We show that the use of rotation estimation to bootstrap iterative pose graph solvers entails significant boost in convergence speed and robustness."
icra,None,Simultaneous localization and mapping with infinite planes,"Michael Kaess,","Simultaneous localization and mapping with infinite planes is attractive because of the reduced complexity with respect to both sparse point-based and dense volumetric methods. We show how to include infinite planes into a least-squares formulation for mapping, using a homogeneous plane parametrization with a corresponding minimal representation for the optimization. Because it is a minimal representation, it is suitable for use with Gauss-Newton, Powell's Dog Leg and incremental solvers such as iSAM. We also introduce a relative plane formulation that improves convergence. We evaluate our proposed approach on simulated data to show its advantages over alternative solutions. We also introduce a simple mapping system and present experimental results, showing real-time mapping of select indoor environments with a hand-held RGB-D sensor."
icra,None,Graph-based SLAM embedded implementation on low-cost architectures: A practical approach,"Abdelhamid Dine,Abdelhafid Elouardi,Bastien Vincke,Samir Bouaziz,","The graph-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) method uses a graph to represent and solve the SLAM problem. The SLAM allows building a map of an unknown environment and simultaneously localizing the robot on this map. This paper presents a temporal analysis of the 3D graph-based SLAM method. We also propose an efficient implementation, on an OMAP embedded architecture, which is a widely used open multimedia applications platform. We provide an optimized data structure and an efficient memory access management to solve the nonlinear least squares problem related to the algorithm. The algorithm takes advantage of the Schur complement to reduce the execution time. We will present an optimized implementation of this task. We also take advantage of the multi-core architecture to parallelize the algorithm. To evaluate our implementation, we will compare the computational performances to the well known framework g 2 o. This work aims to demonstrate how optimizing data structure and multi-threading can decrease significantly the execution time of the graph-based SLAM on a low-cost architecture dedicated to embedded applications."
icra,None,Information-based reduced landmark SLAM,"Siddharth Choudhary,Vadim Indelman,Henrik I. Christensen,Frank Dellaert,","In this paper, we present an information-based approach to select a reduced number of landmarks and poses for a robot to localize itself and simultaneously build an accurate map. We develop an information theoretic algorithm to efficiently reduce the number of landmarks and poses in a SLAM estimate without compromising the accuracy of the estimated trajectory. We also propose an incremental version of the reduction algorithm which can be used in SLAM framework resulting in information based reduced landmark SLAM. The results of reduced landmark based SLAM algorithm are shown on Victoria park dataset and a Synthetic dataset and are compared with standard graph SLAM (SAM [6]) algorithm. We demonstrate a reduction of 40-50% in the number of landmarks and around 55% in the number of poses with minimal estimation error as compared to standard SLAM algorithm."
icra,None,Self-tuning M-estimators,"G. Agamennoni,P. Furgale,R. Siegwart,","M-estimators are the de-facto standard method of robust estimation in robotics. They are easily incorporated into iterative non-linear least-squares estimation and provide seamless and effective handling of outliers in data. However, every M-estimator's robust loss function has one or more tuning parameters that control the influence of different data. The choice of M-estimator and the manual tuning of these parameters is always a source of uncertainty when applying the technique to new data or a new problem. In this paper we develop the concept of self-tuning M-estimators. We first make the connection between many common M-estimators and elliptical probability distributions. This connection shows that the choice of M-estimator is an assumption that the residuals belong to a well-defined elliptical distribution. We exploit this implication in two ways. First, we develop an algorithm for tuning the M-estimator parameters during iterative optimization. Second, we show how to choose the correct M-estimator for your data by examining the likelihood of the data given the model. We fully derive these algorithms and show their behavior on a representative example of visual simultaneous localization and mapping."
icra,None,Fast covariance recovery in incremental nonlinear least square solvers,"Viorela Ila,Lukas Polok,Marek Solony,Pavel Smrz,Pavel Zemcik,","Many estimation problems in robotics rely on efficiently solving nonlinear least squares (NLS). For example, it is well known that the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and solved using NLS, yielding a mean state vector. However, for many applications recovering only the mean vector is not enough. Data association, active decisions, next best view, are only few of the applications that require fast state covariance recovery. The problem is not simple since, in general, the covariance is obtained by inverting the system matrix and the result is dense. The main contribution of this paper is a novel algorithm for fast incremental covariance update, complemented by a highly efficient implementation of the covariance recovery. This combination yields to two orders of magnitude reduction in computation time, compared to the other state of the art solutions. The proposed algorithm is applicable to any NLS solver implementation, and does not depend on incremental strategies described in our previous papers, which are not a subject of this paper."
icra,None,3D-reconstruction of indoor environments from human activity,"Barbara Frank,Michael Ruhnke,Maxim Tatarchenko,Wolfram Burgard,","Observing human activities can reveal a lot about the structure of the environment, the objects contained therein and also their functionality. This knowledge, in turn, can be useful for robots interacting with humans or for robots performing mobile manipulation tasks. In this paper, we present an approach to infer the geometric and functional structure of the environment and the position of certain relevant objects in it from human activity. We observe this activity using a full-body motion capture system consisting of a set of inertial measurement units. This is a hard problem since our data suit provides odometry estimates only, which severely drift over time. Therefore, we regard the objects inferred from the activities as landmarks in a graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping problem, which we optimize to obtain accurate estimates about the poses of the objects and the trajectory of the human. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the reconstruction of 3D representations. The resulting models not only contain a geometric but also a functional description of the environment and naturally provide a segmentation into individual objects."
icra,None,The synchronization problem for information exchange between aerial robots under communication constraints,"J.M. Díaz-Báñez,E. Caraballo,M.A. Lopez,S. Bereg,I. Maza,A. Ollero,","This paper addresses a synchronization problem that arises when a team of aerial robots (ARs) need to communicate while performing assigned tasks in a cooperative scenario. Each robot has a limited communication range and flies within a previously assigned closed path. When two robots are close enough, a communication link may be established allowing the robots to share information. The goal is to schedule the flights such that the entire system can be synchronized for maximum information exchange, that is, every pair of neighbors are on the feasible communication link at the same time. We propose an algorithm for scheduling a team of robots in this scenario and propose a robust framework where the synchronization of a large team of robots is assured. The approach allows us to design a fault-tolerant system that can be used for multiple tasks such as surveillance, area exploration, searching for targets in a hazardous environment, and assembly and structure construction, to name a few."
icra,None,Hierarchical cooperative control framework of multiple quadrotor-manipulator systems,"Hyunsoo Yang,Dongjun Lee,","We propose an hierarchical control framework for multiple cooperative quadrotor-manipulator systems, which allows us to endow the common grasped object with a user-specified desired behavior (e.g., trajectory tracking, compliant interaction, etc.). To achieve this, our control framework consists of the following hierarchical layers: 1) object desired behavior design; 2) optimal cooperative force distribution; and 3) individual quadrotor-manipulator control based on object stiffness model, which can also take into account different dynamics characteristics of the (slower/coarse) quadrotor-platform and the (faster/fine) manipulator. Simulations of object transport and compliant interaction with three quadrotor-manipulator systems are performed to illustrate the theory."

To overcome this problem, we propose a new configuration of an aerial manipulator with perching function, knob-twisting function, and door-pushing function. Perching function can be achieved by integration of door-approach control, the mechanism for perching and attitude-change control. With regard to knob-twisting function, the design concept of a light-weight manipulator generating large enough force to twist the knob is introduced, which is composed of a soft-bag actuator with variable restriction to perform the arbitrary curved trajectory. On the other hand, the door pushing force is aimed to be generated by the lift of the propeller, which is helpful to avoid gaining the additional weight. The validity of the proposed methods is experimentally verified by using the developed prototype."
icra,None,Autonomous perching and take-off on vertical walls for a quadrotor micro air vehicle,"Arash Kalantari,Karan Mahajan,Donald Ruffatto,Matthew Spenko,","This paper details an autonomous perching and take-off method for a quadrotor micro air vehicle (MAV) using a novel dry adhesive gripper on smooth vertical walls. The gripper mechanism uses three directional dry adhesive pads in a triangular configuration. Each pad is equipped with a force sensor that can detect the pad's loading condition. A servo motor is used to actuate the attachment and detachment of the gripper, which is mounted in the front of a quadrotor MAV. This makes perching possible by simply flying toward and hitting the target surface. Autonomous control is made possible using a Microsoft Kinect to localize the MAV and a PID controller to control the perching maneuver. Experiments show that a minimum speed of 0.4m/s is required to guarantee a successful perch. Also, in 93% of the experiments in which the MAV hits the target at a speed higher than 0.4m/s, the perching maneuver is successful. To initiate a take-off procedure, a release signal is sent to the servo and the gripper is detached from the wall by pulling the adhesive away from the surface. Once the gripper is detached, the MAV becomes airborne again and the control system stabilizes the flight."
icra,None,UAV fall detection from a dynamic perch using Instantaneous Centers of Rotation and inertial sensing,"Kyle L. Crandall,Mark A. Minor,","Much research has been done recently on getting various UAVs to perch on various surfaces, however very little research has looked at how to detect when this perch has failed, especially when the surface the UAV is perched on is moving. This paper proposes a method to detect these types of falls using the Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR) of the UAV. Two methods are proposed to calculate this ICR, one based on integrating accelerometers to get velocities at various points on the UAV, the other based on using the magnitude of the acceleration at these points to estimate the distance to the ICR from that point. These methods provide a way to detect a fall from a moving perch that should work with different types of perching mechanisms and perches, while requiring minimal additional hardware on the UAV."

A behavioral control, based on the Null Space-based Behavioral (NSB) paradigm, is proposed to tackle the coordination between the arm and vehicle motions. To this aim, a set of basic functionalities (called elementary behaviors) are designed and combined in a priority order to attain complex tasks (called compound behaviors). The proposed controller has been experimentally validated on a multirotor aircraft with an attached 6 Degree of Freedoms manipulator. Two experimental case studies, involving several compound behaviors, have been reported and the results show the effectiveness of the approach."

The RUAV was supposed to track the movable platform, pick up barrels on the supplier platform, stack barrels on the replenishment platform, take off and land autonomously without any human interference. The final score was determined based on the mission completion time and the stacking accuracy. The main challenges involved in this mission include attitude stabilizing with varying payload, accurate movable platform tracking and task-scheduling. An unmanned helicopter (UH) automatic barrels transportation system was established by our team, and the navigation system, control system and task scheduling system will be detailed in this paper, along with the flight tests before and in the competition. The system's performance has been verified in the competition and won the first prize finally."
icra,None,Towards model-predictive control for aerial pick-and-place,"Gowtham Garimella,Marin Kobilarov,",This paper considers pick-and-place tasks using aerial vehicles equipped with manipulators. The main focus is on the development and experimental validation of a nonlinear model-predictive control methodology to exploit the multi-body system dynamics and achieve optimized performance. At the core of the approach lies a sequential Newton method for unconstrained optimal control and a high-frequency low-level controller tracking the generated optimal reference trajectories. A low cost quadrotor prototype with a simple manipulator extending more than twice the radius of the vehicle is designed and integrated with an on-board vision system for object tracking. Experimental results show the effectiveness of model-predictive control to motivate the future use of real-time optimal control in place of standard ad-hoc gain scheduling techniques.

The mechanical structure of the system, the number of thrusters and their geometry will be derived from technical optimization problems. The aforementioned problems are defined by taking into consideration the desired actuation forces and torques applied to the end-effector of the system. The framework of the proposed system is designed in a CAD Package in order to evaluate the system parameter values. Following this, the kinematic and dynamic models are developed and an adaptive backstepping controller is designed aiming to control the exact position and orientation of the end-effector in the Cartesian space. Finally, the performance of the system is demonstrated through a simulation study, where a manipulation task scenario is investigated."
icra,None,Toward rapid prototyping of miniature Capsule Robots,"Addisu Taddese,Marco Beccani,Ekawahyu Susilo,Péter Völgyesi,,,","Minimally invasive robotic surgery techniques are becoming popular thanks to their enhanced patient benefits, including shorter recovery time, better cosmetic results and reduced discomforts. Less invasive procedures would be achieved with the use of Medical Capsule Robots (MCRs). These devices are characterized by low power requirements and small dimensions as well as uncompromising safety. MCRs operate wirelessly in abdominal Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) and Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) or in the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The design process of MCRs, however, is expensive and time consuming. A platform for rapid prototyping MCRs is needed so that MCR researchers can reduce development costs and spend more time in studying innovative MCR applications. In this work, we introduce an open source modular platform geared toward rapid prototyping MCRs. To speed up the prototyping process, the MCR is programmed using TinyOS instead of bare-bone C. We present the hardware architecture of the platform, and the motivation for using TinyOS. To show the viability of TinyOS, we present results from an experiment involving sensing, actuation and wireless communication. This work lays the foundation for our future goal of building an integrated design environment for the design, analysis and simulation of MCRs."
icra,None,Automatic initialization and dynamic tracking of surgical suture threads,"Russell C. Jackson,Rick Yuan,Der-Lin Chow,Wyatt Newman,M. Cenk Çavuşoğlu,","In order to realize many of the potential benefits associated with robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery, the robot must be more than a remote controlled device. Currently using a surgical robot can be challenging, fatiguing, and time consuming. Teaching the robot to actively assist surgical tasks, such as suturing, has the potential to vastly improve both patient outlook and the surgeon's efficiency. One obstacle to completing surgical sutures autonomously is the difficulty in tracking surgical suture threads. This paper proposes an algorithm which uses a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curve to model a suture thread. The NURBS model is initialized from a single selected point located on the thread. The NURBS curve is optimized by minimizing the image match energy between the projected stereo NURBS image and the segmented thread image. The algorithm is able to accurately track a suture thread as it translates, deforms, and changes length in real-time."
icra,None,Tissue discrimination based on vibratory sense in robot-assisted spine surgery,"Yu Dai,Yuan Xue,Jianxun Zhang,","One of the major challenge in spine surgery is successfully cutting the desired bony structure while avoiding injury to the vital anatomy such as the spinal cord. This paper presents a vibration signal processing method to discriminate different types of tissue in robot-assisted spine surgery. During bone milling process, the tissue vibration signal measured by a laser displacement sensor is decomposed into some frequency sub-bands through the wavelet packet transform, and the harmonic component whose frequency is an integer times of the spindle frequency is obtained. The wavelet energy of the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd harmonics is then used as input vector to an artificial neural network for discriminating tissue. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive milling experiments are carried out on porcine spines. The experimental results indicate that the method produces up to 100% discrimination accuracy for the vertebra being cut and the spinal cord, and yields the success discrimination rate of more than 80% for the adjacent bony structure and the muscle, so the safety of robot-assisted spine surgery is improved."
icra,None,3D shape visualization of curved needles in tissue from 2D ultrasound images using RANSAC,"Michael Waine,Carlos Rossa,Ronald Sloboda,Nawaid Usmani,Mahdi Tavakoli,","This paper introduces an automatic method to visualize 3D needle shapes for reliable assessment of needle placement during needle insertion procedures. Based on partial observations of the needle within a small sample of 2D transverse ultrasound images, the 3D shape of the entire needle is reconstructed. An intensity thresholding technique is used to identify points representing possible needle locations within each 2D ultrasound image. Then, a Random Sample and Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is used to filter out false positives and fit the remaining points to a polynomial model. To test this method, a set of 21 transverse ultrasound images of a brachytherapy needle embedded within a transparent tissue phantom are obtained and used to reconstruct the needle shape. Results are validated using camera images which capture the true needle shape. For this experimental data, obtaining at least three images from an insertion depth of 50 mm or greater allows the entire needle shape to be calculated with an average error of 0.5 mm with respect to the measured needle curve obtained from the camera image. Future work and application to robotics is also discussed."
icra,None,Multimodal noncontact tracking of surgical instruments,"Tara A. Bracken,Michael D. Naish,","This paper describes the development and validation of the Inertial and Range-Enhanced Surgical (IRES) tracker-a novel, noncontact laparoscopic tracking system that may be used as an inexpensive alternative to optical and electromagnetic (EM) tracking systems for tracking surgical instruments. The system is based on the fusion of inertial, magnetic and distance sensing to generate real-time, 6-DOF pose data. Orientation is estimated using a Kalman-filtered attitude-heading reference system (AHRS) and restricted motion at the trocar provides a datum from which position information can be recovered. The IRES tracker was validated within a surgical training box. The results show that the IRES tracker achieves similar performance to an EM tracker with position error as low as 1.25 mm RMS and orientation error <;0.58° RMS along each axis. It also displayed greater precision and superior magnetic interference rejection capabilities. At a fraction of the cost of current laparoscopic tracking methods, the IRES tracking system is a suitable alternative for use in surgical training and skills assessment."

In certain parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach, the capsule should be self-propelled. This study examines the swimming mechanism for a miniature gastric pill endoscope. Our method is based on a constant external magnetic field, such as the B 0 field of an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), that drives a pair of coils in order to create an undulating swimming motion. We present a dynamic model of the two coil swimmer and compare it to the results obtained using PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry). We demonstrate that our swimmer is able to create an average propulsive force of 0.03 mN and 0.07 mN for the flow regimes tested, which is in a reasonable agreement with the results of the proposed dynamic model."
icra,None,A multi-sensory mechatronic device for localizing tumors in minimally invasive interventions,"Abelardo Escoto,Srikanth Bhattad,Arefin Shamsil,André Sanches,,,,,","Tumor localization in traditional lung resection surgery requires manual palpation of the deflated lung through a thoracotomy. It is a painful procedure that is not suitable for many patients. Therefore, a multisensory mechatronic device was designed to localize tumors using a minimally invasive approach. The device is sensorized with tactile, ultrasound and position sensors in order to obtain multimodal data of soft tissue in real time. This paper presents the validation of the efficiency and efficacy of this device via an ex vivo experimental study. Tumor pathology was simulated by embedding iodine-agar phantom tumors of varying shapes and sizes into porcine liver tissue. The device was then used to palpate the tissue to localize and visualize the simulated tumors. Markers were then placed on the location of the tumors and fluoroscopic imaging was performed on the tissue in order to determine the localization accuracy of the device. Our results show that the device localized 87.5% of the tumors with an average deviation from the tumor center of 3.42 mm."
icra,None,A novel marker for estimating the pose of a CT-guided robotic device using a single slice,"Florent Nageotte,Riad Khelifi,Bernard Bayle,","Automatic robot / Computed Tomography (CT) scanner registration is an important feature for robot-assisted percutaneous needle placement under CT-scanner. This registration can be done using 3D images, but for fast, low X-ray radiation it is interesting to be able to perform the registration with a single slice. In this paper, a new marker is proposed, which allows to estimate the pose of a device using a single slice. This marker, called ZCM, consists of three circles or ellipses arranged in a Z-shape configuration. It is shown that it provides a larger workspace (i.e. a larger set of visible configurations) for pose measurement than the standard Brown-Roberts-Wells, while maintaining a good accuracy. A closed-form method is proposed for solving the pose estimation with this marker. Simulations and experimental tests using a mock-up patient-mounted robot are presented and confirm the theoretical analysis."
icra,None,New motorized micromanipulator for robot-assisted laser phonomicrosurgery,"Nikhil Deshpande,Leonardo S. Mattos,Darwin G. Caldwell,","In laser-based laryngeal surgeries, motorized laser scanners offer greater aiming accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, a new motorized laser micromanipulator is presented, which is based on a spherical orienting device. It is a 2 degrees-of-freedom roll/pitch mechanism which actuates the laser beamsplitter mirror for improved aiming control and automated intraoperative planning. The combination of this device with state-of-the-art reflective laser focusing optics overcomes the drawbacks of an earlier prototype, providing increased operating distance and surgical range. This makes the device more suitable to real surgical scenarios in the operating room (OR). Improved system accuracy and usability is successfully demonstrated through comparative user trials against the traditional manual laser micromanipulator. The new device offers greater than 57% improvement in accuracy demonstrating its safety and usability. Preliminary ex-vivo trials were also performed with expert surgeons with the new mechanism. The surgeons evaluated the system positively and provided valuable and favourable feedback pointing to the suitability of the device for the OR and its potential to enhance the capacity of laser-based transoral microsurgeries."
icra,None,"Incremental, sensor-based motion generation for mobile manipulators in unknown, dynamic environments","Peter Lehner,Arne Sieverling,Oliver Brock,","We present an incremental method for motion generation in environments with unpredictably moving and initially unknown obstacles. The key to the method is its incremental nature: it locally augments and adapts global motion plans in response to changes in the environment, even if they significantly change the connectivity of the world. The restriction to local changes to a global plan results from the fact that in mobile manipulation, robots can ultimately only rely on their on-board sensors to perceive changes in the world. The proposed method addresses three sub-problems of motion generation with three algorithmic components. The first component reactively adapts plans in response to small, continuous changes. The second augments the plan locally in response to connectivity changes. And the third extracts a global, goal-directed motion from the representation maintained by the first two components. In an experimental evaluation of this method, we show a real-world mobile manipulator executing a whole-body motion task in an initially unknown environment, while incrementally maintaining a plan using only on-board sensors."
icra,None,On the value of information in a differential pursuit-evasion game,"Israel Becerra,Vladimir Macias,Rafael Murrieta-Cid,","In this paper, we address the pursuit/evasion problem of capturing an omnidirectional evader using a Differential Drive Robot (DDR) in an obstacle-free environment. The goal of the evader is to keep the pursuer farther than the capture distance for as long as possible and for the pursuer the goal is to capture the evader as soon as possible. In [1] an open-loop time-optimal strategy is proposed for this pursuit/evasion problem. In [2] a state feedback-based time-optimal motion policy for the DDR is provided. The time-optimal strategies obtained in [1] are in Nash equilibrium, meaning that any unilateral deviation of a player from the optimal strategies does not provide it a benefit in its payoff. However, Nash equilibrium does not tell if one player deviates from its optimal policy then, does there exist a new strategy for the other player that can take advantage of such deviation? If so, which is the required information to improve the payoff compared with the worst case scenario? In this paper we address those questions, analysing the scenario in which the players deviate from their optimal controls. We show that when the evader deviates from its optimal speed there are cases where there exists a new pursuer motion strategy that reduces the time to capture the evader. The shown cases where the time to capture the evader is reduced require more information about the evader's state. Nevertheless, there are also cases in which despite the availability of new information, the pursuer must stick to the worst case strategy, otherwise it cannot capture the evader."
icra,None,Decentralized active information acquisition: Theory and application to multi-robot SLAM,"Nikolay Atanasov,Jerome Le Ny,Kostas Daniilidis,George J. Pappas,","This paper addresses the problem of controlling mobile sensing systems to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gathering information autonomously. It applies to scenarios such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance and reconnaissance, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A multi-sensor active information acquisition problem, capturing the common characteristics of these scenarios, is formulated. The goal is to design sensor control policies which minimize the entropy of the estimation task, conditioned on the future measurements. First, we provide a non-greedy centralized solution, which is computationally fast, since it exploits linearized sensing models, and memory efficient, since it exploits sparsity in the environment model. Next, we decentralize the control task to obtain linear complexity in the number of sensors and provide suboptimality guarantees. Finally, our algorithms are applied to the multi-robot active SLAM problem to enable a decentralized nonmyopic solution that exploits sparsity in the planning process."
icra,None,Active exploration using trajectory optimization for robotic grasping in the presence of occlusions,"Gregory Kahn,Peter Sujan,Sachin Patil,Shaunak Bopardikar,Julian Ryde,,,","We consider the task of actively exploring unstructured environments to facilitate robotic grasping of occluded objects. Typically, the geometry and locations of these objects are not known a priori. We mount an RGB-D sensor on the robot gripper to maintain a 3D voxel map of the environment during exploration. The objective is to plan the motion of the sensor in order to search for feasible grasp handles that lie within occluded regions of the map. In contrast to prior work that generates exploration trajectories by sampling, we directly optimize the exploration trajectory to find grasp handles. Since it is challenging to optimize over the discrete voxel map, we encode the uncertainty of the positions of the occluded grasp handles as a mixture of Gaussians, one per occluded region. Our trajectory optimization approach encourages exploration by penalizing a measure of the uncertainty. We then plan a collision-free trajectory for the robot arm to the detected grasp handle. We evaluated our approach by actively exploring and attempting 300 grasps. Our experiments suggest that compared to the baseline method of sampling 10 trajectories, which successfully grasped 58% of the objects, our active exploration formulation with trajectory optimization successfully grasped 93% of the objects, was 1.3× faster, and had 3.2× fewer failed grasp attempts."
icra,None,Information-theoretic mapping using Cauchy-Schwarz Quadratic Mutual Information,"Benjamin Charrow,Sikang Liu,Vijay Kumar,Nathan Michael,","We develop a computationally efficient control policy for active perception that incorporates explicit models of sensing and mobility to build 3D maps with ground and aerial robots. Like previous work, our policy maximizes an information-theoretic objective function between the discrete occupancy belief distribution (e.g., voxel grid) and future measurements that can be made by mobile sensors. However, our work is unique in three ways. First, we show that by using Cauchy-Schwarz Quadratic Mutual Information (CSQMI), we get significant gains in efficiency. Second, while most previous methods adopt a myopic, gradient-following approach that yields poor convergence properties, our algorithm searches over a set of paths and is less susceptible to local minima. In doing so, we explicitly incorporate models of sensors, and model the dependence (and independence) of measurements over multiple time steps in a path. Third, because we consider models of sensing and mobility, our method naturally applies to both ground and aerial vehicles. The paper describes the basic models, the problem formulation and the algorithm, and demonstrates applications via simulation and experimentation."
icra,None,Scheduled perception for energy-efficient path following,"Peter Ondrúška,Corina Gurău,Letizia Marchegiani,Chi Hay Tong,,","This paper explores the idea of reducing a robot's energy consumption while following a trajectory by turning off the main localisation subsystem and switching to a lower-powered, less accurate odometry source at appropriate times. This applies to scenarios where the robot is permitted to deviate from the original trajectory, which allows for energy savings. Sensor scheduling is formulated as a probabilistic belief planning problem. Two algorithms are presented which generate feasible perception schedules: the first is based upon a simple heuristic; the second leverages dynamic programming to obtain optimal plans. Both simulations and real-world experiments on a planetary rover prototype demonstrate over 50% savings in perception-related energy, which translates into a 12% reduction in total energy consumption."
icra,None,Optimal sensing via multi-armed bandit relaxations in mixed observability domains,"Mikko Lauri,Risto Ritala,","Sequential decision making under uncertainty is studied in a mixed observability domain. The goal is to maximize the amount of information obtained on a partially observable stochastic process under constraints imposed by a fully observable internal state. An upper bound for the optimal value function is derived by relaxing constraints. We identify conditions under which the relaxed problem is a multi-armed bandit whose optimal policy is easily computable. The upper bound is applied to prune the search space in the original problem, and the effect on solution quality is assessed via simulation experiments. Empirical results show effective pruning of the search space in a target monitoring domain."
icra,None,Propositional Temporal Logic for planning in an embedded Concurrent Autonomous Agent,"Diego Stéfano,F. Ferreira,Priscila S. Martins,André Gustavo S. Conceição,,","In this paper, a Propositional Temporal Logic (PTL) inference engine is implemented in the cognitive level of a Concurrent Autonomous Agent (CAA). The hardware architecture of the system is an embedded microcontrollers network designed to fit the concurrency requirements of the cognitive model of the aforementioned agent. The architecture of the agent comprises three levels, namely, the reactive level, instinctive level and the cognitive level, which runs concurrently. The reactive level is embedded in a PSoC 5LP, consisting of behaviours created over a embedded kinematic controller. The instinctive level runs in an ARM mbed, which receives perceptions from and sends the active behaviour to the reactive level through a CAN bus. This level uses a Knowledge Based System (KBS) with First Order Logic (FOL) as automatic reasoning mechanism. The cognitive level runs an implementation of the METATEM algorithm on a DNP/2486 which, in turn, receives symbolic information from the instinctive level to update its logical world model. It also sends new local goals to instinctive level through an Ethernet network. Finally, the architecture used in the experiments is presented, followed by the results."
icra,None,Dynamic programming guided exploration for sampling-based motion planning algorithms,"Oktay Arslan,Panagiotis Tsiotras,","Several sampling-based algorithms have been recently proposed that ensure asymptotic optimality. The convergence of these algorithms can be improved if sampling is guided toward the most promising region of the search space where the solution is more likely to be found. In this paper we propose three sample rejection methods that leverage the classification of the samples according to their potential of being part of the optimal solution to guide the exploration of the motion planner to promising regions of the search space. These sampling strategies are a direct by-product of the exploitation phase of the algorithm, which uses a dynamic programming (DP) step while planning on random graphs as, for example, is done in the RRT# algorithm. It is shown that the proposed sampling strategies are able to compute high-quality solutions, much faster than existing algorithms. We provide numerical results and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the original RRT# and the RRT* algorithms."
icra,None,Camera calibration correction in Shape from Inconsistent Silhouette,"Amy Tabb,Johnny Park,","The use of shape from silhouette for reconstruction tasks is plagued by two types of real-world errors: camera calibration error and silhouette segmentation error. When either error is present, we call the problem the Shape from Inconsistent Silhouette (SfIS) problem. In this paper, we show how small camera calibration error can be corrected when using a previously-published SfIS technique to generate a reconstruction, by using an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach. We give formulations under two scenarios: the first of which is only external camera calibration parameters rotation and translation need to be corrected for each camera and the second of which is that both internal and external parameters need to be corrected. We formulate the problem as a 2D-3D ICP problem and find approximate solutions using a nonlinear minimization algorithm, the Levenberg-Marquadt method. We demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to create more representative reconstructions of both synthetic and real datasets of thin objects as compared to uncorrected datasets."
icra,None,Shadow compensation for outdoor perception,"Rishi Ramakrishnan,Juan Nieto,Steve Scheding,","Outdoor robotic systems rely on perception modules that must be robust to variations in environmental conditions. In particular, vision-based perception systems are affected by illumination variations caused by occlusions. We propose an approach to calculate the lighting distribution of outdoor scenes. The new approach enables us to compensate for shadows and therefore obtain images which are invariant to the sun position and scene geometry, while also retaining the dimensionality of the original data. The method combines images with geometric information provided by range sensors to infer shadows. We select a pair of points on a shadow boundary from a single material and estimate a terrestrial sunlight-skylight ratio. Individual scaling factors are then calculated for all points based on their orientation and incident illumination sources. The result is a coloured point cloud that is independent of illumination variation due to occlusions and geometry. To demonstrate the effectiveness and generalisation of the approach, we present evaluations using two datasets with different cameras. The first uses a hyperspectral sensor that allows us to analyse the results for a large number of wavelengths, while the second dataset uses a standard RGB camera. The approach is shown to consistently provide good illumination compensation in both scenarios."
icra,None,Motion-based calibration of multimodal sensor arrays,"Zachary Taylor,Juan Nieto,","This paper formulates a new pipeline for automated extrinsic calibration of multi-sensor mobile platforms. The new method can operate on any combination of cameras, navigation sensors and 3D lidars. Current methods for extrinsic calibration are either based on special markers and/or chequerboards, or they require a precise parameters initialisation for the calibration to converge. These two limitations prevent them from being fully automatic. The method presented in this paper removes these restrictions. By combining information extracted from both, platform's motion estimates and external observations, our approach eliminates the need for special markers and also removes the need for manual initialisation. A third advantage is that the motion-based automatic initialisation does not require overlapping field of view between sensors. The paper also provides a method to estimate the accuracy of the resulting calibration. We illustrate the generalisation of our approach and validate its performance by showing results with two contrasting datasets. The first dataset was collected in a city with a car platform, and the second one was collected in a tree-crop farm with a Segway platform."
icra,None,Estimating structure of indoor scene from a single full-view image,"Hanchao Jia,Shigang Li,","In this paper we propose a novel method of estimating indoor scenes from a single full-view image. On the one hand, the conventional methods cope with limited field of view images, such as perspective images and hemispherical omnidirectional images, which result in visually open boundary condition, called open geometry. On the other hand, a full-view image results in a visually close boundary condition, called close geometry. In this paper we employ the characteristics of close geometry to explore indoor scene understanding from a single full-view image. The proposed close geometry is tested in comparison with the conventional open geometry. The comparative experiment is also carried out between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art method [13]. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve a better performance, and imply that close geometry plays an important role on the interpretation of indoor scenes."

The system solves different tasks (semantic segmentation and object detections) in an opportunistic and distributed fashion but still allows communication between modules to improve their respective performances. We propose the use of the semantic space to improve specific out-of-the-box object detectors and an update model to take the evidence from different detection into account in the semantic segmentation process. Our proposal is evaluated with the KITTI dataset, on the object detection benchmark and on five different sequences manually annotated for the semantic segmentation task, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach."

We use the results of a Random Forest Classifier to initialize the unary potentials of a densely interconnected Conditional Random Field, for which we learn the parameters for the pairwise potentials from training data. These potentials capture and model common spatial relations between class labels, which can often be observed in indoor scenes. We evaluate our approach on the popular NYU Depth datasets, for which it achieves superior results compared to the current state of the art. Exploiting parallelization and applying an efficient CRF inference method based on mean field approximation, our framework is able to process full resolution Kinect point clouds in half a second on a regular laptop, more than twice as fast as comparable methods."
icra,None,Lifetime estimation of events from Dynamic Vision Sensors,"Elias Mueggler,Christian Forster,Nathan Baumli,Guillermo Gallego,,","We propose an algorithm to estimate the “lifetime” of events from retinal cameras, such as a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Unlike standard CMOS cameras, a DVS only transmits pixel-level brightness changes (“events”) at the time they occur with micro-second resolution. Due to its low latency and sparse output, this sensor is very promising for high-speed mobile robotic applications. We develop an algorithm that augments each event with its lifetime, which is computed from the event's velocity on the image plane. The generated stream of augmented events gives a continuous representation of events in time, hence enabling the design of new algorithms that outperform those based on the accumulation of events over fixed, artificially-chosen time intervals. A direct application of this augmented stream is the construction of sharp gradient (edge-like) images at any time instant. We successfully demonstrate our method in different scenarios, including high-speed quadrotor flips, and compare it to standard visualization methods."
icra,None,Semantically guided location recognition for outdoors scenes,"Arsalan Mousavian,Jana Košecká,Jyh-Ming Lien,","The problem of image based localization has a long history both in robotics and computer vision and shares many similarities with image based retrieval problem. Existing techniques use either local features or (semi)-global image signatures in the context of topological mapping or loop closure detection. Difficulties of the location recognition problem are often affected by large appearance and viewpoint variation between the query view and reference dataset and presence of non-discriminative features due to vegetation, sky and road. In this work we show that semantic segmentation labeling of man-made structures can inform the traditional bag-of-visual words models to obtain proper feature weighting and improve the overall location recognition accuracy. We also demonstrate additional capability of identifying individual buildings and estimating their extent in images, providing the essential building block for semantic localization. Towards this end we introduce a new challenging outdoors urban dataset exhibiting large variations in appearance and viewpoint."

Given an input video stream recorded while the robot is navigating, the user just needs to annotate a very small number of frames to build specific classifiers for each of the objects of interest. At the core of the method, there are several random ferns classifiers that share the same features and are updated online. The resulting methodology is fast (runs at 8 fps), versatile (it can be applied to unconstrained scenarios), scalable (real experiments show we can model up to 30 different object classes), and minimizes the amount of human intervention by leveraging the uncertainty measures associated to each classifier. We thoroughly validate the approach on synthetic data and on real sequences acquired with a mobile platform in outdoor and challenging scenarios containing a multitude of different objects. We show that the human can, with minimal effort, provide the robot with a detailed model of the objects in the scene."
icra,None,Evaluation of finger configuration for partial caging,"Satoshi Makita,Kazuyuki Nagata,","In caging, an object is geometrically confined by position-controlled robots and never escapes from the constraint. Caging has some advantages over conventional grasping, and its applications have been performed not only in 2D but also in 3D scenes with various actual robots. However, the conditions of complete caging are not always satisfied due to limited robot configuration. This paper studies partial caging, in which an object is incompletely confined by robots or obstacles and is able to escape from the constraint. As an example of partial caging, a circular object moving in the planar hand is considered. We investigate an effect of arrangement of its fingertips, which prevents the object from escaping outside through the gap between the fingertips. Some simulation results show differences of difficulty of escaping for the object according to width of the gap and angle of the fingers. In addition, ease of entering the hand through the gap of the fingers is also evaluated. From these two scores on partial caging, we define an ability index for the hand, which represents the hand can easily capture an object and confine it without any finger motion."
icra,None,Global grasp planning using triangular meshes,"Shuo Liu,Stefano Carpin,","In this paper we present an algorithm to determine the location of contact points to obtain force closure grasps on tree dimensional objects. The shape of the object is assumed to be given by a triangle mesh - a format widely used in CAD software. Our algorithm can handle an arbitrary number of contact points and does nor require any prior information about their initial locations. Through an iterative process, contact point locations are updated aiming at improving a commonly used grasp quality metric. The process is global in the sense that during the process the whole surface of the object can be explored, and contact point locations can cross sharp edges that usually represent a problem for optimization algorithms relying on smooth surface representations. Extensive simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed method, outlining strengths and directions for further research."
icra,None,An adaptive compliant multi-finger approach-to-grasp strategy for objects with position uncertainties,"Zhaopeng Chen,Thomas Wimböck,Maximo A. Roa,Benedikt Pleintinger,,,,,","This paper presents an adaptive and compliant approach-to-grasp strategy for multi-finger robotic hands, to improve the performance of autonomous grasping when encountering object position uncertainties. With the proposed approach-to-grasp strategy, the first robot finger to experience unexpected impact would pause its movement in a compliant manner, and remains in contact with the object to minimize the unplanned motion of the target object. At the same time, the remainder of the fingers continuously, adaptively move toward re-adjusted grasping positions with respect to the first finger in contact with the object, without the need for on-line re-planning or re-grasping. An adaptive grasp control strategy based on spatial virtual spring framework is proposed to achieve local (e.g. not resorting to the robotic arm) in-hand adjustments of the fingers not yet in contact. As such, these fingers can be adaptively driven to the adjusted desired position to accomplish the grasp. Experimental results demonstrate that significantly larger position errors with respect to the hand workspace can be accommodated with the proposed adaptive compliant grasp control strategy. As much as 391% increase in position error area coverage has been achieved. Finally, beyond the quantitative analysis, additional observations during the extensive experiment trials are discussed qualitatively, to help examine several open issues, and further understand the approach-to-grasp phases of the robot hand tasks."
icra,None,GP-GPIS-OPT: Grasp planning with shape uncertainty using Gaussian process implicit surfaces and Sequential Convex Programming,"Jeffrey Mahler,Sachin Patil,Ben Kehoe,Jur van den Berg,Matei Ciocarlie,,,","Computing grasps for an object is challenging when the object geometry is not known precisely. In this paper, we explore the use of Gaussian process implicit surfaces (GPISs) to represent shape uncertainty from RGBD point cloud observations of objects. We study the use of GPIS representations to select grasps on previously unknown objects, measuring grasp quality by the probability of force closure. Our main contribution is GP-GPIS-OPT, an algorithm for computing grasps for parallel-jaw grippers on 2D GPIS object representations. Specifically, our method optimizes an approximation to the probability of force closure subject to antipodal constraints on the parallel jaws using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). We also introduce GPIS-Blur, a method for visualizing 2D GPIS models based on blending shape samples from a GPIS. We test the algorithm on a set of 8 planar objects with transparency, translucency, and specularity. Our experiments suggest that GP-GPIS-OPT computes grasps with higher probability of force closure than a planner that does not consider shape uncertainty on our test objects and may converge to a grasp plan up to 5.7×faster than using Monte-Carlo integration, a common method for grasp planning under shape uncertainty. Furthermore, initial experiments on the Willow Garage PR2 robot suggest that grasps selected with GP-GPIS-OPT are up to 90% more successful than those planned assuming a deterministic shape. Our dataset, code, and videos of our experiments are available at http://rll.berkeley.edu/icra2015grasping/."
icra,None,Learning the tactile signatures of prototypical object parts for robust part-based grasping of novel objects,"Emil Hyttinen,Danica Kragic,Renaud Detry,","We present a robotic agent that learns to derive object grasp stability from touch. The main contribution of our work is the use of a characterization of the shape of the part of the object that is enclosed by the gripper to condition the tactile-based stability model. As a result, the agent is able to express that a specific tactile signature may for instance indicate stability when grasping a cylinder, while cuing instability when grasping a box. We proceed by (1) discretizing the space of graspable object parts into a small set of prototypical shapes, via a data-driven clustering process, and (2) learning a touch-based stability classifier for each prototype. Classification is conducted through kernel logistic regression, applied to a low-dimensional approximation of the tactile data read from the robot's hand. We present an experiment that demonstrates the applicability of the method, yielding a success rate of 89%. Our experiment also shows that the distribution of tactile data differs substantially between grasps collected with different prototypes, supporting the use of shape cues in touch-based stability estimators."
icra,None,Functional power grasps transferred through warping and replanning,"Theodoros Stouraitis,Ulrich Hillenbrand,Máximo A. Roa,","This paper presents a method to transfer functional grasps among objects of the same category through contact warping and local replanning. The method transfers implicit knowledge that enables an action on a class of objects for which no explicit grasp or task information has been given in advance. Contact points on the source object are warped based on global and local shape similarities to the target object. These warped contacts are then used to define a hand posture that reaches close to them, while at the same time provides the desired functionality on the object. The approach is tested on different sets of objects with a success rate of 87.5%, and large benefits are shown when compared to a naive technique that only transfers a suitable hand pose to the novel object."
icra,None,Modeling compliant grasps exploiting environmental constraints,"Gionata Salvietti,Monica Malvezzi,Guido Gioioso,Domenico Prattichizzo,","In this paper we present a mathematical framework to describe the interaction between compliant hands and environmental constraints during grasping tasks. In the proposed model, we considered compliance at wrist, joint and contact level. We modeled the general case in which the hand is in contact with the object and the surrounding environment. All the other contact cases can be derived from the proposed system of equations. We performed several numerical simulation using the SynGrasp Matlab Toolbox to prove the consistency of the proposed model. We tested different combinations of compliance as well as different reference inputs for the hand/arm system considered. This work has to be intended as a tool for compliant hand designer since it allows to tune compliance at different levels before the real hand realization. Furthermore, the same framework can be used for compliant hand simulation in order to study the interaction with the environmental constrains and to plan complex manipulation tasks."
icra,None,Planning grasp strategies That Exploit Environmental Constraints,"Clemens Eppner,Oliver Brock,","There is strong evidence that robustness in human and robotic grasping can be achieved through the deliberate exploitation of contact with the environment. In contrast to this, traditional grasp planners generally disregard the opportunity to interact with the environment during grasping. In this paper, we propose a novel view of grasp planning that centers on the exploitation of environmental contact. In this view, grasps are sequences of constraint exploitations, i.e. consecutive motions constrained by features in the environment, ending in a grasp. To be able to generate such grasp plans, it becomes necessary to consider planning, perception, and control as tightly integrated components. As a result, each of these components can be simplified while still yielding reliable grasping performance. We propose a first implementation of a grasp planner based on this view and demonstrate in real-world experiments the robustness and versatility of the resulting grasp plans."
icra,None,Sensor-aided teleoperated grasping of transparent objects,"Kevin Huang,Liang-Ting Jiang,Joshua R. Smith,Howard Jay Chizeck,","This paper presents a method of augmenting streaming point cloud data with pretouch proximity sensor information for the purposes of teleoperated grasping of transparent targets. When using commercial RGB-Depth (RGB-D) cameras, material properties can significantly affect depth measurements. In particular, transparent objects are difficult to perceive with RGB images and commercially available depth sensors. Geometric information of such objects needs to be gathered with additional sensors, and in many scenarios, it is of interest to gather this information without physical contact. In this work, a non-contact pretouch sensor fixed to the robot end effector is used to sense and explore physical geometries previously unobserved. Thus, the point cloud representation of an unknown, transparent grasp target, can be enhanced through telerobotic exploration in real-time. Furthermore, real-time haptic rendering algorithms and haptic virtual fixtures used in combination with the augmented streaming point clouds assist the teleoperator in collision avoidance during exploration. Theoretical analyses are performed to design virtual fixtures suitable for pretouch sensing, and experiments show the effectiveness of this method to gather geometry data without collision and eventually to successfully grasp a transparent object."
icra,None,A robotic exoskeleton for rehabilitation and assessment of the upper limb following incomplete spinal cord injury,"Kyle D. Fitle,Ali Utku Pehlivan,Marcia K. O'Malley,","Robotic devices have been shown to be efficacious in the delivery of therapy to treat upper limb motor impairment following stroke. However, the application of this technology to other types of neurological injury has been limited to case studies. In this paper, we present a multi degree of freedom robotic exoskeleton, the MAHI Exo II, intended for rehabilitation of the upper limb following incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). We present details about the MAHI Exo II and initial findings from a clinical evaluation of the device with eight subjects with incomplete SCI who completed a multi-session training protocol. Clinical assessments show significant gains when comparing pre- and post-training performance in functional tasks. This paper explores a range of robotic measures capturing movement quality and smoothness that may be useful in tracking performance, providing as feedback to the subject, or incorporating into an adaptive training protocol. Advantages and disadvantages of the various investigated measures are discussed with regard to the type of movement segmentation that can be applied to the data collected during unassisted movements where the robot is backdriven and encoder data is recorded for post-processing."
icra,None,A soft exoskeleton for hand assistive and rehabilitation application using pneumatic actuators with variable stiffness,"Hong Kai Yap,Jeong Hoon Lim,Fatima Nasrallah,James C. H. Goh,,","In this paper, we present the design of a soft wearable exoskeleton that comprises of a glove embedded with pneumatic actuators of variable stiffness for hand assistive and rehabilitation application. The device is lightweight and easily wearable due to the usage of soft pneumatic actuators. A key feature of the device is the variable stiffness of the actuators at different localities that not only conform to the finger profile during actuation, but also provides customizability for different hand dimensions. The actuators can achieve different bending profiles with variable stiffness implemented at different localities. Therefore, the device is able to perform different hand therapy exercises such as full fist, straight fist, hook fist and table top. The device was characterized in terms of its range of motion and maximum force output. Experiments were conducted to examine the differences between active and passive actuation. The results showed that the device could achieve hand grasping and pinching with acceptable range of motion and force."
icra,None,Thin and active fixture to hold finger for easy attachment and comfort of grasping support exoskeleton,"Yasuhisa Hasegawa,Takeshi Suzuki,","This paper proposes a new thin fixture that improves comfortableness and makes it easy for a user to wear a grasping support exoskeleton. Easiness of wear is one of important factors for the system performance improvement in addition to physical support functions of the system. The fixture consists of a C-shaped SMA wire and an air chamber. The SMA wire generates a holding force to fix the exoskeleton to a user's finger. The air chamber deforms the SMA wire to open its ends for attachment and detachment. This fixture reduces wearer's burden due to a lightweight, about 1[g], and no hindrance of a finger motion due to thin profile, 2[mm]. The fixture is evaluated through some experiments from the viewpoint of holding force, contact pressure, finger skin temperature, attaching time and detaching time. This fixture can maintain blood flow by changing the holding force that depends on pressure of compressed air. Time spent for donning and doffing a grasping force support system becomes 80 or more percent shorter than one of Velcro."
icra,None,Elbow joint motion support for C4 level cervical cord injury patient using an exoskeleton robot,"Shogo Tominaga,Hiroyuki Nakamura,Naoto Mizutani,Ryota Sakamoto,,,,","We previously proposed a motion support robot and conducted experiments in which a C5-level cervical cord injury patient used the system. This paper proposes to offer motion support to a C4-level spinal cord injury patient who suffers from paralysis of the limbs. Electromyogram (EMG) signals are used to determine the user's intentions. The proposed motion assist robot can then support flexion and extension at the elbow joint. Using frequency analysis of the EMG signal, the patient's intention can be estimated in real time, and the coefficient of viscosity is varied in an admittance controller. With the proposed motion assist method, we were able to realize arbitrary upper limb motion of a C4-level cervical cord injury patient."
icra,None,Estimating joint movements from observed EMG signals with multiple electrodes under sensor failure situations toward safe assistive robot control,"Jun-ichiro Furukawa,Tomoyuki Noda,Tatsuya Teramae,Jun Morimoto,","In this paper, we propose an estimation method of human joint movements from measured EMG signals for assistive robot control. We focus on how to estimate joint movements using multiple EMG electrodes even under sensor failure situations. In real world applications, EMG sensor electrodes might become disconnected or detached from skin surfaces. If we consider EMG-based robot control for assistive robots, such sensor failures lead to significant errors in the estimation of user joint movements. To cope with these sensor failures, we propose a state estimation model that takes uncertain observations into account. Sensor channel anomalies are found by checking the covariance of the EMG signals measured by multiple EMG electrodes. To validate the proposed control framework, we artificially disconnect an EMG electrode or detach one side of an EMG probe from the skin surface during elbow joint movement estimation. We show proper control of a one-DOF exoskeleton robot based on the estimated joint torque using our proposed method even when one EMG electrode has a sensor problem; a standard method with no tolerability against uncertain observations was unable to deal with these fault situations. Furthermore, the errors of the estimated joint torque with our proposed method were smaller than the standard method or a method with a conventional sensor fault detection algorithm."
icra,None,Mechanical design of a gravity-balancing wearable exoskeleton for the motion enhancement of human upper limb,"Hsiang-Chien Hsieh,Li Chien,Chao-Chieh Lan,","Powered exoskeletons can provide motion enhancement for both healthy and physically challenged people. Upper limb exoskeletons are required to have multiple degrees-of-freedom and can still produce sufficient force to augment the upper limb motion. The design using serial mechanisms usually results in a complicated and bulky exoskeleton that prevents itself from being wearable. This paper presents a new exoskeleton design aimed to achieve compactness and wearability. We consider a shoulder exoskeleton that consists of a parallel spherical mechanism with two slider crank mechanisms. The actuators can be placed on a stationary platform and attached closely to human body. Thus a better inertia property can be obtained while maintaining lightweight. Through the use of a gravity-balancing mechanism, the required actuator power becomes smaller and with better efficiency. A static model is developed to analyze and optimize the exoskeleton. Through illustrations of a prototype, the exoskeleton is shown to be wearable and can provide adequate motion enhancement of a human's upper limb."
icra,None,An underactuated wearable arm-swing rehabilitator for gait training,"Owen R. Barnes,Babak Hejrati,Jake J. Abbott,","This paper presents the design concept and fabricated prototype of a device that swings the arms for use in gait rehabilitation. The device is designed to be used in conjunction with a body-weight-support treadmill. The device is backdrivable, wearable, capable of assisting the user's arm swing in the sagittal plane, and has unhindered kinematics in the remaining unactuated degrees of freedom. Tests are performed to validate the shoulder-angle prediction equations based on the non-collocated motor-angle sensor measurements, to validate the device's ability to provide adequate torque to induce arm-swing in a passive user, and to investigate whether or not the user's active involvement can be determined by examining sensor data. The results show that the device does provide sufficient torque to move the arms with a factor of safety, but that the model-based shoulder-angle estimates obtained from the motor measurements have non-negligible error with the current prototype. It is shown that the controlled device generates low RMS tracking error and is able to diagnose user-assistance level (i.e., if the user is passive or actively assisting arm swing) online by observing shoulder-angle amplitudes and peak motor torques."
icra,None,Investigation on the control strategy of soft wearable robotic hand with slack enabling tendon actuator,"Useok Jeong,Hyunki In,Haemin Lee,Brian Byunghyun Kang,Kyu-Jin Cho,","A soft wearable robot, which is an emerging type of wearable robot, can take advantage of tendon-driven mechanisms with a Bowden cable. These tendon-driven mechanisms benefits soft wearable robots because the actuator can be remotely placed and the transmission is very compact. However, it is difficult to compensate the friction along the Bowden cable which makes it hard to control. This study proposes the use of a position-based impedance controller, which is robust to the nonlinear dynamics of the system and provides compliant interaction between robot, human, and environment. Additionally, to eliminate disturbances from unexpected tension of the antagonistic wire arising from friction, this study proposes a new type of slack enabling tendon actuator. It can eliminate friction force along the antagonistic wire by actively pushing the wire while preventing derailment of the wire from the spool."
icra,None,Design and control of Supernumerary Robotic Limbs for balance augmentation,"Federico Parietti,Kameron C. Chan,Banks Hunter,H. Harry Asada,","This paper presents a novel approach to balance assistance and joint load reduction for human bipedal walking. We introduce a new type of wearable robot, called Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), that provides two additional legs for augmenting stability and reducing the loads on human leg joints. Unlike exoskeletons, the SRL is kinematically independent of the human skeletal structure, and can therefore take an arbitrary posture to provide optimal assistance in coordination with human motions. Furthermore, unlike crutches, canes, and other balance assistance equipment, the SRL can provide balancing support autonomously and thereby free the human arms from holding those tools. First, the new design concept and balance assistance strategy are described, followed by kinematic and static modeling. Two gate patterns of the combined human and SRL are discussed. Optimal gate synthesis that maximizes the area of support polygon is discussed. Finally, the gate control strategies are implemented on a prototype SRL, using body motion sensors to enable real-time, seamless coordination between the user and the robot."
icra,None,Event-based estimation and control for remote robot operation with reduced communication,"Sebastian Trimpe,Jonas Buchli,","An event-based communication framework for remote operation of a robot via a bandwidth-limited network is proposed. The robot sends state and environment estimation data to the operator, and the operator transmits updated control commands or policies to the robot. Event-based communication protocols are designed to ensure that data is transmitted only when required: the robot sends new estimation data only if this yields a significant information gain at the operator, and the operator transmits an updated control policy only if this comes with a significant improvement in control performance. The developed framework is modular and can be used with any standard estimation and control algorithms. Simulation results of a robotic arm highlight its potential for an efficient use of limited communication resources, for example, in disaster-response scenarios such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge."

It compensates internal friction of the gear and the counter-electromotive torque by combining a model-based feed-forward method and a disturbance observer using a cheap torque sensor. A complementary use of those techniques lowers requirements to their performances i.e. precision, bandwidth, etc, while it is equipped with a flexible property against the external torque. A 2-DOF servo controller is also built upon the system in order to simultaneously achieve smooth responses and robust convergences to the reference."
icra,None,Modeling of movement control architectures based on motion primitives using domain-specific languages,"Arne Nordmann,Sebastian Wrede,Jochen Steil,","This paper introduces a model-driven approach for engineering complex movement control architectures based on motion primitives, which in recent years have been a central development towards adaptive and flexible control of complex and compliant robots. We consider rich motor skills realized through the composition of motion primitives as our domain. In this domain we analyze the control architectures of representative example systems to identify common abstractions. It turns out that the introduced notion of motion primitives implemented as dynamical systems with machine learning capabilities, provide the computational building block for a large class of such control architectures. Building on the identified concepts, we introduce domain-specific languages that allow the compact specification of movement control architectures based on motion primitives and their coordination respectively. Using a proper tool chain, we show how to employ this model-driven approach in a case study for the real world example of automatic laundry grasping with the KUKA LWR-IV, where executable source-code is automatically generated from the domain-specific language specification."
icra,None,Robotic agent programming in TeleoR,"Keith L. Clark,Peter J. Robinson,","We present an extension, TeleoR, of Nilsson's Teleo-Reactive (TR) rule based robotic agent programming language[22]. For both languages programs essentially comprise sequences of Guard ~>Action rules grouped into parameterised procedures. The Guard is a deductive query to a set of rapidly changing percept facts generated from the most recent sensor values. For TR, the Action is either a tuple of primitive robotic actions, to be executed in parallel, or a single call to a program procedure, which can be a recursive call, or a BeliefStoreupdate. TeleoR has extra forms of action. The procedures encode goal (teleo) directed reactive task and sub-task behaviours of robotic agents. TR/TeleoR programs are robust and opportunity grabbing, and so are well suited to human/robot or robot/robot co-operative tasks requiring flexible behaviour. TeleoR, extends TR in having: types and higher order features; extra forms of action rules that temporarily inhibit other rules in the same procedure; repeatable sequences of time capped actions; wait/repeat re-start of failed actions; belief store update and message send actions linked with any rule; a flexibly typed higher order LP/FP programming language for BeliefStore inference; support for the high level programming of multi-tasking agents that interleave the use of subsets of a set of independent robotic resources. All the extensions were driven by application needs. The use of QuLog enables us to guarantee by compiler analysis that all guarded rule actions will be fully instantiated and correctly typed when sent to a robot, perhaps via a ROS interface. The focus of this paper is on the extensions for single task communicating robotic agents. Our goal was to extend TR without losing the elegance and simplicity of Nilsson's language. We also wanted to be able to give the extended language a formally defined operational semantics, building upon one we had given for TR. The extensions, their semantics, and their implementation were dev..."
icra,None,Adaptive saccade controller inspired by the primates' cerebellum,"Marco Antonelli,Angel J. Duran,Eris Chinellato,Angel P. del Pobil,","Saccades are fast eye movements that allow humans and robots to bring the visual target in the center of the visual field. Saccades are open loop with respect to the vision system, thus their execution require a precise knowledge of the internal model of the oculomotor system. In this work, we modeled the saccade control, taking inspiration from the recurrent loops between the cerebellum and the brainstem. In this model, the brainstem acts as a fixed-inverse model of the oculomotor system, while the cerebellum acts as an adaptive element that learns the internal model of the oculomotor system. The adaptive filter is implemented using a state-of-the-art neural network, called I-SSGPR. The proposed approach, namely recurrent architecture, was validated through experiments performed both in simulation and on an antropomorphic robotic head. Moreover, we compared the recurrent architecture with another model of the cerebellum, the feedback error learning. Achieved results show that the recurrent architecture outperforms the feedback error learning in terms of accuracy and insensitivity to the choice of the feedback controller."
icra,None,Robotic cognitive behavior control based on biology-inspired Episodic memory,"Dong Liu,Ming Cong,Yu Du,Xiaodong Han,","This paper proposes a framework called Episodic memory-driving Markov decision processes (EM-MDPs) for incremental self-learning of robotic experience and cognitive behavior control under uncertainty. The framework simulates the organization process of episodic memory by introducing the neuron stimulation mechanism. Firstly, episode model is built, and the activation and stimulation mechanism of state neurons is proposed based on cognitive neuroscience. Secondly, episodic self-learning is also proposed by utilizing sparse distributed memory (SDM) through Hebbian rules, to realize memory real-time storage, incremental accumulation and integration. Finally, a robotic cognitive behavior control approach is established. Neuron synaptic potential is introduced for event localization. Robot can evaluate the past events sequence, predict the current state and plan the desired behavior. Two main challenges in robot behavior control under uncertainty are addressed in the paper: high computational complexity and perceptual aliasing. The proposed system is evaluated in several real life environments for mobile robot. The applicability and the usefulness of the developed method are validated by the results obtained."
icra,None,A self organization approach to goal-directed multimodal locomotion based on Attractor Selection Mechanism,"Yongjae Kim,Surya G. Nurzaman,Fumiya Iida,Edwardo F. Fukushima,","The realization and utilization of multimodal locomotion to enable robots to accomplish useful tasks is a significantly challenging problem in robotics. Related to the challenge, it is crucial to notice that the locomotion dynamics of the robots is a result of interactions between a particular control structure and its body-environment dynamics. From this perspective, this paper presents a simple control structure known as Attractor Selection Mechanism that enables a robot to self organize its multiple locomotion modes for accomplishing a goal-directed locomotion task. Despite the simplicity, the approach enables the robot to automatically explore different body-environment dynamics and stabilize onto particular attractors which corresponds to locomotion modes relevant to accomplish the task. The robot used throughout the paper is a curved-beam hopping robot, which despite its simple actuation method, possesses rich and complex body-environment dynamics."

These characteristics may be useful in micromanipulation, endoscopic robotic-assisted surgery, and human-robot interaction. Our prior work formulated a kinematic model which treats a parallel continuum robot as a set of multiple Cosserat rods with coupled boundary conditions. In this paper, we detail methods for the efficient numerical solution of this model at rates that enable real-time interactive simulation, motion planning, design optimization, and control. Exploitation of the model structure enables a significant reduction in the number of integrations required to evaluate the boundary value Jacobian matrix used in a shooting method. Our approach is used to teleoperate a prototype robot using real-time inverse kinematics solutions, and simulation tests show that inverse kinematics solutions are consistently computed at rates of several kilohertz using standard desktop computing hardware."

This work proposes a scheduler as an interface between a discrete, symbolic plan and a motion control based on constraint optimization. Acting as a local reasoner, the scheduler valuates a set of predicates to decide when an action will be executed. Given a task specification which describes how the action should be realized, the scheduler configures the controller at runtime. A demonstration will be provided considering an “open drawer” scenario."
icra,None,Feasible Center of Mass Dynamic Manipulability of humanoid robots,"Yan Gu,Bin Yao,C.S. George Lee,","Locomotion stability of a humanoid robot is closely related to the capacity to regulate its Center of Mass (CoM) motion. In this paper, the Feasible Center of Mass Dynamic Manipulability (FCDM) is introduced and analyzed as a measure of this capacity. The effects of posture, joint velocities and gravity on the torque-bounded dynamic manipulability ellipsoid are first analyzed on an n-DOF planar humanoid robot with single-foot support. The ellipse orientation has a linear relationship with the ankle angle, and its shape is independent on the ankle angle. Furthermore, three common and important ground-contact constraints - the unilateral contact-force constraint, the friction constraint, and the Center of Pressure constraint - are incorporated in the derivation of FCDM. It shows geometrically how each of the three constraints shrinks the original torque-bounded manipulability polytope and affects the maximum achievable CoM acceleration in different directions. Finally, a push recovery task was simulated to show that a robot's posture affects the feasible range of the CoM acceleration in a specific direction."
icra,None,Self-stabilization of 3D walking via vertical oscillations of the hip,"Christine Chevallereau,Yannick Aoustin,","Actual control of most humanoid robots is based on the 3D linear inverted pendulum and assumes an horizontal displacement of the center of mass of the robot while obviously the center of mass in human walking is characterized by vertical oscillations. The objective of the paper is to show that these oscillations have a crucial role for the high level control of the walk. Based on a controlled length inverted pendulum model of the walker, it will be shown that vertical oscillations induce a self stabilization of the walk while this self stabilization is not observed in the case of a horizontal motion of the center of mass. The results are essentially based on the evolution of the angular momentum throughout the walk. The decrease of the angular momentum during the change of support is determinant to introduce a dependence between the path of the center of mass and the walking velocity. For a large set of walking characteristics (stride, velocity ...) a self synchronization of the motion in the sagittal and frontal planes appears that allows a low level control to produce stable cyclic gaits."
icra,None,Fall Prediction of legged robots based on energy state and its implication of balance augmentation: A study on the humanoid,"Zhibin Li,Chengxu Zhou,Juan Castano,Xin Wang,Francesca Negrello,,,","In this paper, we propose an Energy based Fall Prediction (EFP) which observes the real-time balance status of a humanoid robot during standing. The EFP provides an analytic and quantitative measure of the level of balance. Both simulation and experimental studies were conducted and compared with the previously proposed indicators, such as Capture Point (CP) and Foot Rotation Indicator (FRI). The EFP also suggests the balance augmentation by active foot tilting to create larger potential barriers. As a proof of concept, a hybrid balance controller was designed to stabilize the robot including under-actuation phases so the robot can also balance with shoes. Our study reveals that both EFP and CP successfully predict falling about 0.2s in advance for the tested robot, while the FRI fails due to the light weight of the foot and limited resolution of the force/torque measurement."
icra,None,Touch-down angle control for spring-mass walking,"Hamid Reza Vejdani,Albert Wu,Hartmut Geyer,Jonathan W Hurst,","In this paper we propose the fastest converging control policy (also known as deadbeat control) for walking with the bipedal spring-mass model, which serves as an abstraction of a robot on compliant legs. To fully leverage the passive dynamics of the system, the touchdown angle of the swing-leg is assigned as the only control input of the system. We show that two steps (or one stride) are necessary and sufficient to converge to target walking gaits. We first analyze the dynamics of the system to identify the limit cycles as well as the limitations of the control authority within the definition of walking. Then, we present the two-step deadbeat control policy that guarantees stability with the fastest possible convergence rate for the system. For each equilibrium gait, the basin of attraction in which this two-step control exists is a measure of the robustness of the system. The simulation results show that human-like walking gaits (double hump ground reaction force profile) have relatively large basins of attraction. Finally, we extend the policy to various energy levels to accommodate walking on uneven ground that has height changes. We show in simulation that the system indeed rejects various disturbances and converges to the desired equilibrium gait in two steps."

Thus, a crucial question for them is to anticipate whether a contact will hold or break under effort. For rigid surface contacts, existing methods usually consider several point-contact forces, which has some drawbacks due to the underlying redundancy. We derive a criterion, the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC), which is equivalent to any number of applied forces on the contact surface, and for which we provide a closed-form formula. It turns out that the CWC can be decomposed into three conditions: (i) Coulomb friction on the resultant force, (ii) CoP inside the support area, and (iii) upper and lower bounds on the yaw torque. While the first two are well-known, the third one is novel. It can, for instance, be used to prevent the undesired foot yaws observed in biped locomotion. We show that our formula yields simpler and faster computations than existing approaches for humanoid motions in single support, and assess its validity in the OpenHRP simulator."
icra,None,Do limit cycles matter in the long run? Stable orbits and sliding-mass dynamics emerge in task-optimal locomotion,"Christian Hubicki,Mikhail Jones,Monica Daley,Jonathan Hurst,","We investigate the task-optimality of legged limit cycles and present numerical evidence supporting a simple general locomotion-planning template. Limit cycles have been foundational to the control and analysis of legged systems, but as robots move toward completing real-world tasks, are limit cycles practical in the long run? We address this question both figuratively and literally by solving for optimal strategies for long-horizon tasks spanning as many as 20 running steps. These scenarios were designed to embody practical locomotion tasks, such as evading a pursuer, and were formulated with minimal constraints (complete the task, minimize energy cost, and don't fall). By leveraging large-scale constrained optimization techniques, we numerically solve the trajectory for a reduced-order running model to optimally complete each scenario. We find, in the tested scenarios in flat terrain, that near-limit-cycle behaviors emerge after a transient period of acceleration and deceleration, suggesting limit cycles may be a useful, near-optimal planning target. On rough terrain, enforcing a limit cycle on every step only degrades gait economy by 2-5% compared to optimal 20-step look-ahead planning. When perturbing the scenario with a single “bump” in the road, the model converged in a manner giving the appearance of an exponentially stable orbit, despite not explicitly enforcing exponential stability. Further, we show that the transient periods of acceleration and deceleration may be near-optimally approximated by planning with a simple “sliding mass” template. These results support the notion that limit cycles can be useful approximations of task-optimal behavior, and thus are useful near-term targets for long-term planning."
icra,None,Model predictive control of underactuated bipedal robotic walking,"Matthew J. Powell,Eric A. Cousineau,Aaron D. Ames,","This paper addresses the problem of controlling underactuated bipedal walking robots in the presence of actuator torque saturation. The proposed method synthesizes elements of the Human-Inspired Control (HIC) approach for generating provably-stable walking controllers, rapidly exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov functions (RES-CLFs) and standard model predictive control (MPC). Specifically, the proposed controller uses feedback linearization to construct a linear control system describing the dynamics of the walking outputs. The input to this linear system is designed to be the solution of a MPC-based Quadratic Program which minimizes the sum of the values of a RES-CLF-describing the walking control objectives-over a finite-time horizon. Future values of the torque constraints are mapped into the linear control system using the Hybrid Zero Dynamics property of HIC and subsequently incorporated in the Quadratic Program. The proposed method is implemented in a rigid-body dynamics simulation and initial experiments with the Durus robot."
icra,None,Online iterative learning control of zero-moment point for biped walking stabilization,"Kai Hu,Christian Ott,Dongheui Lee,","Biped walking control based on simplified models relies much on online feedback stabilizers to compensate the zero-moment point (ZMP) error which partially comes from the model inconsistency of pattern generation. Inspired by the fact that human improves the performance by practicing a task for multiple times, this paper presents an online learning control framework for improving the robustness during the dominant repetitive phases of walking. The key idea is to learn a compensative feedforward ZMP term from previous ZMP error trajectories in order to achieve better ZMP tracking. Based on the iterative learning control theory, the learning process is conducted online continuously with minimal iteration of two footsteps, which can practically run in parallel with state-of-the-art walking controllers. A varying forgetting factor is designed to reduce the influence of the landing impact. Convergence of the learning control algorithm and improved ZMP tracking performance is verified both in dynamics simulation and experiment on the DLR humanoid robot TORO."

It is based on two linear model predictive controllers, managed by a tilt supervisor, which detects changes of the dynamic model caused by the tilt of the robot. Experimental results are proposed on the robot Pepper made by Aldebaran, showing good performance in term of stability an robustness."
icra,None,Energetics-informed hexapod gait transitions across terrains,"Navinda Kottege,Callum Parkinson,Peyman Moghadam,Alberto Elfes,,","Legged robots offer the potential of locomotion across various types of terrains. Different terrains require different gait patterns to enable greater traversal efficiency. Consequently, as a legged robot transitions from one type of terrain to another, the gait pattern should be adapted so as to maximise traction and energy efficiency. This paper explores the use of power consumption as estimated by the robot in real-time for guiding this gait transition in the case of statically-stable locomotion. While moving, the robot autonomously assesses its power consumption, relates it to the traction, and switches between gaits so as to maximise efficiency. In this way, the robot only needs proprioceptive sensors and consequently does not require velocity estimation, ground imaging or profiling to maintain efficient locomotion across different terrains. The approach has been tested on a hexapod robot traversing a variety of terrain types and stiffness, including concrete, grass, mulch and leaf litter. The experimental results show that gait switching on energetics alone enables traction maintenance and efficient locomotion across different terrains. We also present comparisons between the power consumption metric used in this work and cost of transport which is used in the literature for characterising energetics for legged locomotion."
icra,None,Planning and execution of dynamic whole-body locomotion for a hydraulic quadruped on challenging terrain,"Alexander W. Winkler,Carlos Mastalli,Ioannis Havoutis,Michele Focchi,,,","We present a framework for dynamic quadrupedal locomotion over challenging terrain, where the choice of appropriate footholds is crucial for the success of the behaviour. We build a model of the environment on-line and on-board using an efficient occupancy grid representation. We use Any-time-Repairing A* (ARA*) to search over a tree of possible actions, choose a rough body path and select the locally-best footholds accordingly. We run a n-step lookahead optimization of the body trajectory using a dynamic stability metric, the Zero Moment Point (ZMP), that generates natural dynamic whole-body motions. A combination of floating-base inverse dynamics and virtual model control accurately executes the desired motions on an actively compliant system. Experimental trials show that this framework allows us to traverse terrains at nearly 6 times the speed of our previous work, evaluated over the same set of trials."
icra,None,Autonomous gait selection for energy efficient walking,"Sandeep Manjanna,Gregory Dudek,","In this paper, we investigate the question of how a legged robot can walk efficiently by taking advantage of its ability to alter its gait as a function of statistical (large-scale) terrain properties. One of the contributions of this paper is the algorithm to achieve real-time terrain identification and autonomous gait adaptation on a legged robot. We approach this problem by first classifying the terrains based on their proprioceptive responses and identifying the terrain in real-time. Then we choose an optimal gait to best suit the identified terrain type. We exploit our recent findings regarding gaits, estimated from terrain-contact signatures, in order to obtain an optimized mapping between terrain signatures and terrain-specific gaits. We evaluate our algorithm on synthetic data, and real robot data collected on different terrains and naturally occurring terrain transitions. Another key contribution of this work is the statistical verification that precise gait selection can lead to energy savings in practice in legged robots. This assessment of energy efficiency, achieved by gait adaptation, is among the firsts of its kind in gait adaptation literature. We also present an analysis of the effect of terrain transition frequency on our gait adaptation algorithm. Our results are supported by validation using both synthetic data and field testing."
icra,None,Variable-speed quadrupedal bounding using impulse planning: Untethered high-speed 3D Running of MIT Cheetah 2,"Hae-Won Park,Sangin Park,Sangbae Kim,","This paper introduces a bounding gait control algorithm that allows a variable-speed running in the MIT Cheetah 2. A simple impulse planning algorithm is proposed to design vertical and horizontal force profiles which make net impulse on the system during one cycle zero. This design of force profiles leads to the conservation of linear momentum over a complete step, providing periodicity in horizontal and vertical velocity. When designed profiles are applied to the system, periodic orbits with an ability to change running speed are obtained. A virtual compliance control in the horizontal and vertical direction has been added onto the designed force profiles to stabilize the periodic orbits. The experimental results show that the algorithm successfully achieved untethered 3D running of the MIT Cheetah 2, with speeds ranging from 0 m/sec to 4.5 m/sec on treadmills as well as on grassy fields."
icra,None,Stabilizing task-based omnidirectional quadruped locomotion with Virtual Model Control,"Michael J. Kuhlman,Joe Hays,Donald Sofge,Satyandra K. Gupta,","Quadruped locomotion offers significant advantages over wheeled locomotion for small mobile robots operating in challenging terrain. Central pattern generators (CPGs), as found in the neural circuitry of many animals, may be used to generate joint trajectories for quadruped robots. However, basic CPG-based trajectories do not explicitly consider ground contact constraints, a particular concern during turning maneuvers when foot slip is most likely to occur. An alternative approach proposed here is to use task-based CPGs such that ground contact constraints are enforced and foot velocities are explicitly controlled, resulting in stable omnidirectional locomotion. Further, incorporating Virtual Model Control with the task-based CPG trajectories improves the stability of the quadruped in hardware experiments."
icra,None,A torque-actuated dissipative spring loaded inverted pendulum model with rolling contact and its use as the template for design and dynamic behavior generation on a hexapod robot,"Chia-Jui Hu,Chun-Kai Huang,Pei-Chun Lin,","We report on a model-based approach for robot design and its dynamic motion generation. A new torque-actuated dissipative spring loaded inverted pendulum model with rolling contact (TDR-SLIP) is proposed to serve as the motion template for the robot. It is a successor to a previously developed spring loaded inverted pendulum model with rolling contact (R-SLIP) model but with embedded energy flow, which has better mapping to empirical robots. The stability properties of the TDR-SLIP model are analyzed, and its stable motion trajectory is implemented on the robot as the control guidance. The robot leg is developed according to the morphology and function of the TDR-SLIP leg, which acts as the design guidance. The proposed model-based approach is experimentally evaluated and finds that the robot is able to exhibit running behavior with various speeds and leg mechanics settings."
icra,None,Model-based dynamic gait generation for a leg-wheel transformable robot,"Hung-Sheng Lin,Wei-Hsi Chen,Pei-Chun Lin,","We report on the model-based approach to dynamic trotting and pronking gait generation for a leg-wheel transformable robot. The rolling spring-loaded inverted pendulum (R-SLIP) model served as the template for robot locomotion by programming the robot's motion according to the stable fixed-point trajectories of the model. Two strategies are developed to match the robot leg motions to the virtual model leg: First, using the two active degrees of freedom on each leg to simulate the passive spring effect of the R-SLIP model leg. Second, installing a torsion spring on the leg-wheel module to render the leg-wheel morphology identical to that of the model leg. This model-based approach to dynamic behavior generation for the robot is experimentally evaluated. The robot can successfully generate an R-SLIP-like stable pronking gait with a flight phase."
icra,None,High-speed biped walking using swinging-arms based on principle of up-and-down wobbling mass,"Yuta Hanazawa,Fumihiko Asano,","In this paper, we propose a novel speeding-up method for biped walking using a swinging-arms motion based on the principle of an up-and-down wobbling mass. We have shown that biped robots with a wobbling mass can achieve fast walking using an active up-and-down motion of the wobbling mass. We have also shown that the active up-and-down motion increases walking speed of biped robots. We apply this principle to a biped robot with two linked arms like humans for achieving high-speed limit cycle walking. We show that the proposed method achieves high-speed limit cycle walking of biped robots with arms."
icra,None,Design and analysis of an optimal hopper for use in resonance-based locomotion,"Ivor Wanders,Gerrit A. Folkertsma,Stefano Stramigioli,","Quadrupedal running is an efficient form of locomotion found in nature, which serves as an inspiration for robotics. We believe that a resonance-based approach is the path towards energy-efficient legged locomotion and running robots. The first step in working towards this goal is creating an energy-efficient one-legged hopper. Such a one-legged hopper was designed and constructed. The impact efficiency of the mechanism is calculated analytically, determined in simulation and measured with the prototype. The impact efficiency as calculated from the experiments is found to be in agreement with the analytical expectation and simulation results. Finally, using an electric motor to inject energy by creating a virtual spring with reverse hysteresis, hopping is achieved."
icra,None,Robust inference for visual-inertial sensor fusion,"Konstantine Tsotsos,Alessandro Chiuso,Stefano Soatto,","Inference of three-dimensional motion from the fusion of inertial and visual sensory data has to contend with the preponderance of outliers in the latter. Robust filtering deals with the joint inference and classification task of selecting which data fits the model, and estimating its state. We derive the optimal discriminant and propose several approximations, some used in the literature, others new. We compare them analytically, by pointing to the assumptions underlying their approximations, and empirically. We show that the best performing method improves the performance of state-of-the-art visual-inertial sensor fusion systems, while retaining the same computational complexity."
icra,None,Optimally observable and minimal cardinality monocular SLAM,"Guangcong Zhang,Patricio A. Vela,","This paper utilizes system observability to guide monocular SLAM. Instead of providing all measured features then performing data-driven outlier rejection (such as with RANSAC), we propose to identify only the minimal subset of features which form an optimally observable SLAM subsystem for localization. Modeling the SLAM system as a discrete time system with piece-wise linear SE〈3〉 motion, complete observability conditions are derived and a means to test the observability conditioning of candidate feature point groupings is proposed. Based on the conditioning, an efficient algorithm for picking the optimally observable feature subset is derived by incorporating the image geometric measures. The proposed monocular SLAM algorithm, called Optimally Observable and Minimal Cardinality (OOMC) SLAM is formulated as an EKF process. OOMC SLAM is first validated using a 6-DOF localization experiment; the results demonstrate accuracy comparable to the state-of-art SLAM algorithm with significantly improved computational efficiency. A longer sequence on a 620-meter trajectory is also tested. The algorithm achieves 0.9178% relative error against the GPS ground truth."
icra,None,Using vanishing points to improve visual-inertial odometry,"Federico Camposeco,Marc Pollefeys,","This work presents a method for increasing the accuracy of standard visual inertial odometry (VIO) by effectively removing the angular drift that naturally occurs in feature-based VIO. In order to eliminate such drift, we propose to leverage the predominance of parallel lines in man-made environments by using the intersection of their image projections, known as vanishing points (VPs). First, an efficient inertial-based method is presented that accurately and efficiently detects such points. Second, a strategy to deal with these measurements within the framework of an EKF-based VIO system is presented. Furthermore, special care is taken in order to ensure the real-time execution of the estimator in order to comply with time-critical applications running on computationally constrained platforms. Experiments are performed in a mobile device on challenging environments and evaluated against the same VIO system without the use of VPs, demonstrating the superior accuracy when employing the proposed framework."
icra,None,Dense mono reconstruction: Living with the pain of the plain plane,"Pedro Piniés,Lina Maria Paz,Paul Newman,","This paper is about dense depthmap estimation using a monocular camera in workspaces with extensive textureless surfaces. Current state of the art techniques have been shown to work in real time with an admirable performance in desktop-size environments. Unfortunately, as we show in this paper, when applied to larger indoor environments, performance often degrades. A common cause is the presence of large affine texture-less areas like by walls, floors, ceilings and drab objects such as chairs and tables. These produce noisy and worse still, grossly erroneous initial seeds for the depthmap that greatly impede successful optimisation. We solve this problem via the introduction of a new non-local higher-order regularisation term that enforces piecewise affine constraints between image pixels that are far apart in the image. This property leverages the observation that the depth at the edges of bland regions are often well estimated whereas their inner pixels are deeply problematic. A welcome by-product of our proposed technique is an estimate of the surface normals at each pixel. We will show that in terms of implementation, our algorithm is a natural extension of the often used variational approaches. We evaluate the proposed technique using real datasets for which we have ground truth models."
icra,None,Online self-supervised monocular visual odometry for ground vehicles,"Bhoram Lee,Kostas Daniilidis,Daniel D. Lee,","This paper presents an online self-supervised approach to monocular visual odometry and ground classification applied to ground vehicles. We solve the motion and structure problem based on a constrained kinematic model. The true scale of the monocular scene is recovered by estimating the ground surface. We consider a general parametric ground surface model and use the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for robust fitting of the parameters. The estimated ground surface provides training samples to learn a probabilistic appearance-based ground classifier in an online and self-supervised manner. The appearance-based classifier is then used to bias the RANSAC sampling to generate better hypotheses for parameter estimation of the ground surface model. Thus, without relying on any prior information, we combine geometric estimates with appearance-based classification to achieve an online self-learning scheme from monocular vision. Experimental results demonstrate that online learning improves the computational efficiency and accuracy compared to standard sampling in RANSAC. Evaluations on the KITTI benchmark dataset demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our overall methods in comparison to previous approaches."
icra,None,Scale-reconstructable Structure from Motion using refraction with a single camera,"Akira Shibata,Hiromitsu Fujii,Atsushi Yamashita,Hajime Asama,","Three-dimensional (3D) measurement is an important means for robots to acquire information about their environment. Structure from Motion is one of these 3D measurement methods. The 3D reconstruction of objects in the environment can be obtained from pictures captured with single camera in Structure from Motion. Furthermore, the camera motion can be obtained simultaneously. Because of its simplicity, Structure from Motion has been implemented in various ways. However there is an essential problem in that the scale of the measured objects cannot be computed by Structure from Motion. In order to compute the absolute scale, other information is required. However this is difficult for robots in an unknown situation. In this paper, we propose a method that can reconstruct the absolute scale of objects using refraction. Refraction changes the light ray path between the objects and the camera. This method is implemented using only a refractive plate and single camera. The results of simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method in both air and other media (e.g., water)."
icra,None,From dusk till dawn: Localisation at night using artificial light sources,"Peter Nelson,Winston Churchill,Ingmar Posner,Paul Newman,","This paper is about localising at night in urban environments using vision. Despite it being dark exactly half of the time, surprisingly little attention has been given to this problem. A defining aspect of night-time urban scenes is the presence and effect of artificial lighting - be that in the form of street or interior lighting through windows. By building a model of the environment which includes a representation of the spatial location of every light source, localisation becomes possible using monocular cameras. One of the challenges we face is the gross change in light appearance as a function of distance due to flare, saturation and bleeding - city lights certainly do not appear as point features. To overcome this, we model the appearance of each light as a function of vehicle location, using this to inform our data-association decisions and to regularise the cost function which is used to infer vehicle pose. In this way we develop a place-dependent but stable sensor model which is customised for the particular environment in which we are operating. We demonstrate that our system is able to localise successfully at night over 12 km in situations where a traditional point feature based system fails."
icra,None,Real-time onboard 6DoF localization of an indoor MAV in degraded visual environments using a RGB-D camera,"Zheng Fang,Sebastian Scherer,","Real-time and reliable localization is a prerequisite for autonomously performing high-level tasks with micro aerial vehicles(MAVs). Nowadays, most existing methods use vision system for 6DoF pose estimation, which can not work in degraded visual environments. This paper presents an onboard 6DoF pose estimation method for an indoor MAV in challenging GPS-denied degraded visual environments by using a RGB-D camera. In our system, depth images are mainly used for odometry estimation and localization. First, a fast and robust relative pose estimation (6DoF Odometry) method is proposed, which uses the range rate constraint equation and photometric error metric to get the frame-to-frame transform. Then, an absolute pose estimation (6DoF Localization) method is proposed to locate the MAV in a given 3D global map by using a particle filter. The whole localization system can run in real-time on an embedded computer with low CPU usage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in extensive real environments on a customized MAV platform. The experimental results show that our localization system can robustly and accurately locate the robot in various practical challenging environments."
icra,None,Localization on OpenStreetMap data using a 3D laser scanner,"Philipp Ruchti,Bastian Steder,Michael Ruhnke,Wolfram Burgard,","To determine the pose of a vehicle is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics. Most approaches relate the current sensor observations to a map generated with previously acquired data of the same system or by another system with a similar sensor setup. Unfortunately, previously acquired data is not always available. In outdoor settings, GPS is a very useful tool to determine a global estimate of the vehicles pose. Unfortunately, GPS tends to be unreliable in situations in which a clear view to the sky is restricted. Yet, one can make use of publicly available map material as prior information. In this paper, we describe an approach to localize a robot equipped with a 3D range scanner with respect to a road network created from OpenStreetMap data. To successfully localize a mobile robot we propose a road classification scheme for 3D range data together with a novel sensor model, which relates the classification results to a road network. Compared to other approaches, our system does not require the robot to actually travel on the road network. We evaluate our approach in extensive experiments on simulated and real data and compare favorably to two state-of-the-art methods on those data."
icra,None,Fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control strategy for rotor failure in an octorotor,"Majd Saied,Benjamin Lussier,Isabelle Fantoni,Clovis Francis,Hassan Shraim,,","This paper presents a fault tolerant approach for a coaxial octorotor regarding rotor failures. A complete architecture including error detection, fault isolation and system recovery is presented. The diagnosis system is designed with a nonlinear observer to generate residuals and an inference model to evaluate them and isolate the faulty motor. Once the motor failure is diagnosed, a recovery algorithm is applied. It uses the built-in hardware redundancy of the octorotor and compensates the loss of the failing motor by controlling its dual to keep a stable flight that allows the multirotor to continue its mission. This architecture is validated on real flights."
icra,None,Autonomous model-free landing control of small-scale flybarless helicopters,"Panos Marantos,George C. Karras,Charalampos P. Bechlioulis,Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos,","This paper proposes an autonomous landing scheme for a small-scale flybarless helicopter equipped with low-cost navigation sensors. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a model-free motion controller that guarantees autonomous landing with prescribed transient and steady state response, despite the presence of external disturbances acting on the vehicle. The proposed control scheme is of low complexity and does not require any knowledge of the helicopter dynamic parameters. Hence, it can be easily implemented in embedded control platforms integrated on small-scale helicopters. In order to provide the controller with accurate estimation of the vehicle's state vector during the landing procedure, an asynchronous sensor fusion and state estimation algorithm, based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), has been also implemented. The performance and the efficiency of the overall scheme are experimentally verified using a small-scale flybarless helicopter in a real autonomous landing process."
icra,None,Robust state estimation for Micro Aerial Vehicles based on system dynamics,"Michael Burri,Manuel Dätwiler,Markus W. Achtelik,Roland Siegwart,","In this work, we present a model-based estimation scheme for multi-rotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Although modeling approaches for MAVs have been presented in the past, these models have rarely been used for real-time state estimation onboard MAVs. Building on this work, we identify the most dominant effects and propose an easy-to-use calibration scheme for estimation of the model parameters. Given the calibration estimates for these parameters, we derive a state estimator where the state prediction of the indirect Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is driven by a MAV model. Solely using measurements from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a barometric pressure sensor - both available on almost every MAV - our model-based formulation keeps the estimated velocity of the MAV bounded in all directions, as opposed to state of the art IMU-model driven state estimators onboard MAVs. This is crucial for keeping MAVs airborne safely, for instance in the case of failures or re-initialization of vision based localization systems."
icra,None,Flight performance of a swashplateless micro air vehicle,"James Paulos,Mark Yim,","We present the control design, system integration, and free flight evaluation of a novel 227 g swashplateless coaxial helicopter. This micro aerial vehicle (MAV) achieves authority over roll, pitch, and yaw orientation as well as maneuvering thrust using only two propellers directly affixed to two motors. No additional aerodynamic control surfaces or actuators are introduced. Instead, cyclic control is obtained through the underactuated dynamic response of the main rotor itself to a modulated drive torque. Comparisons are drawn to conventional four-motor quadrotors and four-actuator fixed pitch coaxial helicopters in terms of mechanical complexity and actuator mass fraction. Trim power consumption in hover is reported across a range of symmetric and asymmetric loading states. Closed loop trajectory tracking maneuvers are demonstrated in a motion capture environment."
icra,None,Simultaneous estimation of aerodynamic and contact forces in flying robots: Applications to metric wind estimation and collision detection,"Teodor Tomić,Sami Haddadin,","In this paper, we extend our previous external wrench estimation scheme for flying robots with an aerodynamic model such that we are able to simultaneously estimate aerodynamic and contact forces online. This information can be used to identify the metric wind velocity vector via model inversion. Noticeably, we are still able to accurately sense collision forces at the same time. Discrimination between the two is achieved by identifying the natural contact frequency characteristics for both “interaction cases”. This information is then used to design suitable filters that are able to separate the aerodynamic from the collision forces for subsequent use. Now, the flying system is able to correctly respond to typical contact forces and does not accidentally “hallucinate” contacts due to a misinterpretation of wind disturbances. Overall, this paper generalizes our previous results towards significantly more complex environments."
icra,None,Integral action in first-order Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics. Application to aerial manipulators,"M. I. Sánchez,J. Á. Acosta,A. Ollero,","The aim of this work is to design, analyze and test the behaviour of first-order CLIK (Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics) manipulator algorithms under the influence of Cartesian integral error feedback. Although CLIK algorithms has been widely and successfully applied in robot manipulators with structured workspaces, in aerial manipulators the lack of structured workspaces is highly demanding for the control algorithm and some extra requirements are needed. Thus, in this work the standard proportional action in first-order CLIK algorithms is enhanced adding integral actions. Among others benefits, it provides a smoother behaviour needed for smart manipulation, zero steady-state tracking error, rejection to constant disturbances (like those of the numerical algorithm errors) and zero sensitivity to dc-gain uncertainties in stable systems. The theoretical achievement is corroborated with both simulations and experiments on a 7-DoF lightweight aerial manipulator. Experiments also include the integration with a SNS (Saturation in the Null Space) algorithm to deal with physical constraints, demonstrating a successful implementation and performance on a RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)."
icra,None,Tightly-coupled monocular visual-inertial fusion for autonomous flight of rotorcraft MAVs,"Shaojie Shen,Nathan Michael,Vijay Kumar,","There have been increasing interests in the robotics community in building smaller and more agile autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). In particular, the monocular visual-inertial system (VINS) that consists of only a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) forms a great minimum sensor suite due to its superior size, weight, and power (SWaP) characteristics. In this paper, we present a tightly-coupled nonlinear optimization-based monocular VINS estimator for autonomous rotorcraft MAVs. Our estimator allows the MAV to execute trajectories at 2 m/s with roll and pitch angles up to 30 degrees. We present extensive statistical analysis to verify the performance of our approach in different environments with varying flight speeds."

With underwater sensor networks that are capable of surfacing, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a solution to this by providing radio-based data muling services, but, as this area is still unexplored, the utility of this solution is unclear. In this paper, we examine the theoretical expectations, perform several field experiments, and analyze the communication success rates of 802.15.4 radios near the water surface both communicating between surface nodes as well as between a node and the UAV. These indicate that on the water surface internode radio communication is poor, but node to UAV communication can provide both reasonable ranges and success rates. We additionally measure and analyze the energy aspects of the systems, determining the impacts of parameters such as network size and distance between nodes on the UAV energy. Finally, we consolidate the information into an algorithm outlining how to configure and design hybrid UAV and underwater sensor network systems."

Göktoğan,Salah Sukkarieh,","Autonomous docking for airborne energy transfer is an important unmanned aerial vehicle capability that has yet to be accomplished. The implications of this technology are far reaching because vehicle endurance can be significantly extended without requiring additional onboard energy storage or environmental energy collection. A major barrier to docking with a drogue is reliable and accurate knowledge of the drogue's state, relative to the aircraft that is performing the manoeuvre. We address this by propagating a derived cable-drogue dynamic model using onboard sensor measurements, then correcting the state and aerodynamic coefficients with air-to-air visual observations. The approach is verified through a series of close formation flights with a marker based infra-red vision system. These flights represent significant progress toward an autonomous docking demonstration."

Duke Herrell,Nabil Simaan,","Transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) presents surgeons with challenges of limited tool dexterity. This paper investigates the limitations of dexterity and resection reach and accuracy within the intra-vesicular space of the bladder. The paper assumes the kinematics and geometry of current tools used for TURBT. The study presents a kinematic modeling framework and a simulation evaluation that aim to elucidate the limitations of current surgical tools. The kinematic framework also proposes a method for analyzing resection dexterity and accuracy in different regions of the bladder. The results demonstrate resection dexterity deficiencies in the areas neighboring the bladder neck and substantially higher dexterity in superior regions. In addition, the results of this work provide a currently missing quantified dexterity evaluation baseline for expected performance during manual TURBT against which future devices and robotic-assisted systems for resection can be compared."
icra,None,A cooperative control framework for haptic guidance of bimanual surgical tasks based on Learning From Demonstration,"Maura Power,Hedyeh Rafii-Tari,Christos Bergeles,Valentina Vitiello,,","Whilst current minimally invasive surgical robots offer many advantages to the surgeon, most of them are still controlled using the traditional master-slave approach, without fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both the human user and the robot. This paper proposes a framework that provides a cooperative control approach to human-robot interaction. Typical teleoperation is enhanced by incorporating haptic guidance-based feedback for surgical tasks, which are demonstrated to and learned by the robot. Safety in the surgical scene is maintained during reproduction of the learned tasks by including the surgeon in the guided execution of the learned task at all times. Continuous Hidden Markov Models are used for task learning, real-time learned task recognition and generating setpoint trajectories for haptic guidance. Two different surgical training tasks were demonstrated and encoded by the system, and the framework was evaluated using the Raven II surgical robot research platform. The results indicate an improvement in user task performance with the haptic guidance in comparison to unguided teleoperation."

Accurate delivery of the interventional devices and avoiding the radiation are especially important for the surgeons. This paper presents a novel dedicated dual-finger robotic hand (DRH) and a console to assist the surgeons to deliver the interventional devices in PCIs. The system is designed in the master-slave way which helps the surgeons to reduce the exposure to radiation. The mechanism of the DRH is bio-inspired and motions are decoupled in kinematics. In PCI procedures, the accuracy of the guidewire delivery and the catheter tip placement have significant effects on the surgical results. The performances of the DRH in delivering the guidewire and the balloon/stent catheter were evaluated by three surgical manipulations. The results show that the DRH has the ability to deliver the guidewire and the balloon/stent catheter precisely."

Patel,","In this paper, based on the apparent stiffness analysis of a dual tendon-sheath system, we propose a method for using a surgical instrument of the da Vinci surgical robotic system (from Intuitive Surgical Inc.) for estimation of mechanical properties of tissues. The performance of the method is experimentally evaluated by comparing tissues with different stiffnesses and by localizing tumors in an artificial tissue sample."
icra,None,Multi-modal localization algorithm for catheter interventions,"Justin A. Borgstadt,Michael R. Zinn,Nicola J. Ferrier,","Localization of steerable catheters in minimally invasive surgery is critical with respect to patient safety, surgeon manipulation, and procedural efficacy. While there are many potential benefits to patients including shorter recovery times, less tissue trauma, and lower infection rates than traditional surgeries, localization of surgical tools is still an area of much research. Current technology offers several sensory modalities. However, each system has drawbacks which do not provide a clear best practice. This research focuses on incorporating redundant commonplace surgical sensing technologies to reduce the likelihood of errors, failures, or inherent sensor characteristics causing harm to the patient and/or surgeon while providing accurate localization. Dual particle filters are implemented using both a fluoroscopic-like stereo imaging system and an electromagnetic pose sensor for measurement updates in a prototype catheter testbed. A previously developed catheter model is modified to increase accuracy in the particle filter outputs which are combined using a weighted average based on each filter's particle statistics. Experimental results implementing the combined particle filter multi-modality algorithm in feedback control validates the algorithms ability to provide accurate localization in a surgical setting while overcoming sensor limitations and possible failure modes."
icra,None,ViMbot: Design and control of a new magnet robot actuated by an external vibrating magnetic field,"Jaeyeon Lee,Young Sub Lee,Wooram Park,","This paper presents a design, a control scheme, and experiments for a new vibrating magnet robot (ViMbot). Permanent magnets in the new robot vibrate due to an external vibrating magnetic field. The vibration motion of the robot induces the locomotion of the robot. The vibratory dynamic response of the ViMbot is heavily dependent on the frequency of the vibration. This paper shows that the direction of the robot locomotion can be controlled by the vibration frequency of the external magnetic field. To achieve the distinct dynamic responses depending on the vibration frequency, three acrylic plates with different torsional stiffness are attached at three sides of the triangle-shaped ViMbot and then a magnet is attached to each plate. A strategy to find the special frequencies inducing locomotion and associated experiments with the ViMbot are presented. Control experiments for the ViMbot using the special frequencies are also presented. Because the proposed robot is actuated by an external energy source, the robot can move without traditional actuation components such as motors with batteries. This new design concept allows us to miniaturize the proposed robot."
icra,None,Effects of master-slave tool misalignment in a teleoperated surgical robot,"Lawrence H. Kim,Clifford Bargar,Yuhang Che,Allison M. Okamura,","In a teleoperated system, misalignment between the master and slave manipulators can result from clutching, errors in the kinematic model, and/or sensor errors. This study examines the effects of type and magnitude of misalignment on the performance of the teleoperator. We first characterized the magnitude and direction of orientation misalignment created when clutching and unclutching during use of two surgical robots: the Raven II and the da Vinci Research Kit. We then purposely generated typical misalignments in order to measure the impact of such misalignment on user performance of a peg transfer task with the Raven II. Users were able to compensate for misalignment angles up to approximately 20 degrees in both tool orientation and camera viewpoint misalignment. These results can be used to guide the design and control of teleoperated systems for a variety of applications."
icra,None,Teleoperated versus open needle driving: Kinematic analysis of experienced surgeons and novice users,"Ilana Nisky,Yuhang Che,Zhan Fan Quek,Matthew Weber,Michael H. Hsieh,,","During robotic teleoperation, the dynamics of the master manipulators and the control of remote-side instruments impose challenges on the motor system of the human operator, and may impact performance and learning. In teleoperated robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, there is a clear correlation between patient outcomes and the surgeon's case experience. However, the effect of the teleoperator on human motor skills and the relationship between these motor skills and patient outcomes are unknown. We used the da Vinci Research Kit, a custom research version of the da Vinci Surgical System, to compare teleoperated and open needle-driving movements of experienced da Vinci surgeons and novices. The experimental protocol consisted of structured but unconstrained needle driving trials repeated 80 times to allow for computational modeling of movement coordination and learning. Kinematic analysis showed that teleoperation increases trial time but reduces path length, that the trial times and path lengths of experienced surgeons are smaller than those of novices. In addition, there are significant differences in learning between experienced surgeons and novice users. Modeling of the movements and learning processes of experienced and novice surgeons may be used in the design of novel controllers that will expand robotic surgery capabilities and improve robot-assisted surgical skill acquisition."
icra,None,"Tendons, concentric tubes, and a bevel tip: Three steerable robots in one transoral lung access system","Philip J. Swaney,Arthur W. Mahoney,Andria A. Remirez,Erik Lamers,,,,,","Lung cancer is the most deadly form of cancer, and survival depends on early-stage diagnosis and treatment. Transoral access is preferable to traditional between-the-ribs needle insertion because it is less invasive and reduces risk of lung collapse. Yet many sites in the peripheral zones of the lung or distant from the bronchi cannot currently be accessed transorally, due to the relatively large diameter and lack of sufficient steerablity of current instrumentation. To remedy this, we propose a new robotic system that uses a tendon-actuated device (bronchoscope) as a first stage for deploying a concentric tube robot, which itself is a vehicle through which a bevel steered needle can be introduced into the soft tissue of the lung outside the bronchi. In this paper we present the various components of the system and the workflow we envision for deploying the robot to a target using image guidance. We describe initial validation experiments in which we puncture ex vivo bronchial wall tissue and also target a nodule in a phantom with an average final tip error of 0.72 mm."
icra,None,Particle computation: Device fan-out and binary memory,"Hamed Mohtasham Shad,Rose Morris-Wright,Erik D. Demaine,Sándor P. Fekete,,","We present fundamental progress on the computational universality of swarms of micro- or nano-scale robots in complex environments, controlled not by individual navigation, but by a uniform global, external force. Consider a 2D grid world, in which all obstacles and robots are unit squares, and for each actuation, robots move maximally until they collide with an obstacle or another robot. In previous work, we demonstrated components of particle computation in this world, designing obstacle configurations that implement AND and OR logic gates: by using dual-rail logic, we designed NOT, NOR, NAND, XOR, XNOR logic gates. However, we were unable to design a FAN-OUT gate, which is necessary for simulating the full range of complex interactions that are present in arbitrary digital circuits. In this work we resolve this problem by proving unit-sized robots cannot generate a FAN-OUT gate. On the positive side, we resolve the missing component with the help of 2×1 robots, which can create fan-out gates that produce multiple copies of the inputs. Using these gates we are able to establish the full range of computational universality as presented by complex digital circuits. As an example we connect our logic elements to produce a 3-bit counter. We also demonstrate how to implement a data storage element."
icra,None,Symmetries and reduction for multi-agent control,"Ashley Nettleman,Bill Goodwine,","This paper computes all the continuous point-transformation symmetries for a planar multi-agent dynamical control system. The relative configuration among the agents is often the most important aspect of this problem, and this paper presents a method to “factor out” the location and orientation on the plane of a multi-agent formation problem. This is useful in the case where only the relative positioning of the agents is of concern. The method to compute the symmetries and determine the reduced coordinates is well-established. The contributions of this paper are (1) computing the symmetries for a multi-agent system, (2) highlighting the utility of the reduction for the formation control application such as formation stability and (3) analyzing the symmetries to determine a relatively broad class of systems which have the same symmetries and hence identical coordinates for reduction. Although it has been addressed in various ways, essentially all methods to determine the stability properties of the formation control problem need the dynamics to be formulated on a reduced, relative space. Hence, stability (and stability-like notions such as that which follow from LaSalle's Principle) analyses will be the main beneficiary of this work."
icra,None,Multi-robot task planning and sequencing using the SAT-TSP language,"Frank Imeson,Stephen L. Smith,","The Sat-Tsp language was recently proposed [1] for expressing and solving high-level robotic path planning problems. In this paper we show how different constraints that commonly appear in path planning problems, such as set constraints, counting constraints, and ordering constraints can all be expressed in the Sat-Tsp language. We also show how the language can be used to express multi-robot path planning problems. We evaluate our existing solver approaches on test problems that include a variety of complex constraints and we demonstrate the language through a ROS implementation. We also provide a new approach that reduces the Sat-Tsp language to the generalized traveling salesman problem language. We show that this new approach outperforms our existing approaches on problems that contain one-on-a-set constraints."
icra,None,Planning for multi-agent teams with leader switching,"Siddharth Swaminathan,Mike Phillips,Maxim Likhachev,","Follow-the-leader based approaches have been popular for the control of multi-robot teams for their ability to drive many with few. Typically, in these methods you select a single leader, generate a plan for it, while all other agents follow this leader using their individual controllers. However, there are many scenarios where this approach can lead to highly suboptimal behavior or even failure in the presence of clutter. In this work, we present a planning approach that automatically figures out when to switch leaders on the way to the goal while minimizing a given cost function that penalizes leader switching and deviations from the desired formation. To deal with the increased dimensionality of the problem we show how a recently developed algorithm, MHA* (multi-heuristic A*) can be extended to support planning for a team of robots. We also provide explicit cost minimization and guarantee that paths found are within a user- chosen factor of optimality with respect to the graph modeling the planning problem. Experimentally, we found that allowing for dynamic leader-switching leads to a significant increase in finding feasible plans for multi-robot teams ranging up to 21 robots."
icra,None,Fair Multi-Target Tracking in Cooperative Multi-Robot systems,"Jacopo Banfi,Jérôme Guzzi,Alessandro Giusti,Luca Gambardella,,",Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMOMMT) denotes a class of problems in which a set of autonomous mobile robots equipped with limited-range sensors are used to keep under observation a (possibly larger) set of mobile targets. Robots cooperatively plan their motion in order to maximize the time during which each target lies within the sensing range of at least one robot.
icra,None,An efficient cooperative deployment of robots for multiple tasks,"H. S. Lee,J. D. Jeon,B. H. Lee,","In this paper, we introduce an efficient technique that addresses the deployment problem of a team of heterogeneous robots. For multiple scattered tasks in arbitrary space, the objective to be solved is to minimize time for robots to reach all the task locations. In order to reach the assigned task locations efficiently, the team composed of one carrier robot and several servant robots with different motion capabilities is considered. The carrier robot is responsible for transporting and deployment of the servant robots. The servant robot, deployed by the carrier robot, moves to the assigned task location and executes the given task. Then, the overall time to reach all the task locations is determined by considering the path of the carrier that is made by deployment points, and by the maximum time traveled by the servant robots. To find efficient deployment points, the set of all the tasks are iteratively divided into two subsets. Then, an optimal deployment point corresponding to two subsets is calculated by considering the speed of the carrier robot and servant robot, the unloading time for deployment, and few dynamics of the carrier robot. The overall time is computed and compared to the previous result so that the time it takes is continuously reduced. The proposed method has been tested on simulations."
icra,None,Biomimetic algorithms for coordinated motion: Theory and implementation,"Udit Halder,Biswadip Dey,","Drawing inspiration from flight behavior in biological settings (e.g. territorial battles in dragonflies, and flocking in starlings), this paper demonstrates two strategies for coverage and flocking. Using earlier theoretical studies on mutual motion camouflage, an appropriate steering control law for area coverage has been implemented in a laboratory test-bed equipped with wheeled mobile robots and a Vicon high speed motion capture system. The same test-bed is also used to demonstrate another strategy (based on local information), termed topological velocity alignment, which serves to make agents move in the same direction. The present work illustrates the applicability of biological inspiration in the design of multi-agent robotic collectives."
icra,None,A general technique for fast comprehensive multi-root planning on graphs by coloring vertices and deferring edges,"Christopher M. Dellin,Siddhartha S. Srinivasa,","We formulate and study the comprehensive multi-root (CMR) planning problem, in which feasible paths are desired between multiple regions. We propose two primary contributions which allow us to extend state-of-the-art sampling-based planners. First, we propose the notion of vertex coloring as a compact representation of the CMR objective on graphs. Second, we propose a method for deferring edge evaluations which do not advance our objective, by way of a simple criterion over these vertex colorings. The resulting approach can be applied to any CMR-agnostic graph-based planner which evaluates a sequence of edges. We prove that the theoretical performance of the colored algorithm is always strictly better than (or equal to) that of the corresponding uncolored version. We then apply the approach to the Probabalistic RoadMap (PRM) algorithm; the resulting Colored Probabalistic RoadMap (cPRM) is illustrated on 2D and 7D CMR problems."
icra,None,IBuILD: Incremental bag of Binary words for appearance based loop closure detection,"Sheraz Khan,Dirk Wollherr,","In robotics applications such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), loop closure detection is an integral component required to build a consistent topological or metric map. This paper presents an appearance based loop closure detection mechanism titled `IBuILD' (Incremental bag of BInary words for Appearance based Loop closure Detection). The presented approach focuses on an online, incremental formulation of binary vocabulary generation for loop closure detection. The proposed approach does not require a prior vocabulary learning phase and relies purely on the appearance of the scene for loop closure detection without the need of odometry or GPS estimates. The vocabulary generation process is based on feature tracking between consecutive images to incorporate pose invariance. In addition, this process is coupled with a simple likelihood function to generate the most suitable loop closure candidate and a temporal consistency constraint to filter out inconsistent loop closures. Evaluation on different publicly available outdoor urban and indoor datasets shows that the presented approach is capable of generating higher recall at 100% precision in comparison to the state of the art."
icra,None,Visual chunking: A list prediction framework for region-based object detection,"Nicholas Rhinehart,Jiaji Zhou,Martial Hebert,J. Andrew Bagnell,","We consider detecting objects in an image by iteratively selecting from a set of arbitrarily shaped candidate regions. Our generic approach, which we term visual chunking, reasons about the locations of multiple object instances in an image while expressively describing object boundaries. We design an optimization criterion for measuring the performance of a list of such detections as a natural extension to a common per-instance metric. We present an efficient algorithm with provable performance for building a high-quality list of detections from any candidate set of region-based proposals. We also develop a simple class-specific algorithm to generate a candidate region instance in near-linear time in the number of low-level superpixels that outperforms other region generating methods. In order to make predictions on novel images at testing time without access to ground truth, we develop learning approaches to emulate these algorithms' behaviors. We demonstrate that our new approach outperforms sophisticated baselines on benchmark datasets."
icra,None,Leveraging image-based prior in cross-season place recognition,"Ando Masatoshi,Chokushi Yuuto,Tanaka Kanji,Yanagihara Kentaro,","In this paper, we address the challenging problem of single-view cross-season place recognition. A new approach is proposed for compact discriminative scene descriptor that helps in coping with changes in appearance in the environment. We focus on a simple effective strategy that uses objects whose appearance remain the same across seasons as valid landmarks. Unlike popular bag-of-words (BoW) scene descriptors that rely on a library of vector quantized visual features, our descriptor is based on a library of raw image data (e.g., visual experience shared by colleague robots, publicly available photo collections from Google StreetView), and directly mines it to identify landmarks (i.e., image patches) that effectively explain an input query/database image. The discovered landmarks are then compactly described by their pose and shape (i.e., library image ID, and bounding boxes) and used as a compact discriminative scene descriptor for the input image. We collected a dataset of single-view images across seasons with annotated ground truth, and evaluated the effectiveness of our scene description framework by comparing its performance to that of previous BoW approaches, and by applying an advanced Naive Bayes Nearest neighbor (NBNN) image-to-class distance measure."
icra,None,Long-term topological place learning,"Özgür Erkent,H. Işıl Bozma,","In this work, we consider long-term topological place learning and present an approach that enables the robot to learn in an unsupervised, organized and incremental manner. The knowledge associated with the previously visited places is internally stored in the form of bubble descriptor semantic tree (BDST) using the previously proposed bubble space representation. The BDST is generated and maintained without any external supervision. It organizes the learned knowledge where the terminal nodes are viewed as corresponding to distinct places while its structure encodes their semantic hierarchy. In case the robot is not able to recognize a place with its current BDST, it learns it via updating the BDST incrementally based on the hierarchical single link clustering algorithm SLINK. The proposed approach is evaluated experimentally using combined benchmark datasets from indoor and outdoor settings with recognition rates comparable to those of state-of-the-art approaches while the robot is able to retain efficiently and use the knowledge associated with the learned places."
icra,None,What should I landmark? Entropy of normals in depth juts for place recognition in changing environments using RGB-D data,"Daniel Gutiérrez-Gómez,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas,J.J. Guerrero,","One open problem in the fields of place recognition and mapping is to be able to recognise a revisited place when its appearance and layout have changed between visits. In this paper, we investigate this problem in the context of RGB-D mapping in indoor environments. We propose to segment the scene in juts (neighbourhood of 3D points with normals that stick out from the surroundings) and look at low-level features, like textureness or entropy of the normals. These could differentiate those zones of the scene that change or move along time from those that are likely to remain static. We also present a method which improves the matching between images of the same place taken at different times by pruning details basing on these features. We evaluate on a number of communal areas and also on some scenes captured 6 months apart. Experiments with our approach, show an increase up to 70% in inlier matching ratio at the cost of pruning only less than 20% of correct matches, without the need of performing geometric verification."
icra,None,Location graphs for visual place recognition,"Elena Stumm,Christopher Mei,Simon Lacroix,Margarita Chli,","With the growing demand for deployment of robots in real scenarios, robustness in the perception capabilities for navigation lies at the forefront of research interest, as this forms the backbone of robotic autonomy. Existing place recognition approaches traditionally follow the feature-based bag-of-words paradigm in order to cut down on the richness of information in images. As structural information is typically ignored, such methods suffer from perceptual aliasing and reduced recall, due to the ambiguity of observations. In a bid to boost the robustness of appearance-based place recognition, we consider the world as a continuous constellation of visual words, while keeping track of their covisibility in a graph structure. Locations are queried based on their appearance, and modelled by their corresponding cluster of landmarks from the global covisibility graph, which retains important relational information about landmarks. Complexity is reduced by comparing locations by their graphs of visual words in a simplified manner. Test results show increased recall performance and robustness to noisy observations, compared to state-of-the-art methods."
icra,None,Keypoint matching by outlier pruning with consensus constraint,"Yang Liu,Rong Feng,Hong Zhang,","A simple and reliable keypoint matching method is proposed in this paper. Our research is motivated by the desire to improve the performance of multi-view geometry (MVG) based verification in visual loop closure detection under significant illumination change, where traditional methods may fail due to their inability to either find a sufficient number of correctly matched keypoints or identify correct underlying camera motion to verify the matches. Our method is inspired by research on the spatial statistics of optical flow. By observing that the displacement of matching keypoints between a pair of images is equivalent to the optical flow under the assumption of small camera motion (which is true in applications such as loop closure detection), we exploit the fact that the displacement of correctly matched keypoints between two images must follow a well-defined distribution. This paves the way to a keypoint matching method that uses this distribution to screen or prune potential matching keypoints, so as to remove the incorrect matches (outliers) and retain the true matches (inliers) without being overly and solely dependent on keypoint descriptors. The proposed method is validated on the outdoor image sequences and shows superior performance to the standard keypoint matching method based on distance ratio test."
icra,None,Environment selection and hierarchical place recognition,"Mahesh Mohan,Dorian Gálvez-López,Claire Monteleoni,Gabe Sibley,","As robots continue to create long-term maps, the amount of information that they need to handle increases over time. In terms of place recognition, this implies that the number of images being considered may increase until exceeding the computational resources of the robot. In this paper we consider a scenario where, given multiple independent large maps, possibly from different cities or locations, a robot must effectively and in real time decide whether it can localize itself in one of those known maps. Since the number of images to be handled by such a system is likely to be extremely large, we find that it is beneficial to decompose the set of images into independent groups or environments. This raises a new question: Given a query image, how do we select the best environment? This paper proposes a similarity criterion that can be used to solve this problem. It is based on the observation that, if each environment is described in terms of its co-occurrent features, similarity between environments can be established by comparing their co-occurrence matrices. We show that this leads to a novel place recognition algorithm that divides the collection of images into environments and arranges them in a hierarchy of inverted indices. By selecting first the relevant environment for the operating robot, we can reduce the number of images to perform the actual loop detection, reducing the execution time while preserving the accuracy. The practicality of this approach is shown through experimental results on several large datasets covering a combined distance of more than 750Km."
icra,None,Local motion planning for collaborative multi-robot manipulation of deformable objects,"Javier Alonso-Mora,Ross Knepper,Roland Siegwart,Daniela Rus,","This paper presents a formalism that exploits deformability during manipulation of soft objects by robot teams. A hybrid centralized/distributed approach restricts centralized planning to high-level global guidance of the object for consensus. Low-level control is thus delegated to the individual manipulator robots, which retain manipulation and collision avoidance guarantees by passing forces to one another through the object. A distributed receding horizon planner provides local control, formulated as a convex optimization problem in velocity space and incorporating constraints for both collision avoidance and shape maintenance. We demonstrate teams of mobile manipulators autonomously carrying various deformable objects."
icra,None,Operating an unknown drawer using an aerial manipulator,"Suseong Kim,Hoseong Seo,H. Jin Kim,","This paper is about opening and closing an unknown drawer using an aerial manipulator. To accommodate practical applications, it is assumed that the direction of motion and mechanical properties of the drawer are not given beforehand. A multirotor combined with a robotic arm is used for the manipulation task. Typical drawers are allowed to move in only one direction, which constrains the motion of the aerial manipulator while operating a drawer. To analyze this interaction, the dynamic characteristics of the aerial manipulator are modeled. Also, configuration of the aerial manipulator for exerting the desired force to a drawer is presented. To handle the uncertainties associated with the mechanism of a drawer, strategies exploiting velocity of the end effector are employed. The proposed approach is validated with experiments including opening and closing a common drawer, which is detected by a camera mounted in the palm of the end effector."
icra,None,Supervised Remote Robot with Guided Autonomy and Teleoperation (SURROGATE): A framework for whole-body manipulation,"Paul Hebert,Jeremy Ma,James Borders,Alper Aydemir,Max Bajracharya,,,,,,","The use of the cognitive capabilties of humans to help guide the autonomy of robotics platforms in what is typically called “supervised-autonomy” is becoming more commonplace in robotics research. The work discussed in this paper presents an approach to a human-in-the-loop mode of robot operation that integrates high level human cognition and commanding with the intelligence and processing power of autonomous systems. Our framework for a “Supervised Remote Robot with Guided Autonomy and Teleoperation” (SURROGATE) is demonstrated on a robotic platform consisting of a pan-tilt perception head, two 7-DOF arms connected by a single 7-DOF torso, mounted on a tracked-wheel base. We present an architecture that allows high-level supervisory commands and intents to be specified by a user that are then interpreted by the robotic system to perform whole body manipulation tasks autonomously. We use a concept of “behaviors” to chain together sequences of “actions” for the robot to perform which is then executed real time."
icra,None,Decentralized parameter estimation and observation for cooperative mobile manipulation of an unknown load using noisy measurements,"Antonio Franchi,Antonio Petitti,Alessandro Rizzo,","In this paper, a distributed approach for the estimation of kinematic and inertial parameters of an unknown rigid body is presented. The body is manipulated by a pool of ground mobile manipulators. Each robot retrieves a noisy measurement of its velocity and the contact forces applied to the body. Kinematics and dynamics arguments are used to distributively estimate the relative positions of the contact points. Subsequently, distributed estimation filters and nonlinear observers are used to estimate the body mass, the relative position between its geometric center and its center of mass, and its moment of inertia. The manipulation strategy is functional to the estimation process, and is suitably designed to satisfy nonlinear observability conditions that are necessary for the success of the estimation. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings."
icra,None,A web-based infrastructure for recording user demonstrations of mobile manipulation tasks,"Ellis Ratner,Benjamin Cohen,Mike Phillips,Maxim Likhachev,","Learning from demonstration (LfD) is a common technique applied to many problems in robotics, such as populating grasp databases, training for reinforcement learning of high-level skill sets and bootstrapping motion planners. While such approaches are generally highly valued, they rely on the often time-consuming process of gathering user demonstrations, and hence it becomes difficult to attain a sizeable dataset. In this paper, we present a tool capable of recording large numbers of high-dimensional demonstrations of mobile manipulation tasks provided by non-experts in the field. Our tool accomplishes this via a web interface that requires no additional software to be installed beyond a web browser, as well as a scalable architecture that is capable of supporting 10 concurrent demonstrators on a single server. Our architecture employs a lightweight simulation environment to reduce unnecessary computations and improve performance. Furthermore, we show how our tool can be used to gather a large set of demonstrations of a mobile manipulation task by leveraging existing crowdsource platforms. The data set collected has been made available to the robotics community. We also present experiments in which we apply demonstrations collected through our infrastructure to teach a robot how to grasp, to teach a robot how to perform dexterous manipulation tasks such as scooping and to accelerate motion planning for full-body manipulation tasks."
icra,None,Learning non-holonomic object models for mobile manipulation,"Jonathan Scholz,Martin Levihn,Charles L. Isbell,Henrik Christensen,,","For a mobile manipulator to interact with large everyday objects, such as office tables, it is often important to have dynamic models of these objects. However, as it is infeasible to provide the robot with models for every possible object it may encounter, it is desirable that the robot can identify common object models autonomously. Existing methods for addressing this challenge are limited by being either purely kinematic, or inefficient due to a lack of physical structure. In this paper, we present a physics-based method for estimating the dynamics of common non-holonomic objects using a mobile manipulator, and demonstrate its efficiency compared to existing approaches."
icra,None,RoboFlow: A flow-based visual programming language for mobile manipulation tasks,"Sonya Alexandrova,Zachary Tatlock,Maya Cakmak,","General-purpose robots can perform a range of useful tasks in human environments; however, programming them to robustly function in all possible environments that they might encounter is unfeasible. Instead, our research aims to develop robots that can be programmed by its end-users in their context of use, so that the robot needs to robustly function in only one particular environment. This requires intuitive ways in which end-users can program their robot. To that end, this paper contributes a flow-based visual programming language, called RoboFlow, that allows programming of generalizable mobile manipulation tasks. RoboFlow is designed to (i) ensure a robust low-level implementation of program procedures on a mobile manipulator, and (ii) restrict the high-level programming as much as possible to avoid user errors while enabling expressive programs that involve branching, looping, and nesting. We present an implementation of RoboFlow on a PR2 mobile manipulator and demonstrate the generalizability and error handling properties of RoboFlow programs on everyday mobile manipulation tasks in human environments."
icra,None,Wireless map-based handoffs for mobile robots,"Richard Wang,Matthew K. Mukerjee,Manuela Veloso,Srinivasan Seshan,","Most wireless solutions today are centered around people-centric devices like laptops and cell phones that are insufficient for mobile robots. The key difference is that people-centric devices use wireless connectivity in bursts under primarily stationary settings while mobile robots continuously transmit data even while moving. When mobile robots use existing wireless solutions, it results in intolerable and seemingly random interruptions in wireless connectivity when moving [1]. These wireless issues stem from suboptimal switching across wireless infrastructure access points (APs), also called AP handoffs. These poor handoff decisions are due to stateless handoff algorithms that make wireless decisions solely from immediate and noisy scans of surrounding wireless conditions. In this paper, we propose to overcome these motion-based wireless connectivity issues for autonomous robots using highly informed handoff algorithms that combine fine-grain wireless maps with accurate robot localization. Our results show significant wireless performance improvements for continuously moving robots in real environments without any modifications to the wireless infrastructure."
icra,None,Towards balance recovery control for lower body exoskeleton robots with Variable Stiffness Actuators: Spring-loaded flywheel model,"Corinne Doppmann,Barkan Ugurlu,Masashi Hamaya,Tatsuya Teramae,,,","This paper presents a biologically-inspired real-time balance recovery control strategy that is applied to a lower body exoskeleton with variable physical stiffness actuators at its ankle joints. For this purpose, a torsional spring-loaded flywheel model is presented to encapsulate both approximated angular momentum and variable physical stiffness, which are crucial parameters in describing the postural balance. In particular, the incorporation of physical compliance enables us to provide three main contributions: i) A mathematical formulation is developed to express the relation between the dynamic balance criterion ZMP and the physical ankle joint stiffness. Therefore, balancing control can be interpreted in terms of ankle joint stiffness regulation. ii) ‘Variable physical’ stiffness is utilized in the bipedal robot balance control task for the first time in the literature, to the authors' knowledge. iii) The variable physical stiffness strategy is compared with the optimal constant stiffness strategy by conducting experiments on our exoskeleton robot. The results indicate that the proposed method provides a favorable balancing control performance to cope with unperceived perturbations, in terms of center of mass position regulation, ZMP error and mechanical power."
icra,None,Effects of exoskeletal stiffness in parallel with the knee on the motion of the human body center of mass during walking,"Kamran Shamaei,Massimo Cenciarini,Albert A. Adams,Karen N. Gregorczyk,,,","In this paper we investigate effects of the mass, kinematic constraints imposed by the joint, and assistance provided by the spring of a pair of quasi-passive knee exoskeletons on the motion of the human body center of mass during normal walking. The exoskeletons implement a spring in parallel with the knee joint in the weight acceptance phase of gait, and allow free rotation during all other phases. We begin with a brief explanation of the exoskeleton design, which employs a friction-based latching mechanism to engage/disengage a spring in parallel with the knee. Additionally, a pair of joint-less mass replicas of the exoskeletons were used to separately investigate the effects of the exoskeleton added mass and articulation. It was found that the exoskeleton mass is the main contributor to the changes in the motion of the center of mass, with more pronounced fluctuations of the center of mass in the mediolateral direction, while the exoskeleton joint and spring had negligible effects over and above those of the mass. Additionally, the exoskeleton mass and assistance conditions respectively resulted in a non-significant increase and a non-significant decrease in the total mechanical work of the body."
icra,None,A new adaptive frequency oscillator for gait assistance,"Keehong Seo,SeungYong Hyung,Byung Kwon Choi,Younbaek Lee,,","To control exoskeletons for walking gait assistance, it is of primary importance to control them to act synchronously with the gaits of users. To effectively estimate the gait cycle (or the phase within a stride) of users, we propose a new adaptive frequency oscillator (AFO). While previous AFOs successfully estimated the walking frequency from joint angles as inputs, the new AFO, called particularly-shaped adaptive oscillator (PSAO) can estimate gait cycle from the same inputs, which would have required foot contact sensors in previous approaches. To predict the effects of PSAO-based gait assistance on human walking, it has been tested with neuromuscular walking simulation. In the simulation, the gait assistance system reduced the metabolic cost of walking for some assistance patterns. The walk ratio (step length per step rate) also changed as assistance patterns shifted in phase, which is meaningful because metabolic cost of walking in general is minimal at specific walk ratio. For a prototype exoskeleton we developed, the effect of gait assistance was experimented on a human subject walking on level ground and inclining slopes to verify the predictions from the simulation: (1) physiological cost index computed from heart rate significantly decreased indicating reduction in metabolic energy expenditure; (2) walk ratio was in fact controllable to an extent."
icra,None,Design analysis of a passive weight-support lower-extremity-exoskeleton with compliant knee-joint,"Kok-Meng Lee,Donghai Wang,","This paper presents the design concept of a weight-support lower-extremity-exoskeleton (LEE) with a compliant joint to relieve compressive load in the knee. Along with a leg dynamic model and a knee bio-joint model, a compliant exoskeleton knee-joint has been designed using topology optimization and experimentally evaluated. Results suggest that the gait-based design of a LEE can be divided into two parts in terms of knee angles; compliant coupling and body-weight support. The concept feasibility and dynamic models of the passive LEE design have been experimentally validated with measured plantar forces. Both simulation and experimental results agree with data in-vivo confirming the effectiveness of the LEE in supporting human body-weight during walking, and also provide a basis for computing the internal knee forces as a percentage of bodyweight."
icra,None,Design of a cable-driven active leg exoskeleton (C-ALEX) and gait training experiments with human subjects,"Xin Jin,Xiang Cui,Sunil K. Agrawal,","Robotic rehabilitation devices are attractive to physical therapists. Various leg exoskeletons have been developed during the past decade and have been used in gait training. Traditional exoskeletons usually have a complex structure and add extra inertia to the wearer's leg, which may change their natural gait. In this paper, we present the design of a cable-driven active leg exoskeleton (C-ALEX) for human gait training. The advantages of cable-driven designs are that they have a simpler structure, add minimal inertia to the human limbs, and do not require precise joint alignment. C-ALEX employs the “assist-as-needed” control strategy to help the ankle center move along a prescribed path. An experiment with 6 healthy subjects was conducted who walked with C-ALEX on a treadmill. The results showed that C-ALEX is capable of helping the subjects better track a prescribed ankle path."
icra,None,Experimental comparison of torque control methods on an ankle exoskeleton during human walking,"Juanjuan Zhang,Chien Chern Cheah,Steven H. Collins,","Few comparisons have been performed across torque controllers for exoskeletons, and differences among devices have made interpretation difficult. In this study, we designed, developed and compared the torque-tracking performance of nine control methods, including variations on classical feedback control, model-based control, adaptive control and iterative learning. Each was tested with four high-level controllers that determined desired torque based on time, joint angle, a neuromuscular model, or electromyography. Controllers were implemented on a tethered ankle exoskeleton with series elastic actuation. Measurements were taken while one human subject walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m·s -1 for one hundred steady-state steps. The combination of proportional control with damping injection and iterative learning resulted in the lowest errors for all high-level controllers. With time-based desired torque, root-mean-squared errors were 0.6 N·m (1.3% of peak desired torque) step by step, and 0.1 N·m (0.2%) on average. These results indicate that model-free, integration-free feedback control is suited to the uncertain dynamics of the human-robot system, while iterative learning is effective in the cyclic task of walking."

Human sensorimotor system is specialized with position and velocity sensory fibers and exhibits variant muscle impedance in accordance with the ongoing task. The virtually interfaced robotic ankle and balance trainer (vi-RABT) was introduced as a cost-effective platform-based rehabilitation robot to improve overall ankle / balance strength, mobility and control. This study is the first step toward assistive / resistive ankle rehabilitation using vi-RABT. We have implemented a task-dependent anisotropic impedance controller into the 2-DOF ankle rehabilitation robot. An objective virtual Maze game is developed. The controller is specifically designed for the Maze workspace; and exhibits elastic or pure viscos properties in compliant with the subject's direction of movement. Early results on two human subjects are presented."
icra,None,Design and control of a wearable hand exoskeleton with force-controllable and compact actuator modules,"Inseong Jo,Joonbum Bae,","In this paper, a wearable hand exoskeleton with force-controllable and compact actuator modules is proposed. In order to apply force feedback accurately while allowing natural finger motions, the exoskeleton linkage structure with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) was designed, which was inspired by the muscular skeletal structure of the finger. As an actuating system, a series elastic actuator (SEA) mechanism, which consisted of a small linear motor, a manually designed motor driver, a spring and potentiometers, was applied. The friction of the motor was identified and compensated for obtaining a linearized model of the actuating system. Using a LQ (linear quadratic) tuned PD (proportional and derivative) controller and a disturbance observer (DOB), the proposed actuator module could generate the desired force accurately with actual finger movements. By integrating together the proposed exoskeleton structure, actuator modules and control algorithms, a wearable hand exoskeleton with force-controllable and compact actuator modules was developed to deliver accurate force to the fingertips for flexion/extension motions."

This role adaptation is engaged whenever the interaction force changes, causing the proportion of control sharing between human and robot to vary. In one boundary condition, the robot takes full control of the system when there is no human intervention. In the other boundary condition, it becomes a follower when the human exhibits strong intention to lead the task. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields better overall performance than fixed-role interactions."
icra,None,Learning models for following natural language directions in unknown environments,"Sachithra Hemachandra,Felix Duvallet,Thomas M. Howard,Nicholas Roy,,,","Natural language offers an intuitive and flexible means for humans to communicate with the robots that we will increasingly work alongside in our homes and workplaces. Recent advancements have given rise to robots that are able to interpret natural language manipulation and navigation commands, but these methods require a prior map of the robot's environment. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that enables robots to successfully follow natural language route directions without any previous knowledge of the environment. The algorithm utilizes spatial and semantic information that the human conveys through the command to learn a distribution over the metric and semantic properties of spatially extended environments. Our method uses this distribution in place of the latent world model and interprets the natural language instruction as a distribution over the intended behavior. A novel belief space planner reasons directly over the map and behavior distributions to solve for a policy using imitation learning. We evaluate our framework on a voice-commandable wheelchair. The results demonstrate that by learning and performing inference over a latent environment model, the algorithm is able to successfully follow natural language route directions within novel, extended environments."
icra,None,An incremental approach to learning generalizable robot tasks from human demonstration,"Amir M. Ghalamzan E,Chris Paxton,Gregory D. Hager,Luca Bascetta,","Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) are a common method for learning a control policy for a task from demonstration. This control policy consists of differential equations that can create a smooth trajectory to a new goal point. However, DMPs only have a limited ability to generalize the demonstration to new environments and solve problems such as obstacle avoidance. Moreover, standard DMP learning does not cope with the noise inherent to human demonstrations. Here, we propose an approach for robot learning from demonstration that can generalize noisy task demonstrations to a new goal point and to an environment with obstacles. This strategy for robot learning from demonstration results in a control policy that incorporates different types of learning from demonstration, which correspond to different types of observational learning as outlined in developmental psychology."
icra,None,A kinematic controller for human-robot handshaking using internal motion adaptation,"Dimitrios Papageorgiou,Zoe Doulgeri,",This work proposes a kinematic control method for human-robot handshake motions achieving fast motion synchronization given a preset internal robot handshake motion and a compliance level that reflects the robot's level of passiveness. The proposed method combines a non-linear dynamic system having an attractive limit cycle with an admittance controller and an adaptation mechanism so that interaction forces are minimized and a consensus oscillation is achieved between the engaging participants. The proposed method is validated by experimenting with a KUKA LWR4+ 7dof arm under various scenarios.
icra,None,On handing down our tools to robots: Single-phase kinesthetic teaching for dynamic in-contact tasks,"Alberto Montebelli,Franz Steinmetz,Ville Kyrki,","We present a (generalizable) method aimed to simultaneously transfer positional and force requirements encoded in a physical human skill (wood planing) from a human instructor to a robotic arm through kinesthetic teaching. We achieve our goal through a novel use of a common sensory configuration, constituted by a force/torque sensor mounted between the tool and the flange of a robotic arm. The robotic arm is endowed with integrated torque sensors at each joint. The mathematical model used to capture the general dynamic of the interaction between the human user and the wood surface is based on Dynamic Movement Primitives. During reenactment of the task, the system can imitate and generalize the demonstrated spatial requirements, as well as their associated force profiles. Therefore, the robotic arm acquires the capacity to reproduce the dynamic profile for in-contact tasks requiring an articulated coordination in the distribution of forces. For example, the capacity to effectively operate the plane on a wood plank over multiple strokes, according to the demonstration of the human instructor."
icra,None,Intent aware adaptive admittance control for physical Human-Robot Interaction,"Isura Ranatunga,Sven Cremer,Dan O. Popa,Frank L. Lewis,","Effective physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) needs to account for variable human dynamics and also predict human intent. Recently, there has been a lot of progress in adaptive impedance and admittance control for human-robot interaction. Not as many contributions have been reported on online adaptation schemes that can accommodate users with varying physical strength and skill level during interaction with a robot. The goal of this paper is to present and evaluate a novel adaptive admittance controller that can incorporate human intent, nominal task models, as well as variations in the robot dynamics. An outer-loop controller is developed using an ARMA model which is tuned using an adaptive inverse control technique. An inner-loop neuroadaptive controller linearizes the robot dynamics. Working in conjunction and online, this two-loop technique offers an elegant way to decouple the pHRI problem. Experimental results are presented comparing the performance of different types of admittance controllers. The results show that efficient online adaptation of the robot admittance model for different human subjects can be achieved. Specifically, the adaptive admittance controller reduces jerk which results in a smooth human-robot interaction."
icra,None,Integral Admittance Shaping for exoskeleton control,"Umashankar Nagarajan,Gabriel Aguirre-Ollinger,Ambarish Goswami,","A wide variety of strategies have been developed for assisting human locomotion using powered exoskeletons. Although these strategies differ in their aims as well as the control methods employed, they have the implicit property of causing a virtual modification of the dynamic response of the human limb. We use this property of the exoskeletons action to formulate a unified control design framework called Integral Admittance Shaping, which designs exoskeleton controllers capable of producing the desired dynamic response for the assisted limb. In this framework, a virtual increase in the admittance of the limb is produced by coupling it to an exoskeleton that exhibits active behavior. Specifically, our framework shapes the magnitude profile of the integral admittance (i.e. torque-to-angle relationship) of the coupled human-exoskeleton system, such that the desired assistance is achieved. This framework also ensures that the coupled stability and passivity are guaranteed. This paper presents a formulation of Integral Admittance Shaping for single degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) exoskeleton devices. We also present experimental results on a modified version of Honda's Stride Management Assist (SMA) device that successfully demonstrate motion amplification of the assisted hip joint during walking."

The key idea of the proposal is the search of synergies of the dual-arm anthropomorphic system in order to use them to reduce the dimension of the search space while preserving human-like appearance. This idea was already developed and successfully used to plan movements of robotic hands, thus the extension to a dual-arm system is attractive. The paper presents a description of the proposed approach as well as real experimental results that encourage doing further research in this line."
icra,None,Whole-body self-calibration via graph-optimization and automatic configuration selection,"Daniel Maier,Stefan Wrobel,Maren Bennewitz,","In this paper, we present a novel approach to accurately calibrate the kinematic model of a humanoid based on observations of its monocular camera. Our technique estimates the parameters of the complete model, consisting of the joint angle offsets of the whole body including the legs, as well as the camera extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. We cast the parameter estimation as a least-squares optimization problem. In the error function, we consider the residuals between camera observations of end-effector markers and their projections into the image based on the estimate of the calibration parameters. Furthermore, we developed an approach to automatically select a subset of configurations for the calibration process that yields a good trade-off between the number of observations and accuracy. As the experiments with a Nao humanoid show, we achieve an accurate calibration for this low-cost platform. Further, our approach to configuration selection yields substantially better optimization results compared to randomly chosen viable configurations. Hence, our system only requires a reduced number of configurations to achieve accurate results. Our optimization is general and the implementation, which is available online, can easily be applied to different humanoids."
icra,None,Stance selection for humanoid grasping tasks by inverse reachability maps,"Felix Burget,Maren Bennewitz,","In grasping tasks carried out with humanoids, knowledge about the robot's reachable workspace is important. Without this knowledge, it might be necessary to repeatedly adapt the stance location and call an inverse kinematics solver before a valid robot configuration to reach a given grasping pose can be found. In this paper, we present an approach to select an optimal stance location in SE(2) for a humanoid robot's feet relative to a desired grasp pose. We use a precomputed representation of the robot's reachable workspace that stores quality information in addition to spatial data. By inverting this representation we obtain a so-called inverse reachability map (IRM) containing a collection of potential stance poses for the robot. The generated IRM can subsequently be used to select a statically stable, collision-free stance configuration to reach a given grasping target. We evaluated our approach with a Nao humanoid in simulation and in experiments with the real robot. As the experiments show, using our approach optimal stance poses can easily be obtained. Furthermore, the IRM leads to a substantially increased success rate of reaching grasping poses compared to other meaningful foot placements within the vicinity of the desired grasp."
icra,None,Optimal contact force distribution for compliant humanoid robots in whole-body loco-manipulation tasks,"Edoardo Farnioli,Marco Gabiccini,Antonio Bicchi,","The term whole-body loco-manipulation refers to the case in which a humanoid robot exploits contacts with the environment, both with the end-effectors and with its internal limbs, in order to balance, move and/or manipulate the environment. In such a situation, high degree of redundancy may not be sufficient to completely control the robot movements and/or the forces applied on the environment. This problem is tackled in this work by means of quasi-static analysis tools. The reduction of mobility and manipulability is studied introducing the Fundamental Loco-Manipulation Matrix (FLMM) and its canonical form (cFLMM). Relevant information on the system can be extracted from those, obtaining, e.g., the space of the controllable contact forces, and the controllable displacements of the center of mass. Furthermore, the best contact force distribution able to meet the friction cone constraints is demonstrated to be the solution of a convex optimization problem. The validity of the proposed methods is verified in two numerical examples, where internal contacts affects the controllability of both forces and displacements. Numerical results show that is crucial to consider the correlations between contact forces in order to exert target actions on the environment while coping with friction limits on the whole set of contacts."
icra,None,Whole-body pushing manipulation with contact posture planning of large and heavy object for humanoid robot,"Masaki Murooka,Shunichi Nozawa,Yohei Kakiuchi,Kei Okada,Masayuki Inaba,","Humanoid robot is able to execute various behavior to manipulate objects because of high degree-of-freedom around the whole-body. Although hands contact with objects and exert force in ordinary pushing motion by robot, pushing motion contacting with the object at various regions of whole-body has potential for extending the scope of feasible manipulation. We derive the fundamental formulas of humanoid robot in the situation that the external force is applied to the arbitrary region of whole-body, and then propose the method to generate and execute the pushing motion based on the formulas. The proposed method is generalized for enabling to select a contact point with an object from whole-body regions and control the pushing force applied to the sensorless region. In order to verify the effectiveness, we show the experimental result that a lifesized humanoid carries large and heavy objects by pushing with various regions of whole-body."

By approximately calculating the MOA set via sample point cloud, we can obtain an analytic form of the MOA set even on a nonlinear system. Formulation provided in this paper can be applicable to various types of controllers. Using the MOA set, we demonstrate a motion transition from a standing posture to steady walking. Switching two types of controllers based on the MOA set realizes motion transition with the COP constraint satisfied. The validity of proposed method is verified with a simulation."
icra,None,Optimal use of arm-swing for bipedal walking control,"Taisuke Kobayashi,Kosuke Sekiyama,Tadayoshi Aoyama,Yasuhisa Hasegawa,,","Walking capability composed of stability and efficiency is one of the most important issues in the field of humanoid robots. An effective swing of the arms is expected to enhance the walking capability under the constraints from the limited body. We propose an arm-swing method to enhance the stability and efficiency by selecting optimal arm-swing strategy depending on the walking conditions. In this research, we select the optimal strategy between the support of the center of gravity (COG) tracking for stability and the walk without arm-swing for efficiency. To support the COG tracking, we employ a predictive control. States are defined as an inverted pendulum model and inputs are given as an inertial force of arm-swing. Input and output weights in the predictive control are adjustable by a support weight introduced in this paper. Selection of the optimal support weight by a selection algorithm for locomotion (Su-SAL) switches the two strategies by adjusting the ratio of input and output (I/O) weights. Su-SAL maximizes the efficiency while keeping the stability in comparison with the case of the constant support weight."
icra,None,Dynamics morphing between standing and repetitive hopping of biped robots,"Hiroshi Atsuta,Tomomichi Sugihara,","This paper presents a repetitive hopping control of biped robots, which has the following properties: 1) It can initiate or cease hopping at any time, 2) The peak altitude can be freely altered during hopping, and 3) The impact at touchdown is suppressed. Hopping motions accompany frequent changes of contact conditions with the environment and lead the discontinuity of dynamics they are governed, therefore, it is difficult to achieve the motion in a way without relying any passive mechanisms such as springs and dampers. Three controllers, that is, (I) a regulator to stabilize, (II) a controller to converge a desired velocity when lifting off the ground and (III) a controller to absorb the landing impact are unified by the global scheme to transit each other depending on a commanded value and the state of the robot."
icra,None,Dynamic walking in a humanoid robot based on a 3D Actuated Dual-SLIP model,"Yiping Liu,Patrick M. Wensing,David E. Orin,Yuan F. Zheng,","This paper presents a method for the generation of dynamic walking gaits with a 3D Dual-SLIP model and its application to a simulated Hubo+ based humanoid. Previous approaches with the Dual-SLIP model have only focused on the planar case, wherein self-stable gaits can be found. When extended to 3D here, this model has not been found to exhibit self-stable gaits, requiring new methods for gait optimization and control. By taking advantage of a newly discovered symmetry condition for the Dual-SLIP model, this work proposes a quarter period (half step) optimization process to find periodic walking gaits in 3D. An LQR controller is developed to regulate the state of the model at leg midstance (MS) based on its return map dynamics. The Dual-SLIP model is extended by introducing a bio-inspired leg length actuation scheme in order to describe high-speed walking gaits (up to 2 m/s for human-compatible parameters). Finally, the CoM trajectory and footstep positions from the 3D Dual-SLIP are used as a reference in a task-space controller with a Hubo+ based humanoid model. By tracking these references, the methods successfully produce human-like dynamic walking gaits in simulation which are robust to disturbances. The whole-body control system for walking can handle uneven terrain with variation up to 10% of its leg length. This represents the first humanoid dynamic walking approach based on a 3D Dual-SLIP model."

In this paper, we quantify the stability of such a control system on rough terrain by estimating the expected number of steps before failure. In addition, we show how to switch between multiple HZD controllers (optionally using terrain look-ahead) to increase the stability dramatically, e.g., 10 thousand steps compared to 10. To do this robustly, we make use of the new meshing method proposed in this paper."
icra,None,Compliant locomotion using whole-body control and Divergent Component of Motion tracking,"Michael A. Hopkins,Dennis W. Hong,Alexander Leonessa,","This paper presents a compliant locomotion framework for torque-controlled humanoids using model-based whole-body control. In order to stabilize the centroidal dynamics during locomotion, we compute linear momentum rate of change objectives using a novel time-varying controller for the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM). Task-space objectives, including the desired momentum rate of change, are tracked using an efficient quadratic program formulation that computes optimal joint torque setpoints given frictional contact constraints and joint position / torque limits. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we demonstrate push recovery and compliant walking using THOR, a 34 DOF humanoid with series elastic actuation. We discuss details leading to the successful implementation of optimization-based whole-body control on our hardware platform, including the design of a “simple” joint impedance controller that introduces inner-loop velocity feedback into the actuator force controller."

Hurst,,","Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for the stable control of bipedal robotic gaits, but typically designing a gait's virtual constraints is a slow and undependable optimization process. To expedite and boost the reliability of HZD gait generation, we borrow methods from trajectory optimization to formulate a smoother and more linear optimization problem. We present a multiple-shooting formulation for the optimization of virtual constraints, combining the stability-friendly properties of HZD with an optimization-conducive problem formulation. To showcase the implications of this recipe for improving gait generation, we use the same process to generate periodic planar walking gaits on two different robot models, and in one case, demonstrate stable walking on the hardware prototype, DURUS-R."
icra,None,"The Reaction Mass Biped: Equations of motion, hybrid model for walking and trajectory tracking control","Koushil Sreenath,Amit K. Sanyal,","Pendulum models have been studied as benchmark problems for development of nonlinear control schemes, as well as reduced-order models for the dynamics analysis of locomotion of humanoid robots. This work provides a generalization of the previously introduced Reaction Mass Pendulum (RMP), which is a multibody inverted pendulum model, to a bipedal model that can better model bipedal locomotion. The RMP consists of an extensible “leg” and a “body” with moving proof masses that give rise to a variable rotational inertia. The Reaction Mass Biped (RMB) introduced here has two legs, one of which takes the role of a stance leg and the other performs as a swing leg during bipedal locomotion. The bipedal walking dynamics model of the RMB is therefore hybrid, with the roles of stance leg and swing leg interchanged after each cycle. The dynamics model is developed using a variational mechanics approach, without using generalized coordinates for the rotational degrees of freedom. This dynamics model has thirteen degrees of freedom, all of which are considered to be actuated in the control design. A set of desired state trajectories that can enable bipedal walking in straight and curved lines are generated. A control scheme is then designed for asymptotically stable tracking of this set of trajectories with an almost global domain of attraction. Numerical simulation results confirm the stability of this tracking control scheme for different walking trajectories of the RMB."
icra,None,Realizing underactuated bipedal walking with torque controllers via the ideal model resolved motion method,"Eric Cousineau,Aaron D. Ames,","This paper presents experimentally realized bipedal robotic walking using ideal torque controllers via a novel approach termed the ideal model resolved motion method (IM-RMM), where a system's ideal closed-loop dynamics are integrated forward from the actual state of the hardware to provide desired positions and velocity commands to a PD controller. By combining this method with gaits generated using the Human-Inspired Control framework, walking was realized experimentally on the DURUS platform, designed and built by SRI, and achieved with minimal system identification. For comparison, two controllers, one using feedback linearization and one using Control Lyapunov Function based Quadratic Programs (CLF-QP), both realized through IM-RMM, are compared with a benchmark procedure, the Hybrid Zero Dynamics reconstruction, that is shown to provide reliable walking in literature. The results of both simulations and experiments are presented, with the CLF-QP implemented via IM-RMM resulting in the lowest experimental specific energetic cost of transport of c et = 0.63 achieved during sustained walking on the 31.5 kg bipedal robot."
icra,None,Analytical approximation for the double-stance phase of a walking robot,"M. Shahbazi,R. Babuška,G.A.D. Lopes,","This paper introduces an approximate analytical solution to the otherwise non-integrable double-stance dynamics of the bipedal spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). Despite the apparent structural simplicity of the SLIP, the exact analytical solution to its stance dynamics cannot be found. Approximate maps have been proposed for the monoped SLIP runner (encompassing a single-stance phase). Still, even in an approximate form, a solution to the double-stance dynamics of the bipedal SLIP walker remained an open problem. We propose a double-stance map that can be readily utilized especially in the design of control systems for active dynamic walking. The accuracy of the derived map over a feasible range of locomotion properties is analyzed numerically, and a control application based on this solution is presented. Simulations for an arbitrary chosen energy level reveals that the devised controller enlarges the stable walking domain of the standard SLIP considerably."
icra,None,Quiet (nearly collisionless) robotic walking,"Mario W. Gomes,Konrad Ahlin,","We present a simple walking prototype that is capable of demonstrating an efficient, near-collisionless gait down a ramp. This inertia-coupled rimless wheel is able to “walk” down a 3° incline, which corresponds to a cost of transport of approximately 0.05. This is the first device designed to demonstrate the concept of collisionless walking, where energy-loss due to foot/ground collisions is minimized by matching the velocity of the foot and the ground at the moment of impact. We also present and analyze a novel torsional spring design which was used to couple the inertia device to the frame. We conjecture that walking robots based on this design will be able to exploit the concept of collisionless gaits and may be able to achieve significantly more energy-efficient walking than existing robot designs."

The constraints resulting from the inter-image alignments within an image set are stored in an undirected graph structure allowing efficient optimization of image projections on the plane. Camera pose is also directly recoverable from the graph, making Smartpig a feasible solution to the problem of simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM). Smartpig is demonstrated on a set of 144 high resolution aerial images and evaluated with a number of metrics against ground control."
icra,None,Online SLAM with any-time self-calibration and automatic change detection,"Nima Keivan,Gabe Sibley,","A framework for online simultaneous localization, mapping and self-calibration is presented which can detect and handle significant change in the calibration parameters. Estimates are computed in constant-time by factoring the problem and focusing on segments of the trajectory that are most informative for the purposes of calibration. A novel technique is presented to detect the probability that a significant change is present in the calibration parameters. The system is then able to re-calibrate. Maximum likelihood trajectory and map estimates are computed using an asynchronous and adaptive optimization. The system requires no prior information and is able to initialize without any special motions or routines, or in the case where observability over calibration parameters is delayed. The system is experimentally validated to calibrate camera intrinsic parameters for a nonlinear camera model on a monocular dataset featuring a significant zoom event partway through, and achieves high accuracy despite unknown initial calibration parameters. Self-calibration and re-calibration parameters are shown to closely match estimates computed using a calibration target. The accuracy of the system is demonstrated with SLAM results that achieve sub-1% distance-travel error even in the presence of significant re-calibration events."
icra,None,"Introducing SLAMBench, a performance and accuracy benchmarking methodology for SLAM","Luigi Nardi,Bruno Bodin,M. Zeeshan Zia,John Mawer,Andy Nisbet,,,,,,,,","Real-time dense computer vision and SLAM offer great potential for a new level of scene modelling, tracking and real environmental interaction for many types of robot, but their high computational requirements mean that use on mass market embedded platforms is challenging. Meanwhile, trends in low-cost, low-power processing are towards massive parallelism and heterogeneity, making it difficult for robotics and vision researchers to implement their algorithms in a performance-portable way. In this paper we introduce SLAMBench, a publicly-available software framework which represents a starting point for quantitative, comparable and validatable experimental research to investigate trade-offs in performance, accuracy and energy consumption of a dense RGB-D SLAM system. SLAMBench provides a KinectFusion implementation in C++, OpenMP, OpenCL and CUDA, and harnesses the ICL-NUIM dataset of synthetic RGB-D sequences with trajectory and scene ground truth for reliable accuracy comparison of different implementation and algorithms. We present an analysis and breakdown of the constituent algorithmic elements of KinectFusion, and experimentally investigate their execution time on a variety of multicore and GPU-accelerated platforms. For a popular embedded platform, we also present an analysis of energy efficiency for different configuration alternatives."
icra,None,Appearance-based SLAM in a network space,"Padraig Corcoran,Ted J. Steiner,Michela Bertolotto,John J. Leonard,","The task of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is regularly performed in network spaces consisting of a set of corridors connecting locations in the space. Empirical research has demonstrated that such spaces generally exhibit common structural properties relating to aspects such as corridor length. Consequently there exists potential to improve performance through the placement of priors over these properties. In this work we propose an appearance-based SLAM method which explicitly models the space as a network and in turn uses this model as a platform to place priors over its structure. Relative to existing works, which implicitly assume a network space and place priors over its structure, this approach allows a more formal placement of priors. In order to achieve robustness, the proposed method is implemented within a multi-hypothesis tracking framework. Results achieved on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms a current state-of-the-art appearance-based SLAM method."
icra,None,Image based optimisation without global consistency for constant time monocular visual SLAM,"Vincent Lui,Tom Drummond,","This paper presents a monocular visual SLAM system that does not require a globally consistent 3D model. Instead of generating a globally consistent 3D model and localising the camera from the 3D model, the system merely optimises relative pose parameters for pairs of keyframes that overlap on the scene, providing accurate local information at the expense of global consistency. During run-time, the camera is localised using only 2D measurements from nearby keyframes instead of using correspondences between 2D measurements and 3D features of a 3D model. Extensive experiments using both synthetic and real data sets were performed to evaluate the system's performance. Results show that our system is accurate and runs in real time at an average of 25 frames per second on a standard computer. Finally, we also show how useful applications can be easily developed on top of a framework without global consistency."
icra,None,Distributed real-time cooperative localization and mapping using an uncertainty-aware expectation maximization approach,"Jing Dong,Erik Nelson,Vadim Indelman,Nathan Michael,Frank Dellaert,","We demonstrate distributed, online, and real-time cooperative localization and mapping between multiple robots operating throughout an unknown environment using indirect measurements. We present a novel Expectation Maximization (EM) based approach to efficiently identify inlier multi-robot loop closures by incorporating robot pose uncertainty, which significantly improves the trajectory accuracy over long-term navigation. An EM and hypothesis based method is used to determine a common reference frame. We detail a 2D laser scan correspondence method to form robust correspondences between laser scans shared amongst robots. The implementation is experimentally validated using teams of aerial vehicles, and analyzed to determine its accuracy, computational efficiency, scalability to many robots, and robustness to varying environments. We demonstrate through multiple experiments that our method can efficiently build maps of large indoor and outdoor environments in a distributed, online, and real-time setting."
icra,None,M3RSM: Many-to-many multi-resolution scan matching,"Edwin Olson,","We describe a new multi-resolution scan matching method that makes exhaustive (and thus local-minimum-proof) matching practical, even for large positional uncertainties. Unlike earlier multi-resolution methods, in which putative matches at low-resolutions can lead the matcher to an incorrect solution, our method generates exactly the same answer as a brute-force full-resolution method. We provide a proof of this. Novelly, our method allows decimation of both the look-up table and in the point cloud, yielding a 10x speedup versus contemporary correlative methods. When a robot closes a large-scale loop, it must often consider many loop-closure candidates. In this paper, we describe an approach for posing a scan matching query over these candidates jointly, finding the best match(es) between a particular pose and a set of candidate poses (“one-to-many”), or the best match between two sets of poses (“many-to-many”). This mode of operation finds the first loop closure as much as 45x faster than traditional “one-to-one” scan matching."
icra,None,A convex relaxation for approximate global optimization in simultaneous localization and mapping,"David M. Rosen,Charles DuHadway,John J. Leonard,","Modern approaches to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) formulate the inference problem as a high-dimensional but sparse nonconvex M-estimation, and then apply general first- or second-order smooth optimization methods to recover a local minimizer of the objective function. The performance of any such approach depends crucially upon initializing the optimization algorithm near a good solution for the inference problem, a condition that is often difficult or impossible to guarantee in practice. To address this limitation, in this paper we present a formulation of the SLAM M-estimation with the property that, by expanding the feasible set of the estimation program, we obtain a convex relaxation whose solution approximates the globally optimal solution of the SLAM inference problem and can be recovered using a smooth optimization method initialized at any feasible point. Our formulation thus provides a means to obtain a high-quality solution to the SLAM problem without requiring high-quality initialization."
icra,None,A novel degree of freedom in flapping wings shows promise for a dual aerial/aquatic vehicle propulsor,"Jacob S. Izraelevitz,Michael S. Triantafyllou,","Ocean sampling for highly temporal phenomena, such as harmful algal blooms, necessitates a vehicle capable of fast aerial travel interspersed with an aquatic means of acquiring in-situ measurements. Vehicle platforms with this capability have yet to be widely adopted by the oceanographic community. Several animal examples successfully make this aerial/aquatic transition using a flapping foil actuator, offering an existence proof for a viable vehicle design (Fig. 1).We discuss a preliminary realization of a flapping wing actuation system for use in both air and water. The wing employs an active in-line motion degree of freedom to generate the large force envelope necessary for propulsion in both fluid media."
icra,None,Platform design and tethered flight of a motor-driven flapping-wing system,"Lindsey Hines,David Colmenares,Metin Sitti,","In this work, we examine two design modifications to a tethered motor-driven flapping-wing system. Previously, we had demonstrated a simple mechanism utilizing a linear transmission for resonant operation and direct drive of the wing flapping angle for control. The initial two-wing system had a weight of 2.7 grams and a maximum lift-to-weight ratio of 1.4. While capable of vertical takeoff, in open-loop flight it demonstrated instability and pitch oscillations at the wing flapping frequency, leading to flight times of only a few wing strokes. Here the effect of vertical wing offset as well as an alternative multi-wing layout is investigated and experimentally tested with newly constructed prototypes. With only a change in vertical wing offset, stable open-loop flight of the two-wing flapping system is shown to be theoretically possible, but difficult to achieve with our current design and operating parameters. Both of the new two and four-wing systems, however, prove capable of flying to the end of the tether, with the four-wing system prototype eliminating disruptive wing beat oscillations."
icra,None,Attitude and altitude estimation and control on board a Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicle,"J.L. Verboom,S. Tijmons,C. De Wagter,B. Remes,R. Babuska,,","The autonomous capabilities of light-weight Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAVs) have much to gain from onboard state estimation and attitude control. In this article, we present the first FWMAV with robust onboard state estimation and attitude control. The tailed FWMAV DelFly II was used, with the main goal to achieve active stabilization in the (passively unstable) hover condition. The attitude is estimated using an Inertial Measurement Unit with a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer and the altitude is estimated using a barometer. A major challenge lies in the disturbance of the accelerometer measurements by the flapping motion of the wings. We propose a mechanical damping mechanism and flap-cycle based filtering to resolve this issue. The pitch estimates have a mean error of 1.5° with respect to the ground-truth measurement from a motion capture system. Using the onboard pitch estimate we can control the attitude of the FWMAV in the forward flight regime with a 30% lower standard deviation than in a trimmed flight. With a different set of gains, the FWMAV is able to perform a hovering flight - showing that a tailed FWMAV has enough control authority for this task. In a fully autonomous hover experiment, the DelFly II stays within a sphere of 0.75 m radius."
icra,None,Adaptive robust wing trajectory control and force generation of flapping wing MAV,"Jian Zhang,Bo Cheng,Bin Yao,Xinyan Deng,","The prominent maneuverability of flapping flight is enabled by rapid and significant changes in aerodynamic forces, which is a result of surprisingly subtle and precise changes of wing kinematics. The high sensitivity of aerodynamic forces to wing kinematic changes demands precise and instantaneous control of the flapping wing trajectories, especially in the presence of various types of uncertainties. In this work, we first present a dynamic model of a pair of direct-motor-driven flapping wings while taking into consideration the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. We then present an Adaptive Robust Controller (ARC) to achieve robust performance of high-frequency (over 30Hz) instantaneous wing trajectory tracking with onboard feedback. The proposed control algorithm was experimentally validated on a 7.5 gram flapping-wing MAV which showed excellent tracking of various wing trajectories with different amplitude, bias, frequency, and split-cycles. Experimental results on various model wings demonstrated that the ARC can adapt to unknown parameters and show no performance degradation across wings of different geometries. The results of ARC were also compared with those of open-loop and classical PID controllers."
icra,None,A new model for self-organized robotic clustering: Understanding boundary induced densities and cluster compactness,"Jung-Hwan Kim,Dylan A. Shell,","For self-organized multi-robot systems, one of the widely studied task domains is object clustering, which involves gathering randomly scattered objects into a few piles. Earlier studies have pointed out that environmental boundaries influence the cluster formation process, generally causing clusters to form around the perimeter rather than centrally within the workspace. But it is usually central clusters that are desired in robotic clustering systems. In this paper, we derive general conditions that prevent the problem of boundaries causing perimeter clusters. We develop a mathematical model to explain how sets of clusters evolve into a single cluster without any boundary cluster being formed. Through analysis of the model, we show that time-averaged spatial densities of the robots play a significant role in producing conditions that ensure a single central cluster emerges. Thus, local densities of robots can be considered a system-level control parameter to achieve this task. We further investigate how the physical packing of clusters affects clustering dynamics. To do this, we introduce a measure of scaled compactness and show that the lifetime of clusters is well predicted by this descriptor."
icra,None,Gaussian reconstruction of swarm behavior from partial data,"Glenn Wagner,Howie Choset,","Swarms consist of large numbers of individual agents that generally maintain no fixed relative positions, which makes describing the behavior of the swarm as a whole difficult. Furthermore, the high number of agents leads to frequent occlusions that prevent observations of the entire swarm. In this paper, we represent the behavior of swarms using velocity fields, yielding a description which is invariant to the number of agents in a swarm, and the position, orientation, and scale of the swarm. The velocity field representation allows the behavior of swarms to be modeled as a Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that this Gaussian model can be used to reconstruct the behavior of the swarm as a whole from partial observations."

Daltorio,,","RAMBLER Robot is designed for researching insect inspired behavioral control algorithms. To evaluate these algorithms, RAMBLER Robot needs autonomous localization without typical sensors like wheel odometers or GPS. The primary objective of this work is to independently, accurately, and robustly recover the path of a moving robotic system with low-cost sensors available off-the-shelf. The computationally efficient power center method of triangulation is compared to a particle filter approach. With three passive indistinguishable landmarks at corners of a small arena, RAMBLER Robot successfully localizes with an RMS error of 2.27cm compared to an overhead camera ground truth."
icra,None,Robot-inspired biology: The compound-wave control template,"Jin Dai,Matthew Travers,Tony Dear,Chaohui Gong,Henry C. Astley,,,","Biologically inspired robots perform many interesting and useful behaviors, but to effectively emulate their biological counterparts, robots often need to possess many degrees of freedom, complicating their mechanical design and making it difficult to apply standard control and motion planning strategies. To address this complexity, the robotics community has derived low-dimensional parameter-based controllers that naturally coordinate many degrees of freedom such as the serpenoid curves used to control snake robots. Controllers utilizing this parameterization for snake robots have been able to induce behaviors similar to that of the robots' biological counterparts. A similar concept, called a control template, is used in the study of animal movements. However, much of the prior work on control templates has been limited to in-plane motion. In this work, we extend the usage of control templates to three dimensions to both better model and understand biology, as well as to help us gain better intuition into how we can use pre-existing control paradigms to create new behaviors for biologically inspired robots."
icra,None,Analysis of muscle synergy contribution on human standing-up motion using a neuro-musculoskeletal model,"Qi An,Yuki Ishikawa,Shinya Aoi,Tetsuro Funato,Hiroyuki Oka,Hiroshi Yamakawa,,,","It is important to understand the mechanism of human standing-up motion to improve the declined physical ability of the elderly people. This study employs the concept of muscle synergies (modular structure of coordinative muscle activation) to understand how humans coordinate their muscles to achieve the standing-up motion. Neuro-musculoskeletal model was developed to represent human body to generate standing-up motion. Using the developed model, forward dynamic simulation was used to analyze how humans utilized the muscle synergies to realize the motion. Results showed that the developed model could generate the standing-up motion with four muscle synergies rather than controlling individual muscles. Moreover, further analysis showed that three different strategies of the standing-up motion could be generated only by changing the start time of the particular muscle synergy."
icra,None,Optimal design of a physical assistive device to support sit-to-stand motions,"Khai-Long Ho Hoang,Katja D. Mombaur,","The MOBOT* project aims to develop assistive devices that support elderly patients with mobility disabilities during gait and sit-to-stand (STS) transfer. The device is supposed to help such patients to maintain an independent life through mobility as well as to regain basic life skills since self-effort is encouraged. Situation-adapted optimal assistance will be provided by the device both proactively and adaptively through behavior-based and context-aware robot control based on multimodal action recognition. The design of such a device, including the choice of actuators, which can provide the desired level of support without losing balance, is a challenging task. For these design choices, in particular STS motions have to be considered since they are more demanding for both the patient and the device. In this paper, we present a model-based optimization approach to this design task, using direct multiple shooting optimal control methods. They are applied to simultaneously determine optimal states and controls as well as the optimal mechanical design parameters of the assistive device that provide optimal STS assistance to subjects from a range of body heights and weights that represents the MOBOT target group."
icra,None,Tandem stance avoidance using adaptive and asymmetric admittance control for fall prevention,"Shotaro Nakagawa,Pei Di,Yasuhisa Hasegawa,Toshio Fukuda,,,,","Fall prevention is one of the most important functions of walking assistance devices for user's safety. It is preferable that these devices obviates factors which induce falling over rather than helping them recovering from falling motion. Tandem stance, where both legs form a line along walking direction, is a factor of falling. It is often observed in turning motion because a swing leg moves in lateral direction as well as forward. Generally, upper body's turning of a person proceeds before lower limb's turning during walking, and the behavior of the lower limb is constrained by upper body turning. It is thus possible to control behavior of the lower limb for tandem stance prevention by constraining behavior of the upper body. This paper therefore introduces a tandem stance prevention method for safer walk of the elderly or physically challenged person. The method adjusts admittance of cane robot's turning motion according to the positions of a support leg and a swing leg. The cane robot measures user's leg position and estimates a walk phase of the user. By adjusting an admittance model of the cane robot based on the walk phase, the cane robot resists to turn while support leg is on the same side of the turning direction. As a result, the tandem stance is avoided. Through experiments, we confirmed that the cane robot successfully controls user's upper body's behavior to prevent the user from being in tandem stance."
icra,None,Design and implementation of an instrumented cane for gait recognition,"Joshua Wade,Marco Beccani,Alec Myszka,Esubalew Bekele,Pietro Valdastri,,,,,","Independent mobility is an important aspect of an individual's life and must sometimes be augmented by use of an assistive device such as a wheeled walker or cane following a fall, injury, or functional decline. Physical therapists perform functional gait assessments to gauge the probability of an individual experiencing a fall and often recommend use of a walker, cane, or walking stick to decrease fall risk. Our team has developed a clinical assessment tool centered on a standard walking cane embedded system that can enhance a therapist's observation-based gait assessment with use of additional objective and quantitative data. This system can be utilized to detect timing and speed of cane placement, angular acceleration of the cane, and amounts of weight borne on the cane. This system is designed to assist physical therapists at the basic level in collection of objective data during gait analysis, to facilitate appropriate assistive gait device prescription, to provide patients and therapists feedback during gait training, and to reduce wrist and shoulder injuries with cane usage. However, more importantly, using the plethora of objective data that can be obtained from this cane, automated gait analysis and gait pattern classification can be performed to understand a patient's walking performance."

Closed-loop system stability has been investigated using a combination of the Circle Criterion and the Small-Gain Theorem to account both for time-delay and the time-varying adaptive ANN training. Experiments to investigate the performance of the proposed framework are reported."
icra,None,Depth image based gait tracking and analysis via robotic walker,"Chung Dial Lim,Ching-Ying Cheng,Chia-Ming Wang,Yen Chao,,","In this paper, we propose a gait tracking and analysis method using a depth image sensor installed on robotic walker. Nowadays, robotic walker not only can assist elders who have suffered deteriorating mobility but also help to provide rehabilitating function to people who have crippled walking ability. This approach is meant to be sufficiently accurate, non-intrusive, and low-cost. The goal of this research is to enable the robotic walker to become more active in terms of walker control and comfortable user experiences thorough gait analysis. In experiment, the accuracy of the proposed 3D leg pose tracking method was evaluated by a motion capture system and the result is quite promising. After actual trials, the proposed method has the potential to be used in a safer and more reliable application such as those assisting elders and specific group of patient subjects."
icra,None,Dynamic brace for correction of abnormal postures of the human spine,"Joon-Hyuk Park,Paul Stegall,Sunil K. Agrawal,","This paper describes the design and control architectures for a novel active thoracolumbosacral orthosis targeted at correction of abnormal postures and treatment of the human spine, often seen in adolescent idiopathic or neuromuscular scoliosis. Our novel device is motivated by the current limitations of the rigid braces used for this purpose which do not adapt to changes in the skeletal system in response to treatment. In addition, the dynamic brace can open possibilities for new treatment methods which currently do not exist. Previous brace designs were not capable of providing dynamic controlled forces. Our design utilizes two Stewart-Gough platforms in series, each controlled independently, either in position or force modes. The design can provide controlled forces/torques on different regions of spine to modify the posture. Additionally, it can control the motion of different regions of the spine through independent position control of each platform using six parallel actuators. Both control methods were validated in benchtop tests. A range of motion study was also performed with a healthy subject wearing the device while the system was controlled in transparent mode."
icra,None,Optimal control-on-request: An application in real-time assistive balance control,"Anastasia Mavrommati,Alex Ansari,Todd D. Murphey,","This paper presents a method for shared control where real-time bursts of optimal control assistance are applied by an observer on-demand to aid a simulated figure in maintaining balance. The proposed Assistive Controller (AC) calculates the optimal burst control fast, in real time, while accounting for nonlinearities of the dynamic model. The short duration of the AC signals allows a rapid transfer of control authority between the nominal and the assistive controller. This scheme avoids prolonged loss of nominal control authority on the part of the figure while facilitating the real-time integration of an external observer's guidance through the assistive control. We demonstrate the benefits of this control scheme in simulation using the Robot Operating System (ROS), in a context where the nominal controller fails to stabilize the figure and the AC is activated intermittently to not only keep it from falling but to additionally push it back to the upright position. The example signifies the efficiency of the proposed model-based AC even in the absence of force/pressure sensors. This approach presents an opportunity for using exoskeletons in balance support, fall prevention, and therapy. In particular, our simulation results indicate that a therapist equipped with an AC interface can, with minimal effort, increase active participation on the part of the patient while ensuring their safety."
icra,None,Reduction of off-tracking effects in an n-trailer emulated through a multi-agent robot mobile system,"Jaime González-Sierra,Eduardo Aranda-Bricaire,","This paper proposes the emulation of the socalled kingpin mechanism in order to reduce the off-tracking effects exhibited by the standard and generalized n-trailer systems. In turn, both systems are emulated by a group of differential-drive mobile robots trough time-varying relative position vectors using the leader-follower scheme. A control law is proposed which involves the position of the virtual sliding kingpin mechanism. It is shown that when the virtual kingpin mechanism is used in the control law, the off-tracking effects are significantly reduced compared to when this virtual mechanism is not used. Numerical simulations and real-time experiments show the performance of the proposed control law."

Each agent repeatedly employs a stop-and-go strategy consisting of the following three actions: (1) Estimate the bearing of agents in its vicinity, (2) compute a target point based on the estimates, and (3) move to that target point. The motivation and case study example is a modular robot, the Distributed Flight Array, which we employ to validate the proposed algorithm."
icra,None,Gesture based human - Multi-robot swarm interaction and its application to an interactive display,"J. Alonso-Mora,S. Haegeli Lohaus,P. Leemann,R. Siegwart,P. Beardsley,","A taxonomy for gesture-based interaction between a human and a group (swarm) of robots is described. Methods are classified into two categories. First, free-form interaction, where the robots are unconstrained in position and motion and the user can use deictic gestures to select subsets of robots and assign target goals and trajectories. Second, shape-constrained interaction, where the robots are in a configuration shape that can be modified by the user. In the later, the user controls a subset of meaningful degrees of freedom defining the overall shape instead of each robot directly. A multi-robot interactive display is described where a depth sensor is used to recognize human gesture, determining the commands sent to a group comprising tens of robots. Experimental results with a preliminary user study show the usability of the system."
icra,None,Decoupled multiagent path planning via incremental sequential convex programming,"Yufan Chen,Mark Cutler,Jonathan P. How,","This paper presents a multiagent path planning algorithm based on sequential convex programming (SCP) that finds locally optimal trajectories. Previous work using SCP efficiently computes motion plans in convex spaces with no static obstacles. In many scenarios where the spaces are non-convex, previous SCP-based algorithms failed to find feasible solutions because the convex approximation of collision constraints leads to forming a sequence of infeasible optimization problems. This paper addresses this problem by tightening collision constraints incrementally, thus forming a sequence of more relaxed, feasible intermediate optimization problems. We show that the proposed algorithm increases the probability of finding feasible trajectories by 33% for teams of more than three vehicles in non-convex environments. Further, we show that decoupling the multiagent optimization problem to a number of single-agent optimization problems leads to significant improvement in computational tractability. We develop a decoupled implementation of the proposed algorithm, abbreviated dec-iSCP. We show that dec-iSCP runs 14% faster and finds feasible trajectories with higher probability than a decoupled implementation of previous SCP-based algorithms. The proposed algorithm is real-time implementable and is validated through hardware experiments on a team of quadrotors."
icra,None,Decentralized control of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes using belief space macro-actions,"Shayegan Omidshafiei,Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi,Christopher Amato,,","The focus of this paper is on solving multi-robot planning problems in continuous spaces with partial observability. Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are general models for multi-robot coordination problems, but representing and solving Dec-POMDPs is often intractable for large problems. To allow for a high-level representation that is natural for multi-robot problems and scalable to large discrete and continuous problems, this paper extends the Dec-POMDP model to the Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (Dec-POSMDP). The Dec-POSMDP formulation allows asynchronous decision-making by the robots, which is crucial in multi-robot domains. We also present an algorithm for solving this Dec-POSMDP which is much more scalable than previous methods since it can incorporate closed-loop belief space macro-actions in planning. These macro-actions are automatically constructed to produce robust solutions. The proposed method's performance is evaluated on a complex multi-robot package delivery problem under uncertainty, showing that our approach can naturally represent multi-robot problems and provide high-quality solutions for large-scale problems."
icra,None,A distributed noise-resistant Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for high-dimensional multi-robot learning,"Ezequiel Di Mario,Iñaki Navarro,Alcherio Martinoli,","Population-based learning techniques have been proven to be effective in dealing with noise in numerical benchmark functions and are thus promising tools for the high-dimensional optimization of controllers for multiple robots with limited sensing capabilities, which have inherently noisy performance evaluations. In this article, we apply a statistical technique called Optimal Computing Budget Allocation to improve the performance of Particle Swarm Optimization in the presence of noise for a multi-robot obstacle avoidance benchmark task. We present a new distributed PSO OCBA algorithm suitable for resource-constrained mobile robots due to its low requirements in terms of memory and limited local communication. Our results from simulation show that PSO OCBA outperforms other techniques for dealing with noise, achieving a more consistent progress and a better estimate of the ground-truth performance of candidate solutions. We then validate our simulations with real robot experiments where we compare the controller learned with our proposed algorithm to a potential field controller for obstacle avoidance in a cluttered environment. We show that they both achieve a high performance through different avoidance behaviors."
icra,None,Cooperative localization under message dropouts via a partially decentralized EKF scheme,"Solmaz S. Kia,Stephen Rounds,Sonia Martínez,","For a team of mobile robots with limited onboard resources, we propose a partially decentralized implementation of an extended Kalman filter for cooperative localization. In the proposed algorithm, unlike a fully centralized scheme that requires, at each timestep, information from the entire team to be gathered together and be processed by a single device, we only require that the robots communicate with a central command unit at the time of a measurement update. In addition, the computational and storage cost per robot in terms of the size of the team is reduced to O(1). Moreover, the algorithm is robust to occasional in-network communication link failures while the estimation update of the robots receiving the update message is of minimum variance. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in simulations."
icra,None,Prioritized group navigation with Formation Velocity Obstacles,"Ioannis Karamouzas,Stephen J. Guy,","We introduce the problem of navigating a group of robots having prioritized formations amidst static and dynamic obstacles. Our formulation allows users to define a number of template formations, each with a specified priority value. At each planning cycle, we compute a new formation which accounts for both these priority values and the safe progress of the robots towards their goal. To this end, we introduce a new velocity-based navigation approach which we denote as Formation Velocity Obstacles (FVO). Like other velocity-based approaches, FVO allows anticipatory collision avoidance accounting for the likely future motion of nearby obstacles. However, we extend these previous approaches and allow anisotropic agents which rotate themselves to orient along their direction of travel. We integrate these FVOs with a Bayesian framework to infer priority values for arbitrary formations from the user-given templates. The result is a complete framework for prioritized formation planning."

For instance, when considering integral region-based features such as image moments, only heuristic, partial, or local results are currently available for guiding the selection of an appropriate moment set. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel learning strategy able to automatically optimize online the shape of a given class of image moments as a function of the observed scene for improving the SfM performance in estimating the scene structure. As case study, the problem of recovering the (unknown) 3D parameters of a planar scene from measured moments and known camera motion is considered. The reported simulation results fully confirm the soundness of the approach and its superior performance over more consolidated solutions in increasing the information gain during the estimation task."
icra,None,Optimization of ultrasound image quality via visual servoing,"Pierre Chatelain,Alexandre Krupa,Nassir Navab,","In this paper we propose a new ultrasound-based visual servoing framework, for the optimization of the positioning of an ultrasound probe manipulated by a robotic arm, in order to improve the quality of the acquired ultrasound images. To this end, we use the recent framework of ultrasound confidence map, which aims at estimating the perpixel quality of the ultrasound signal based on a model of sound propagation in soft tissues. More specifically, we treat the ultrasound confidence maps as a new modality to design a visual servoing control law for image quality optimization. The proposed framework aims at improving ultrasound imaging techniques, such as robotic tele-echography, target tracking or volume reconstruction. Here we illustrate our approach with the application of robotic tele-echography. Experiments are performed on both an ultrasound examination training phantom and ex vivo tissue samples."
icra,None,Plane estimation by active vision from point features and image moments,"Riccardo Spica,Paolo Robuffo Giordano,François Chaumette,","In this paper we experimentally validate and compare three different methods for estimating the 3D parameters of a planar scene from a (possibly time-varying) set of feature points acquired by a moving monocular camera. The first method, based on the classical decomposition of the homography matrix, is meant to serve as a baseline condition classically used in many previous works. The other two methods exploit an active Structure from Motion (SfM) scheme for either extracting the plane from the reconstructed 3D position of all the tracked points, or for directly estimating the plane parameters by considering a set of discrete image moments as visual input. The possible loss/gain of point features during the camera motion is considered in all three methods by, in particular, introducing a suitable weighting strategy for the image moment case. Finally, the results of an experimental validation are presented with a comparative discussion of the pros/cons of the three methods."
icra,None,Servoing across object instances: Visual servoing for object category,"Harit Pandya,K. Madhava Krishna,C. V. Jawahar,","Traditional visual servoing is able to navigate a robotic system between two views of the same object. However, it is not designed to servo between views of different objects. In this paper, we consider a novel problem of servoing any instance (exemplar) of an object category to a desired pose (view) and propose a strategy to accomplish the task. We use features that semantically encode the locations of object parts and define the servoing error as the difference between positions of corresponding parts in the image space. Our controller is based on the linear combination of 3D models, such that the resulting model interpolates between the given and desired instances. We conducted our experiments on five different object categories in simulation framework and show that our approach achieves the desired pose with smooth trajectory. Furthermore, we show the performance gain achieved by using a linear combination of models (instances) vis a vis a controller that switches across models during servoing in terms of trajectory's length, smoothness and error in camera pose and image features."
icra,None,Direct visual servoing based on multiple intensity histograms,"Quentin Bateux,Eric Marchand,","Classically Visual servoing considered the regulation in the image of a set of visual features (usually geometric features). Recently direct visual servoing scheme, such as photometric visual servoing, have been introduced in order to consider every pixel of the image as a primary source of information and thus avoid the extraction and the tracking of such geometric features. Previous works proposed methods to use directly the image intensities in the definition of the control law, by using for example mutual information. In this paper, we propose a method to extend these works by using a global descriptor, namely intensity histograms, on the whole or multiple sub-sets of the images in order to achieve control of a 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) robot. The results are then demonstrated through experimental validations."
icra,None,Hybrid automatic visual servoing scheme using defocus information for 6-DoF micropositioning,"Le Cui,Eric Marchand,Sinan Haliyo,Stéphane Régnier,","Direct photometric visual servoing uses only the pure image information as a visual feature, instead of using classic geometric features such as points or lines. It was demonstrated efficiently in 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) positioning. However, in micro-scale, using only image intensity as a visual feature performs unsatisfactorily in cases where the photometric variation is low, such as motions along vision sensor's focal axis under a high magnification. In order to improve the performance and accuracy in those cases, an approach using hybrid visual features is proposed in this paper. Image gradient is employed as a visual feature on z axis while image intensity is used on the other 5 DoFs to control the motion. A 6-DoF micro-positioning task is accomplished by this hybrid visual servoing scheme. The experimental results obtained on a parallel positioning micro-stage under a digital microscope show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method."

Different prediction and correction methods have already been proposed in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to compare and experimentally validate some of these methods for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand configurations. In particular, we show that a correction based both on the image and the camera/target pose provides the best results."
icra,None,An improved modelling scheme for photometric moments with inclusion of spatial weights for visual servoing with partial appearance/disappearance,"Manikandan Bakthavatchalam,François Chaumette,Omar Tahri,","Visual servoing based on photometric data is of great interest since it does not necessitate any image processing or visual tracking steps. A vital issue in such methods is the change in the image resulting from the appearance and disappearance of portions of the scene from the camera field-of-view during the visual servo. In this paper, we propose a spatial weighting scheme to counter this problem. A general model for photometric moments that allows for inclusion of spatial weights is presented. A custom weighting function is then chosen and specific properties of its derivative are exploited in order to develop the interaction matrix in analytical form. The resultant effects on the invariance properties are discussed. Experiments have been performed to validate the visual servoing with the proposed weighting scheme on a 4 dof robot arm."
icra,None,Energy control for complex pendulums based on tracking of online computed force trajectories,"Franz Christange,Philine Donner,Martin Buss,","In this paper we propose to track online computed force trajectories to control the energy of various types of pendulum-like objects. The considered pendulum-like objects can be controlled by multiple agents and swing in different oscillation degrees of freedom. Our goal is to excite one specific oscillation, the intended oscillation, while damping all other disturbance oscillations. By approximating the intended oscillation as a simple pendulum oscillation, we can specify a desired force trajectory. Tracking of this force trajectory results in a controlled swing-up of the intended oscillation accompanied by a simultaneous damping of the disturbance oscillations. Simulation experiments with a two-agent trapezoidal pendulum show convincing control performance. A human-robot virtual reality experiment shows the transferability of the control approach to a human interaction partner. The limitations of the approach are discussed based on simulation results obtained for a single-agent double pendulum."
icra,None,Object conveyance control algorithms with spatially changeable end target location using Large-Scale Actuator Networks,"Martin Sinclair,Ioannis A. Raptis,","A class of robotic systems that is attracting increased scientific attention is Large-Scale Actuator Networks (LSANs). A potential application of actuator networks is distributed manipulation, a technique that has significant utility within the field of industrial automation. A reactive elastic surface that autonomously morphs its shape to transport an arbitrary number of objects to a target location is presented to explore this class of systems. A collection of actuators within a network are used to overcome the limitations of individual actuator elements, and results in a system that has multiple degrees-of-freedom. Experimental results and simulation data are presented to illustrate the functionality and scalability of the platform."
icra,None,Redundancy resolution for dual-arm robots inspired by human asymmetric bimanual action: Formulation and experiments,"Jinoh Lee,Pyung Hun Chang,","This paper proposes an optimization method for dual-arm robots, inspired by a study on human asymmetric bimanual action called Guiard's principle which states that when humans perform asymmetric bimanual tasks, the right hand (as the lateral preference) performs a fine motion (and force) resolution, while the left hand performs a coarse resolution. To effectively transfer the human bimanual-task knowledge to dual-arm robots, we proposed a cost function, based on task-compatibility index, which is used to set the desired motion and force resolution for each end-effector of the dual-arm according to its role in the bimanual action. Thus the right-arm posture is optimized such that the tool attached to its end-effector can exert fine motion and force. And the left-arm posture is optimized to assume a strong and dynamic structural support for the right arm action. We experimentally compare the proposed cost function against previous methods for dual-arm robots using two six degrees-of-freedom torque-controlled manipulators. The control performance, when mimicking Guiard's principle shows considerably better results."
icra,None,Task specific cooperative grasp planning for decentralized multi-robot systems,"Rajkumar Muthusamy,Charalampos P. Bechlioulis,Kostas J. Kyriakopoulos,,","Grasp planning in multi-robot systems is usually studied in a centralized setting with all robots sharing common knowledge about the overall system. Relaxing this assumption would allow multiple mobile manipulators to cooperate even without strict and precise coordination. Moreover, most typical tasks for cooperative settings, such as transporting heavy objects, require certain forces/torques to be exerted along/around particular directions, for instance, compensating for the weight of the transported object. In this paper, we propose task specific multi-robot grasp planning strategies that allow decentralized planning. Each agent plans its own actions without precise information about the other's plans. The approach is based on analysing a task specific grasp quality metric in a probabilistic context, compensating thus for the incomplete knowledge. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that task independent planning is clearly inferior when task characteristics are known and thus task specific quality measures should be used. Furthermore, the proposed decentralized planning approaches clearly outperform the baseline and show close to globally optimal performance."
icra,None,Toward image-based visual servoing for cooperative aerial manipulation,"Rafik Mebarki,Vincenzo Lippiello,Bruno Siciliano,","This paper proposes a new visual controller to endow flying manipulators with the capability of cooperatively and automatically positioning an assembly part on a visual target. We consider two VToL UAVs each equipped with a robot manipulator and a video camera. The two manipulators are rigidly connected to an assembly part, consisting of bar in this case study, that needs to be automatically placed on its target pose. The control system we propose uses the images relayed from the two onboard cameras to simultaneously control the motions of the UAVs and the manipulators to achieve the task: positioning the bar as well as respecting the closed-chain constraint. The controller evolves in the image space, thus inheriting robustness with respect to calibration errors. It takes into account the under-actuation inherent to rotary-wing aerial vehicles as well as the redundancy of the whole system. Furthermore, by leveraging image moments the 3D relative motion between the carried assembly part and the environment is controlled, thus yielding to natural and practically-relevant movements. Numerical simulations have been carried out to verify the validity of the proposed approach."
icra,None,Local online planning of coordinated manipulation motion,"Umberto Scarcia,Katharina Hertkorn,Claudio Melchiorri,Gianluca Palli,,","In this work, we deal with the problem of planning a manipulation task for a robotic system composed of at least one dexterous arm and a dexterous multi-fingered hand. The goal of the local planner is to include both, the arm and the hand, in the execution of the task in a coordinated way. This is achieved by using the workspace of the hand which is computed offline. During the online planning, the current in-hand manipulation capability is evaluated taking advantage of the dimensions of the hand workspace and considering the task itself. Dynamic weights enable the computation of the instantaneous contributions of the two subsystems on the motion of the manipulated object. The method is evaluated in simulation as well as in several experiments on the real robot."
icra,None,Extended Cooperative Task Space for manipulation tasks of humanoid robots,"H. Andy Park,C. S. George Lee,","A humanoid robot can be viewed as a constrained dynamic system with constraints imposed by manipulation tasks, locomotion tasks, and the environment. This paper focuses on dealing with constraints in the upper-body of humanoid robots for manipulation tasks that involve coordinated motion of two arms. Inspired by research on human bimanual actions in the biomechanics area, we have developed the Extended-Cooperative-Task-Space (ECTS) representation that efficiently describes various coordinated motion tasks performed by a humanoid robot. Furthermore, we present a general whole-body control framework as an optimal controller based on Gauss's principle of least constraint. We show that all the constraints imposed on a humanoid system can be handled in a unified manner. The proposed framework is verified by numerical simulations on a Hubo II+ humanoid robot model."
icra,None,Constraint Manifold Subsearch for multirobot path planning with cooperative tasks,"Glenn Wagner,Jae Il Kim,Konrad Urban,Howie Choset,","The cooperative path planning problem seeks to determine a path for a group of robots which form temporary teams to perform tasks that require multiple robots. The multi-scale effects of simultaneously coordinating many robots distributed across the workspace while also tightly coordinating robots in cooperative teams increases the difficulty of planning. This paper describes a new approach to cooperative path planning called Constraint Manifold Subsearch (CMS). CMS builds upon M*, a high performance multirobot path planning algorithm, by modifying the search space to restrict teams of robots performing a task to the constraint manifold of the task. CMS can find optimal solutions to the cooperative path planning problem, or near optimal solutions to problems involving large numbers of robots."

Robots represent a promising educational tool with potentially large impact, due to their broad appeal and wide relevance; however, many existing educational robot platforms have cost as a barrier to widespread use. Here we present AERobot, a simple low-cost robot that can be easily used for introductory programming and robotics teaching, starting from a primary or middle school level. The hardware is open-source and can be built for ~$10 per robot, making it possible for each student to have (and keep) their own robot, while still encompassing a rich sensor suite enabling a variety of activities. A free, open-source graphical programming environment allows students without previous programming experience to command the robot. We report on the results of three sessions of a one-week pilot course held in the summer of 2014 by STEM summer camp i2 Camp."

However, there has been no study yet that benchmarks the effectiveness of robots with respect to traditional playtools found inside a classroom, such as pretend play items and blocks. This paper presents the design, development and testing of robotic puppets, which would be used to support teaching in kindergarten education. Different types of robotic puppet design were considered before settling on a glove-type puppet. To benchmark the robot performance, a total of 52 five year-old children were observed, from which quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The result of the study indicates that when playing with the robotic puppets, the performance of the children with respect to thinking and learning, creativity and imagination, and social interaction and independence, is comparable to other traditional playtools."

Over 100 origami flowers are actuated with LEDs and printed pouch motors, and are deployed in a modular array around additional swimming and crawling folded robots. The garden integrates state-of-the-art rapid design and fabrication technologies with distributed systems software techniques to create a scalable swarm in which robots can be controlled individually or as a group.

icra,None,An emotion recognition comparative study of autistic and typically-developing children using the zeno robot,"Michelle J. Salvador,Sophia Silver,Mohammad H. Mahoor,","In this paper we present the results of our recent study on comparing the emotion expression recognition abilities of children diagnosed with high functioning Autism (ASD) with those of typically developing (TD) children through use of a humanoid robot, Zeno. In our study we investigated the effect of incorporating gestures to the emotion expression prediction accuracy of both child groups. Although the idea that ASD individuals suffer from general emotion recognition deficits is widely assumed [1], we found no significant impairment in the general emotion prediction. However, a specific deficit in correctly identifying Fear was found for children with Autism when compared to the TD children. Furthermore, we found that gestures can significantly impact the prediction accuracy of both ASD and TD children in a negative or positive manner depending on the specific expression. Thus, the use of gestures for conveying emotional expressions by a humanoid robot in a social skill therapy setting is relevant. The methodology and experimental protocol are presented and additional discussion of the Zeno R-50 robot used is given."

In this paper we describe the Fable modular robotic system for creative learning which we develop to enable and motivate anyone to build and program their own robots. The Fable system consists of self-contained modules equipped with sensors and actuators, which users can use to easily assemble a wide range of robots in a matter of seconds. The robots are user-programmable on several levels of abstraction ranging from a simple visual programming language to powerful conventional ones.

icra,None,Retrieving experience: Interactive instance-based learning methods for building robot companions,"Hae Won Park,Ayanna M. Howard,","A robot companion should adapt to its user's needs by learning to perform new tasks. In this paper, we present a robot playmate that learns and adapts to tasks chosen by the child on a touchscreen tablet. We aim to solve the task learning problem using an experience-based learning framework that stores human demonstrations as task instances. These instances are retrieved when confronted with a similar task in which the system generates predictions of task behaviors based on prior actions. In order to automate the processes of instance encoding, acquisition, and retrieval, we have developed a framework that gathers task knowledge through interaction with human teachers. This approach, further referred to as interactive instance-based learning (IIBL), utilizes limited information available to the robot to generate similarity metrics for retrieving instances. In this paper, we focus on introducing and evaluating a new hybrid IIBL framework using sensitivity analysis with artificial neural networks and discuss its advantage over methods using k-NNs and linear regression in retrieving instances."
icra,None,A bidirectional invariant representation of motion for gesture recognition and reproduction,"Raffaele Soloperto,Matteo Saveriano,Dongheui Lee,","Human action representation, recognition and learning is of importance to guarantee a fruitful human-robot cooperation. In this paper, we propose a novel coordinate-free, scale invariant representation of 6D (position and orientation) motion trajectories. The advantages of the proposed invariant representation are twofold. First the performance of gesture recognition can be improved thanks to its invariance to different viewpoints and different body sizes of the actors. Secondly, the proposed representation is bi-directional. Not only the original Cartesian trajectory can be converted into the 6 invariant values, but also the motion in the original space can be retrieved back from the invariants. While the former aspect handles robust human gesture recognition, the latter allows the execution of robot motions without the need to store the Cartesian data. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed invariant representation for gesture recognition and accurate trajectory reconstruction."
icra,None,Including human factors for planning comfortable paths,"Yoichi Morales,Atsushi Watanabe,Florent Ferreri,Jani Even,Tetsushi Ikeda,,,,","This work proposes a Human-Comfortable Path Planner (HCoPP) system for autonomous passenger vehicles. The aim is to create a path planner that improves the feeling of comfort of the passenger, this topic is different from collision free planning and it has not received much attention. For this purpose, in addition to the shortest distance constraint conventionally used in path planning, constraints related to relevant environmental features are introduced. For straight segments, the constraint is based on the lane-circulation pattern preferred by humans. In curved segments and intersections, the constraint takes into account the visibility. A multi-layered cost map is proposed to integrate these additional constraints. To compute the human-comfortable path, a graph search algorithm was implemented. The evaluation of the proposed approach was conducted by having 30 participants riding an autonomous robotic wheelchair. The paths computed by the proposed path planner were compared towards a state of the art shortest-distance path planner implemented in the navigation stack of ROS. Experimental results show that the paths computed by the proposed approach are perceived as more comfortable."
icra,None,Computing stable contact interface for customized surgical jigs,"Xiaoting Zhang,Ka-Chun Chan,Charlie C. L. Wang,Kwok-Chuen Wong,,","This paper presents a framework to compute stable contact interfaces for automatically designing customized jigs used in bone surgeries. Given the surface model of a bone represented by polygonal meshes, we find out a small region on the surface to be used as the interface of a customized jig so that it can be stably fixed on the bone under a directional clamping force. The variation of directions on the clamping force is allowed in our formulation. Moreover, the surface region serves as the interface of stable contact must also be disassemblable so that the jig and the bone can be separated after removing the clamping force. The analysis of stable contact is formulated on a Gaussian map by the common regions of half-spaces according to the motion restrictions. A flooding algorithm is proposed to determine those disassemblable and stable contact interfaces on the surface of a bone, where the contact surfaces are later converted into the solid model of a jig to be fabricated by additive manufacturing. Experimental tests are taken to verify the stable contact between a bone and the jig generated by our approach."
icra,None,A framework for end-user instruction of a robot assistant for manufacturing,"Kelleher R. Guerin,Colin Lea,Chris Paxton,Gregory D. Hager,","Small Manufacturing Entities (SMEs) have not incorporated robotic automation as readily as large companies due to rapidly changing product lines, complex and dexterous tasks, and the high cost of start-up. While recent low-cost robots such as the Universal Robots UR5 and Rethink Robotics Baxter are more economical and feature improved programming interfaces, based on our discussions with manufacturers further incorporation of robots into the manufacturing work flow is limited by the ability of these systems to generalize across tasks and handle environmental variation. Our goal is to create a system designed for small manufacturers that contains a set of capabilities useful for a wide range of tasks, is both powerful and easy to use, allows for perceptually grounded actions, and is able to accumulate, abstract, and reuse plans that have been taught. We present an extension to Behavior Trees that allows for representing the system capabilities of a robot as a set of generalizable operations that are exposed to an end-user for creating task plans. We implement this framework in CoSTAR, the Collaborative System for Task Automation and Recognition, and demonstrate its effectiveness with two case studies. We first perform a complex tool-based object manipulation task in a laboratory setting. We then show the deployment of our system in an SME where we automate a machine tending task that was not possible with current off the shelf robots."
icra,None,Fast target prediction of human reaching motion for cooperative human-robot manipulation tasks using time series classification,"Claudia Pérez-D'Arpino,Julie A. Shah,","Interest in human-robot coexistence, in which humans and robots share a common work volume, is increasing in manufacturing environments. Efficient work coordination requires both awareness of the human pose and a plan of action for both human and robot agents in order to compute robot motion trajectories that synchronize naturally with human motion. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that synthesizes anticipatory knowledge of both human motions and subsequent action steps in order to predict in real-time the intended target of a human performing a reaching motion. Motion-level anticipatory models are constructed using multiple demonstrations of human reaching motions. We produce a library of motions from human demonstrations, based on a statistical representation of the degrees of freedom of the human arm, using time series analysis, wherein each time step is encoded as a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach through offline statistical analysis of human motion data. The results indicate a considerable improvement over prior techniques in early prediction, achieving 70% or higher correct classification on average for the first third of the trajectory (<; 500msec). We also indicate proof-of-concept through the demonstration of a human-robot cooperative manipulation task performed with a PR2 robot. Finally, we analyze the quality of task-level anticipatory knowledge required to improve prediction performance early in the human motion trajectory."

Shah,","Mobile, interactive robots that operate in human-centric environments need the capability to safely and efficiently navigate around humans. This requires the ability to sense and predict human motion trajectories and to plan around them. In this paper, we present a study that supports the existence of statistically significant biomechanical turn indicators of human walking motions. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these turn indicators as features in the prediction of human motion trajectories. Human motion capture data is collected with predefined goals to train and test a prediction algorithm. Use of anticipatory features results in improved performance of the prediction algorithm. Lastly, we demonstrate the closed-loop performance of the prediction algorithm using an existing algorithm for motion planning within dynamic environments. The anticipatory indicators of human walking motion can be used with different prediction and/or planning algorithms for robotics; the chosen planning and prediction algorithm demonstrates one such implementation for human-robot co-navigation."
icra,None,Pedaling assistive control method of cycling wheelchair for hemiplegia patients,"Aya Kaisumi,Yasuhisa Hirata,Kazuhiro Kosuge,","The cycling wheelchair is a new type of mobility aid for lower-limb-disabled individuals. Patients can drive the cycling wheelchair by pressing the front pedals with their lower limbs. The device enables patients to effectively rehabilitate their disabled legs and partake in outdoor activities. However, lower-limb-disabled individuals cannot move both legs with equal ease. Typical hemiplegia patients can voluntarily move their healthy leg, but not their disabled leg. Consequently, some of these individuals pedal the cycling wheelchair mainly with their healthy leg, leading to overuse of the limb during their daily activities. This study proposes a pedaling assistive control method that adjusts the different capabilities of the healthy and disabled legs of hemiplegia patients. The proposed control method was applied to a cycling wheelchair with a servo motor for power assist. In experiments, the proposed method reduced the work required for pedaling in two common environments; a planar floor and an upward inclined surface."
icra,None,Multi-joint soft exosuit for gait assistance,"Alan T. Asbeck,Kai Schmidt,Ignacio Galiana,Diana Wagner,Conor J. Walsh,","Exosuits represent a new approach for applying assistive forces to an individual, using soft textiles to interface to the wearer and transmit forces through specified load paths. In this paper we present a body-worn, multi-joint soft exosuit that assists both ankle plantar flexion and hip flexion through a multiarticular load path, and hip extension through a separate load path, at walking speeds up to 1.79m/s (4.0mph). The exosuit applies forces of 300N in the multiarticular load path and 150N in hip extension, which correspond to torques of 21% and 19% of the nominal biological moments at the ankle and hip during unloaded walking. The multi-joint soft exosuit uses a new actuation approach that exploits joint synergies, with one motor actuating the multiarticular load paths on both legs and one motor actuating the hip extension load paths on both legs, in order to reduce the total system weight. Control is accomplished by an algorithm that uses only a gyroscope at the heel and a load cell monitoring the suit tension, and is shown to adapt within a single step to changes in cadence. Additionally, the control algorithm can create slack in the suit during non-level-ground walking motions such as stepping over obstacles so that the system can be transparent to the wearer when required. The resulting system consumes 137W, and has a mass of 6.5kg including batteries."
icra,None,“Hold-and-manipulate” with a single hand being assisted by wearable extra fingers,"Faye Y. Wu,H. Harry Asada,","Functionality of a human hand can be augmented with extra robotic fingers attached to the forearm. These wearable extra fingers can work together with the human fingers and perform tasks that are usually difficult for a single hand. Such technology may benefit amputees and surviving stroke patients who are forced to live with only one functional arm. In this paper, we present a novel method, exploiting redundancies in the elbow, to control a pair of extra robotic fingers, termed Supernumerary Robotic Fingers or SR Fingers for short, to perform “hold-and-manipulate” tasks. Two control protocols are explored here. One protocol enables discrete transition between different modes of motion, while the other continuously controls grasping behavior of the SR Fingers. Four robot assisted “hold-and-manipulate” tasks are examined, including twisting off the cap of a water bottle, opening the lid of a food container, plugging a cable into an electronic device, and mixing salad in a bowl. Through the successful completion of these tasks, we demonstrate that wearable extra fingers have the potential to provide those with impaired hands the opportunity to live with more independence and work more productively."

With these tools, we measure the current state of the ecosystem as well as determine where the community should direct their efforts. We also encourage the community to provide input on potential applications, additional metrics, and further improvements to address the needs of the ROS ecosystem. We incentivize this input by gamifying community contributions to the infrastructure. Encouraging user-driven improvements to the ROS infrastructure through the use of a leaderboard and friendly competition will advance ROS development and community support far into the future."
icra,None,TriggerSync: A time synchronisation tool,"Andrew English,Patrick Ross,David Ball,Ben Upcroft,Peter Corke,","This paper presents a framework for synchronising multiple triggered sensors with respect to a local clock using standard computing hardware. Providing sensor measurements with accurate and meaningful timestamps is important for many sensor fusion, state estimation and control applications. Accurately synchronising sensor timestamps can be performed with specialised hardware, however, performing sensor synchronisation using standard computing hardware and non-real-time operating systems is difficult due to inaccurate and temperature sensitive clocks, variable communication delays and operating system scheduling delays. Results show the ability of our framework to estimate time offsets to sub-millisecond accuracy. We also demonstrate how synchronising timestamps with our framework results in a tenfold reduction in image stabilisation error for a vehicle driving on rough terrain. The source code will be released as an open source tool for time synchronisation in ROS."
icra,None,The Affordance Template ROS package for robot task programming,"Stephen Hart,Paul Dinh,Kimberly Hambuchen,","This paper introduces the Affordance Template ROS package for quickly programming, adjusting, and executing robot applications in the ROS RViz environment. This package extends the capabilities of RViz interactive markers [1] by allowing an operator to specify multiple end-effector waypoint locations and grasp poses in object-centric coordinate frames and to adjust these waypoints in order to meet the run-time demands of the task (specifically, object scale and location). The Affordance Template package stores task specifications in a robot-agnostic JSON description format such that it is trivial to apply a template to a new robot. As such, the Affordance Template package provides a robot-generic ROS tool appropriate for building semi-autonomous, manipulation-based applications. Affordance Templates were developed by the NASA-JSC DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) team and have since successfully been deployed on multiple platforms including the NASA Valkyrie and Robonaut 2 humanoids, the University of Texas Dreamer robot and the Willow Garage PR2. In this paper, the specification and implementation of the affordance template package is introduced and demonstrated through examples for wheel (valve) turning, pick-and-place, and drill grasping, evincing its utility and flexibility for a wide variety of robot applications."
icra,None,PX4: A node-based multithreaded open source robotics framework for deeply embedded platforms,"Lorenz Meier,Dominik Honegger,Marc Pollefeys,","We present a novel, deeply embedded robotics middleware and programming environment. It uses a multithreaded, publish-subscribe design pattern and provides a Unix-like software interface for micro controller applications. We improve over the state of the art in deeply embedded open source systems by providing a modular and standards-oriented platform. Our system architecture is centered around a publish-subscribe object request broker on top of a POSIX application programming interface. This allows to reuse common Unix knowledge and experience, including a bash-like shell. We demonstrate with a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) use case that the system modularity is well suited for novel and experimental vehicle platforms. We also show how the system architecture allows a direct interface to ROS and to run individual processes either as native ROS nodes on Linux or nodes on the micro controller, maximizing interoperability. Our microcontroller-based execution environment has substantially lower latency and better hardware connectivity than a typical Robotics Linux system and is therefore well suited for fast, high rate control tasks."
icra,None,Map API - scalable decentralized map building for robots,"Titus Cieslewski,Simon Lynen,Marcin Dymczyk,Stéphane Magnenat,,","Large scale, long-term, distributed mapping is a core challenge to modern field robotics. Using the sensory output of multiple robots and fusing it in an efficient way enables the creation of globally accurate and consistent metric maps. To combine data from multiple agents into a global map, most existing approaches use a central entity that collects and manages the information from all agents. Often, the raw sensor data of one robot needs to be made available to processing algorithms on other agents due to the lack of computational resources on that robot. Unfortunately, network latency and low bandwidth in the field limit the generality of such an approach and make multi-robot map building a tedious task. In this paper, we present a distributed and decentralized back-end for concurrent and consistent robotic mapping. We propose a set of novel approaches that reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the effectiveness of inter-robot communication for distributed mapping. Instead of locking access to the map during operations, we define a version control system which allows concurrent and consistent access to the map data. Updates to the map are then shared asynchronously with agents which previously registered notifications. A technique for data lookup is provided by state-of-the-art algorithms from distributed computing. We validate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

This work introduces a novel whole body control library called OpenSoT. OpenSoT is combined with joint impedance control to create a framework that can effectively generate complex whole body motion behaviors for humanoids according to the needs of the interaction level of the tasks. OpenSoT gives an easy way to implement tasks, constraints, bounds and solvers by providing common interfaces. We present the mathematical foundation of the library and validate it on the compliant humanoid robot COMAN to execute multiple motion tasks under a number of constraints.

icra,None,SELECTSCRIPT: A query language for robotic world models and simulations,"André Dietrich,Sebastian Zug,Jörg Kaiser,","We introduce a new declarative language called SELECTSCRIPT. As its name suggests, it is a scripting language inspired primarily by SQL and its relational algebra. It is intended to be used for complex queries on different kinds of world models. Scripts can be dynamically generated and executed, or embedded into the code of foreign programming languages. A first interpreter was therefore developed for Python. Adapting the ideas of language-oriented programming, which enables developers to create their own domain-specific language, we developed a language stub that can be easily adapted and extended to comply with any (discrete) robotic world model or robotic simulator. We will further show how simple SELECT-statements can be used to extract any kind of valuable information in various return formats, thereby going beyond traditional SQL capabilities."

Our work is motivated by the potential impact of realistic simulators on the development cycle of software for real robots. The case is made for building models from approximate state information, relieving the burden of ground truth. Unlike calibration, where the goal is to identify and remove error from a signal, our aim to reproduce the signal in its entirety, including its error properties. Instead of physically modeling sensor behavior, a data-driven approach is taken. The implementation of our approach to simulate a simple but noisy laser rangefinder is described. Finally, approaches to validate the simulator are discussed. We compare not only raw sensor predictions, but also overall performance of algorithms on simulated versus real data."
icra,None,"Biped gait controller for large speed variations, combining reflexes and a central pattern generator in a neuromuscular model","Nicolas Van der Noot,Auke J. Ijspeert,Renaud Ronsse,","Controllers based on neuromuscular models hold the promise of energy-efficient and human-like walkers. However, most of them rely on optimizations or cumbersome hand-tuning to find controller parameters which, in turn, are usually working for a specific gait or forward speed only. Consequently, designing neuromuscular controllers for a large variety of gaits is usually challenging and highly sensitive. In this contribution, we propose a neuromuscular controller combining reflexes and a central pattern generator able to generate gaits across a large range of speeds, within a single optimization. Applying this controller to the model of COMAN, a 95 cm tall humanoid robot, we were able to get energy-efficient gaits ranging from 0.4 m/s to 0.9 m/s. This covers normal human walking speeds once scaled to the robot height. In the proposed controller, the robot speed could be continuously commanded within this range by changing three high-level parameters as linear functions of the target speed. This allowed large speed transitions with no additional tuning. By combining reflexes and a central pattern generator, this approach can also predict when the next strike will occur and modulate the step length to step over a hole."
icra,None,Planning COM trajectory with variable height and foot position with reactive stepping for humanoid robots,"Kirill Van Heerden,","This paper presents a trajectory generator for humanoid robots that can simultaneously consider 3D position tracking of the center-of-mass (COM), reactive stepping (foot positions are non-constant), zero-moment-point (ZMP) constraints as well as position constraints. The variable COM height leads to nonlinear ZMP constraints. This work demonstrates that depending on how strict the constraints are, it is possible to generate 1.6 second long trajectories in less than 5 ms on a 3.4 Ghz CPU. This is done by expressing the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) and solving it via sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Computation time is improved by providing the analytical derivatives of all constraints. In particular the nonlinear ZMP constraint is expressed in a quadratic form and its derivative is provided."
icra,None,Adapting human motions to humanoid robots through time warping based on a general motion feasibility index,"Yu Zheng,Katsu Yamane,","Having human-like motions will make humanoid robots more predictable and safer for the people around them. An effective way to realize this would be to use human motions as reference. Due to different kinematic and dynamic properties between humans and humanoid robots, however, a human motion could be physically infeasible for a robot and cause the robot to fall over. Therefore, it is necessary to modify and adapt an infeasible human motion to the robot. This paper presents a method for adapting human motions to humanoid robots based on a technique called time warping, which modifies the time line of a reference motion to speed up or slow down the motion. By doing this, the velocity and acceleration profiles of the motion are changed and it is possible to turn an infeasible motion into a feasible one. The optimal time warping is obtained through a generalized motion feasibility index that quantifies the feasibility of a motion considering the friction and center-of-pressure constraints. Thanks to the generality of the index, the proposed motion adaptation method can be applied to motions on arbitrary terrains or number of links in contact with the environment. Through dynamics simulation, we demonstrate that the method facilitates the reproduction of human motions on a humanoid robot."
icra,None,Contact-consistent elastic strips for multi-contact locomotion planning of humanoid robots,"Shu-Yun Chung,Oussama Khatib,","This paper presents the contact-consistent elastic strips (CES) framework, a motion planning approach capable of producing complex multi-contact whole-body humanoid behaviors in dynamic environments. Planning multi-contact motions for humanoid robots is known to be non-trivial since it involves aspects of autonomous balancing, obstacle avoidance, ensuring global connectivity of the workspace and concurrent consideration of the kinematic and dynamic constraints. Previous works at motion planning for humanoid systems tend to focus on joint space planning and deal with obstacle avoidance and contact-point searching as the separated problems. CES framework, however, simultaneously considers all these requirements and constraints in task space while planning a valid sequence of contact-points and corresponding motions. This resulted in considerable improvements to efficiency and significantly reduced planning time. With the use of CES framework, complex multi-contact locomotion behaviors and real-time adjustments to the robot motions in 3D unstructured environments is possible. Several simulations are demonstrated to evaluate and verify the performance of CES framework."
icra,None,Two steps is enough: No need to plan far ahead for walking balance,"Petr Zaytsev,S. Javad Hasaneini,Andy Ruina,","Before designing a controller in detail, we ask this question: for a given robot state, and every possible control action, what is the minimum number of steps needed to get to a given target state (if it is possible to do so)? Our biped model is a 2D inverted pendulum with massless legs. We have two controls: (i) the magnitude of an impulsive push-off just before heel-strike and (ii) the step length (location of the next heel-strike). The maximum impulse and minimum step time are bounded to reflect limited motor strength. We compute the set of initial mid-stance velocities from which the biped can reach a given target mid-stance velocity in n or fewer steps. The result: for most target speeds and initial velocities, and with realistically strong actuators, it is possible to reach the target in two steps, if it is possible to reach it at all. This `two steps is enough' result expands on Koolen et al.'s [1] results for capturability of the linear inverted pendulum and is consistent with some human balance and visual guidance experiments."
icra,None,A robotic bipedal model for human walking with slips,"Kuo Chen,Mitja Trkov,Jingang Yi,Yizhai Zhang,Tao Liu,Dezhen Song,","Slip is the major cause of falls in human locomotion. We present a new bipedal modeling approach to capture and predict human walking locomotion with slips. Compared with the existing bipedal models, the proposed slip walking model includes the human foot rolling effects, the existence of the double-stance gait and active ankle joints. One of the major developments is the relaxation of the nonslip assumption that is used in the existing bipedal models. We conduct extensive experiments to optimize the gait profile parameters and to validate the proposed walking model with slips. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully predicts the human recovery gaits with slips."
icra,None,Robust spring mass model running for a physical bipedal robot,"William C. Martin,Albert Wu,Hartmut Geyer,","The analysis of the conceptual spring mass model for running reveals swing-leg placement policies that generate very robust locomotion in unobserved terrain with large changes in ground height. However, while this theoretical result suggests a potential for large improvements on the robustness of running machines, it has so far not been demonstrated on a physical robot. Here we address this implementation and verification step for a human-sized bipedal robot platform confined to a boom. We detail challenges and solutions for the implementation of the control approach and show that it leads to very robust running (ground changes ±20% of leg length) over unobserved ground in a high fidelity simulation of the robot platform. We also present initial tests on the actual robot hardware, which indicate the feasibility of the approach. If it can be generalized to 3D running, it could trigger running machines with largely improved robustness."
icra,None,Mimicking human walking with 5-link model using HZD controller,"Maziar Ahmad Sharbafi,Andre Seyfarth,","Walking with 5-link model has been achieved by HZD (Hybrid Zero Dynamics) controller based on virtual constraints. These holonomic constraints are obtained by optimizing a set of virtual relations (e.g., Beziér polynomial) between system states which mostly do not have physical interpretations. In this paper, the virtual constraints are designed using human walking experiment data. Inspiring from human locomotion, different polynomials are extracted to mimic human joint angles patterns during walking. The virtual leg angle is the increasing variable which synchronize the joints angles and defines the virtual constraints. Simulation results show that stable locomotion with leg and upper-body behavior similar to human experiment data is achieved for a wide range of speeds and body configuration parameters. VPP (Virtual Pivot Point) concept, a significant balancing feature found in human/animal locomotion, is investigated for different gait speeds as a performance index to compare the kinetic behavior of the simulated and human walking. Hence, we present human-like posture control as an outcome of motion control achieved by HZD with human inspired virtual constraints."
icra,None,Viewpoint simulation for camera pose estimation from an unstructured scene model,"Pierre Rolin,Marie-Odile Berger,Frédéric Sur,","We consider the problem of camera pose estimation from a scene model obtained beforehand by a structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithm. The model is made of 3D points, each one of them being represented by its coordinates and a set of photometric descriptors such as SIFT, extracted from some of the input images of the SfM stage. Pose estimation is based on the matching of interest points from a test view with model points, using the descriptors. Descriptors having a limited invariance with respect to viewpoint changes, such an approach is likely to fail when the test view is far away from the images used to construct the model. Viewpoint simulation techniques, as ASIFT, have proved effective for wide-baseline image matching. This paper explores how these techniques can enrich a scene model by adding descriptors from simulated views, using either orthographic or pinhole virtual cameras. Viewpoint simulation permits pose estimation in situations where the approach based on the sole SIFT descriptors simply fails."
icra,None,Towards life-long visual localization using an efficient matching of binary sequences from images,"Roberto Arroyo,Pablo F. Alcantarilla,Luis M. Bergasa,Eduardo Romera,","Life-long visual localization is one of the most challenging topics in robotics over the last few years. The difficulty of this task is in the strong appearance changes that a place suffers due to dynamic elements, illumination, weather or seasons. In this paper, we propose a novel method (ABLE-M) to cope with the main problems of carrying out a robust visual topological localization along time. The novelty of our approach resides in the description of sequences of monocular images as binary codes, which are extracted from a global LDB descriptor and efficiently matched using FLANN for fast nearest neighbor search. Besides, an illumination invariant technique is applied. The usage of the proposed binary description and matching method provides a reduction of memory and computational costs, which is necessary for long-term performance. Our proposal is evaluated in different life-long navigation scenarios, where ABLE-M outperforms some of the main state-of-the-art algorithms, such as WI-SURF, BRIEF-Gist, FAB-MAP or SeqSLAM. Tests are presented for four public datasets where a same route is traversed at different times of day or night, along the months or across all four seasons."
icra,None,An iterative Kalman smoother for robust 3D localization on mobile and wearable devices,"Dimitrios G. Kottas,Stergios I. Roumeliotis,","In this paper, we introduce an Iterative Kalman Smoother (IKS) for tracking the 3D motion of a mobile device in real-time using visual and inertial measurements. In contrast to existing Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based approaches, smoothing can better approximate the underlying nonlinear system and measurement models by re-linearizing them. Additionally, by iteratively optimizing over all measurements available, the IKS increases the convergence rate of critical parameters (e.g., IMU-camera clock drift) and improves the positioning accuracy during challenging conditions (e.g., scarcity of visual features). Furthermore, and in contrast to existing inverse filters, the proposed IKS's numerical stability allows for efficient 32-bit implementations on resource-constrained devices, such as cell phones and wearables. We validate the IKS for performing vision-aided inertial navigation on Google Glass, a wearable device with limited sensing and processing, and demonstrate positioning accuracy comparable to that achieved on cell phones. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first proof-of-concept real-time 3D indoor localization system on a commercial-grade wearable computer."
icra,None,Omnidirectional-vision-based estimation for containment detection of a robotic mower,"Junho Yang,Soon-Jo Chung,Seth Hutchinson,David Johnson,Michio Kise,","In this paper, we present an omnidirectional-vision-based localization and mapping system which can detect whether a robotic mower is contained in a permitted area. We exploit a robot-centric mapping framework that exploits a differential equation of motion of the landmarks, which are referenced with respect to the robot body frame. The estimator in our system generates a 3D point-based map with landmarks. Concurrently, the estimator defines a boundary of the mowing area with the estimated trajectory of the mower. The estimated boundary and the landmark map are provided for the estimation of the mowing location and for the containment detection. We validate the effectiveness of our system through numerical simulations and present the results of the outdoor experiment that we conducted with our robotic mower."
icra,None,Fast Monte Carlo Localization using spatial density information,"Renan Maffei,Vitor A. M. Jorge,Vitor F. Rey,Mariana Kolberg,Edson Prestes,","Estimating the robot localization is a fundamental requirement for applications in robotics. For many years, Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) has been one of the most popular approaches to solve the global localization when using range finders, like sonars or lasers. It generally weights the estimates about the robot state by comparing raw sensor readings with simulated readings computed for each estimate. In this paper, we propose an observation model for localization that associates a kernel density estimate (KDE) to each point in the space. This single-valued density measure is independent of orientation, what allows an efficient pre-caching step, substantially boosting the computation time of the process. Using the gradient of the densities field, our strategy is able to estimate orientation information that helps to restrict the localization search space. Additionally, we can combine densities obtained by kernels of different sizes and profiles to improve the quality of the acquired information. We show through experiments in comparison with traditional approaches that our method is efficient, even working with large sets of particles, and effective."
icra,None,Unsupervised part-based scene modeling for visual robot localization,"Tanaka Kanji,","Scene modeling is an important first stage in visual robot localization. In recent years, the bag-of-words (BoW) scene modeling approach has attracted considerable attention as a method for obtaining compact discriminative scene descriptors for map retrieval. However, a BoW scene descriptor alone cannot address partial view changes and often produces poor localization in practice. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a simple effective approach, “unsupervised part-based scene modeling,” in which a set of useful parts is discovered via scene parsing and the parts are used as additional queries for the map retrieval. We also address the issue of discovering useful parts in a scene, and present a solution that provides similar parts for similar scenes. The next contribution of this work is that we present a practical robot self-localization system that consists of three distinct steps: (1) robust hierarchical scene parsing to obtain multiple scene/part queries, (2) saliency-based selection of useful parts, and (3) aggregation of ranking results from multiple scene/part queries to obtain a reliable ranking result. For rank aggregation, we consider multiple search engines for multiple part queries and adopt the idea of unsupervised rank fusion. Experimental results obtained using a challenging outdoor scene dataset show that our approach is an improvement over previous approaches despite the fact that we do not rely on domain-specific scene/part models nor supervision."
icra,None,FARLAP: Fast robust localisation using appearance priors,"Geoffrey Pascoe,Will Maddern,Alexander D. Stewart,Paul Newman,","This paper is concerned with large-scale localisation at city scales with monocular cameras. Our primary motivation lies with the development of autonomous road vehicles - an application domain in which low-cost sensing is particularly important. Here we present a method for localising against a textured 3-dimensional prior mesh using a monocular camera. We first present a system for generating and texturing the prior using a LIDAR scanner and camera. We then describe how we can localise against that prior with a single camera, using an information-theoretic measure of image similarity. This process requires dealing with the distortions induced by a wide-angle camera. We present and justify an interesting approach to this issue in which we distort the prior map into the image rather than vice-versa. Finally we explain how the general purpose computation functionality of a modern GPU is particularly apt for our task, allowing us to run the system in real time. We present results showing centimetre-level localisation accuracy through a city over six kilometres."
icra,None,RGBD relocalisation using pairwise geometry and concise key point sets,"Shuda Li,Andrew Calway,","We describe a novel RGBD relocalisation algorithm based on key point matching. It combines two components. First, a graph matching algorithm which takes into account the pairwise 3-D geometry amongst the key points, giving robust relocalisation. Second, a point selection process which provides an even distribution of the ‘most matchable’ points across the scene based on non-maximum suppression within voxels of a volumetric grid. This ensures a bounded set of matchable key points which enables tractable and scalable graph matching at frame rate. We present evaluations using a public dataset and our own more difficult dataset containing large pose changes, fast motion and non-stationary objects. It is shown that the method significantly out performs state-of-the-art methods."
icra,None,Robust aerial object tracking in images with lens flare,"Andreas Nussberger,Helmut Grabner,Luc Van Gool,","The goal of integrating drones into the civil airspace requires a technical system which robustly detects, tracks and finally avoids aerial objects. Electro-optical cameras have proven to be an adequate sensor to detect traffic, especially for smaller aircraft, gliders or paragliders. However the very challenging environmental conditions and image artifacts such as lens flares often result in a high number of false detections. Depending on the solar radiation lens flares are very common in aerial images and hard to distinguish from aerial objects on a collision course due to their similar size, shape, brightness and trajectories. In this paper we present an efficient method to detect lens flares within aerial images based on the position of the sun with respect to the observer. Using the date, time, position and attitude of the observer we predict the lens flare direction within the image. Once the direction is known the position, size and shape of the lens flares are extracted. Experiments show that our approach is able to compensate for errors in the parameters influencing the calculation of the lens flare direction. We further integrate the lens flare detection into an aerial object tracking framework. A detailed evaluation of the framework with and without lens flare filter shows that false tracks due to lens flares are successfully suppressed without degrading the overall tracking system performance."
icra,None,Shortest path for aerial vehicles in heterogeneous environment using RRT*,"P. Pharpatara,B. Hérissé,R. Pepy,Y. Bestaoui,","This paper presents an algorithm for aerial vehicle trajectory generation based on the optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*). The trajectory generation for the aerial vehicle is a complex path planning problem since the vehicle flies in a heterogeneous environment. The vehicle must also avoid some obstacles or inaccessible zones such as buildings, mountains and even radar detection zones depending on the mission. The RRT* algorithm is used as a basis to find near-optimal solutions for this problem. The shortest Dubins' path in heterogeneous environment is used to compute a distance and a trajectory between two vehicle states. Simulated results show the capability of the algorithm to find a feasible near-optimal trajectory in terms of path length that anticipates future flight conditions, such as the decrease in maneuverability in high altitude. The results also show the advantages over the numerical methods in avoiding obstacles."
icra,None,A streamlined nonlinear path following kinematic controller,"J. M. de la Cruz,J. A. Lopez-Orozco,E. Besada-Portas,J. Aranda-Almansa,","This paper presents a new nonlinear path-following guidance method for autonomous vehicles, which integrates two guidance laws that have given good results independently in applications in autonomous ground, marine, and air vehicles. This new technique retains the best aspects of its two supporting methods, whereas it overcomes some of their drawbacks. It uses the control law by Park et al. to command the vehicle position towards a reference point. However, the position of the reference point is controlled in a different way: instead of being calculated to stay at a fixed distance forward of the vehicle, we use a strategy, inspired in the works by other authors, that controls the speed of the reference point to maintain its position at the given distance. This change does not increment the number of parameters to tune the algorithm and makes it applicable to any initial conditions and parameterized paths. The paper also analyzes the stability of this new nonlinear guidance control law and shows its effectiveness under different simulations."
icra,None,Sense and avoid for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using ADS-B,"Yucong Lin,Srikanth Saripalli,",We present the design and implementation of an aircraft collision avoidance algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is used to detect aircraft. The UAV needs to fly through pre-assigned waypoints while avoiding collisions with other aircraft. The aircraft are indifferent to the UAV. A collision with aircraft are detected by simulating the UAV's trajectory along the path of assigned waypoints using its closed-loop dynamics. A sampling based algorithm is used for collision avoidance path planning. A second collision check is performed on the generated path with the updated UAV and aircraft's states. The path will be re-planned if it leads to a collision. The algorithm was validated in Software-In-the-Loop Simulation (SITL). ADS-B data obtained from commercial aircraft flying over the Phoenix Skyharbor airport were used for simulating the collisions. The paper shows that the algorithm enables the UAV to avoid multiple aircraft with different approaching angles and speeds.
icra,None,Decentralized simultaneous localization and mapping for multiple aerial vehicles using range-only sensors,"F.R. Fabresse,F. Caballero,A. Ollero,","This paper presents an approach for decentralized range-only simultaneous localization and mapping (RO-SLAM) of a network of aerial vehicles and a set of static range-only sensors deployed in the environment. The paper makes use of a multi-hypothesis framework developed by the authors [1] in order to deal with the multiple hypotheses that are present in the early stages of the undelayed RO-SLAM, this paper extends the approach to consider the integration of landmark estimations provided by other aerial vehicles nearby the robot. The method will enable a significant reduction in the convergence time needed to remove wrong localization hypotheses for every range-only landmark and, as a results, a map with improved accuracy. The proposed approach is validated first in simulations and later on with real experiments involving real range-only sensors and two unmanned aerial vehicles."
icra,None,Monocular image space tracking on a computationally limited MAV,"Kyel Ok,Dinesh Gamage,Tom Drummond,Frank Dellaert,Nicholas Roy,","We propose a method of monocular camera-inertial based navigation for computationally limited micro air vehicles (MAVs). Our approach is derived from the recent development of parallel tracking and mapping algorithms, but unlike previous results, we show how the tracking and mapping processes operate using different representations. The separation of representations allows us not only to move the computational load of full map inference to a ground station, but to further reduce the computational cost of on-board tracking for pose estimation. Our primary contribution is to show how the cost of tracking the vehicle pose on-board can be substantially reduced by estimating the camera motion directly in the image frame, rather than in the world co-ordinate frame. We demonstrate our method on an Ascending Technologies Pelican quad-rotor, and show that we can track the vehicle pose with reduced on-board computation but without compromised navigation accuracy."
icra,None,Structural inspection path planning via iterative viewpoint resampling with application to aerial robotics,"Andreas Bircher,Kostas Alexis,Michael Burri,Philipp Oettershagen,,,,","Within this paper, a new fast algorithm that provides efficient solutions to the problem of inspection path planning for complex 3D structures is presented. The algorithm assumes a triangular mesh representation of the structure and employs an alternating two-step optimization paradigm to find good viewpoints that together provide full coverage and a connecting path that has low cost. In every iteration, the viewpoints are chosen such that the connection cost is reduced and, subsequently, the tour is optimized. Vehicle and sensor limitations are respected within both steps. Sample implementations are provided for rotorcraft and fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems. The resulting algorithm characteristics are evaluated using simulation studies as well as multiple real-world experimental test-cases with both vehicle types."
icra,None,Emergency maneuver library - ensuring safe navigation in partially known environments,"Sankalp Arora,Sanjiban Choudhury,Daniel Althoff,Sebastian Scherer,","Autonomous mobile robots are required to operate in partially known and unstructured environments. It is imperative to guarantee safety of such systems for their successful deployment. Current state of the art does not fully exploit the sensor and dynamic capabilities of a robot. Also, given the non-holonomic systems with non-linear dynamic constraints, it becomes computationally infeasible to find an optimal solution if the full dynamics are to be exploited online. In this paper we present an online algorithm to guarantee the safety of the robot through an emergency maneuver library. The maneuvers in the emergency maneuver library are optimized such that the probability of finding an emergency maneuver that lies in the known obstacle free space is maximized. We prove that the related trajectory set diversity problem is monotonic and sub-modular which enables one to develop an efficient trajectory set generation algorithm with bounded sub-optimality. We generate an off-line computed trajectory set that exploits the full dynamics of the robot and the known obstacle-free region. We test and validate the algorithm on a full-size autonomous helicopter flying up to speeds of 56 m/s in partially-known environments. We present results from 4 months of flight testing where the helicopter has been avoiding trees, performing autonomous landing, avoiding mountains while being guaranteed safe."
icra,None,Control of a 2-DOF powered ankle-foot mechanism,"Evandro M. Ficanha,Mohammad Rastgaar,Kenton R. Kaufman,","This paper describes a finite state machine to control an ankle-foot prosthesis with two degrees of freedom (DOF) in the sagittal and frontal planes. Strain gauges were installed in the foot to provide ground reaction torques feedback for impedance and admittance controllers to be used at heel-strike and push-off of the gait, respectively. The quasi-static stiffness of the ankle with the active control was measured showing a near linear relationship between the torque feedback gain and the stiffness of the ankle. The performance of the finite state machine and controllers were also evaluated using a custom-made circular treadmill and the results were compared to the results of the prosthesis using position controller and inactive controllers. The results showed that the impedance/admittance controller was capable of tracking the desired input trajectory while decreasing the required torque at the ankle joint."
icra,None,Informing ankle-foot prosthesis prescription through haptic emulation of candidate devices,"Joshua M. Caputo,Peter G. Adamczyk,Steven H. Collins,","Robotic prostheses can improve walking performance for amputees, but prescription of these devices has been hindered by their high cost and uncertainty about the degree to which individuals will benefit. The typical prescription process cannot well predict how an individual will respond to a device they have never used because it bases decisions on subjective assessment of an individual's current activity level. We propose a new approach in which individuals `test drive' candidate devices using a prosthesis emulator while their walking performance is quantitatively assessed and results are distilled to inform prescription. In this system, prosthesis behavior is controlled by software rather than mechanical implementation, so users can quickly experience a broad range of devices. To test the viability of the approach, we developed a prototype emulator and assessment protocol, leveraging hardware and methods we previously developed for basic science experiments. We demonstrated emulations across the spectrum of commercially available prostheses, including traditional (e.g. SACH), dynamic-elastic (e.g. FlexFoot), and powered robotic (e.g. BiOM ® T2) prostheses. Emulations exhibited low error with respect to reference data and provided subjectively convincing representations of each device. We demonstrated an assessment protocol that differentiated device classes for each individual based on quantitative performance metrics, providing feedback that could be used to make objective, personalized device prescriptions."

This hand matches or exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art myoelectric prosthetic hands, but costs two orders of magnitude less ($250) and is easy to manufacture with a 3D printer and off-the-shelf parts.

icra,None,A single-actuator prosthetic hand using a continuum differential mechanism,"Kai Xu,Huan Liu,Zenghui Liu,Yuheng Du,Xiangyang Zhu,","Substantial progresses have been made in building versatile anthropomorphic prosthetic hands in the past two decades using emerging technologies. However the trade-offs between functionality, reliability, affordability, appearance, etc. have not been fully settled. Many existing designs, particularly the commercial prosthetic hands, are underactuated and they can realize various grasps through compliant structures or differential mechanisms. This paper presents the design of an underactuated prosthetic hand with one actuator using a continuum differential mechanism. Structure of the continuum differential mechanism is simple enough to allow all the components, including a battery pack, to be packed into the palm. The design concept, component descriptions, and hand constructions are elaborated. Experimental verifications are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed design."
icra,None,Leg muscle activation evoked by floor stiffness perturbations: A novel approach to robot-assisted gait rehabilitation,"Jeffrey Skidmore,Panagiotis Artemiadis,","Robotic devices have been used in a variety of rehabilitation protocols, including gait rehabilitation after stroke. However, robotic intervention in gait therapy has only produced moderate results compared to conventional physiotherapy. We suggest a novel approach to robotic interventions which takes advantage of inter-limb coordination mechanisms. We hypothesize the existence of a mechanism of inter-leg coordination that may remain intact after a hemiplegic stroke that may be utilized to obtain functional improvement of the impaired leg. One of the most significant advantages of this approach is the safety of the patient, since this does not require any direct manipulation of the impaired leg. In this paper, we focus on designing and applying unilateral perturbations that evoke contralateral leg motions through mechanisms of inter-leg coordination. Real-time control of floor stiffness is utilized to uniquely differentiate force and kinematic feedback, creating novel perturbations. We present results of repeatable and scalable evoked muscle activity of the contralateral tibialis anterior muscle through unilateral stiffness perturbations. We also present a mathematical model that accurately describes the relationship between the magnitude of the stiffness perturbation and the evoked muscle activity, that could result in model-based rehabilitation strategies for impaired walkers. The novel methods and results presented in this paper set the foundation for a paradigm shift of robotic interventions for gait rehabilitation."
icra,None,Simultaneous myoelectric control of a robot arm using muscle synergy-inspired inputs from high-density electrode grids,"Mark Ison,Ivan Vujaklija,Bryan Whitsell,Dario Farina,Panagiotis Artemiadis,","Myoelectric control has seen decades of research as a potential interface between human and machines. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) non-invasively provides a rich set of signals representing underlying muscle contractions and, at a higher level, human motion intent. Many pattern recognition techniques have been proposed to predict motions based on these signals. However, control schemes incorporating pattern recognition struggle with long-term reliability due to signal stochasticity and transient changes. This study proposes an alternative approach for HDsEMG-based interfaces using concepts of motor skill learning and muscle synergies to address long-term reliability. Muscle synergy-inspired decomposition reduces HDsEMG into control inputs robust to small electrode displacements. The novel control scheme provides simultaneous and proportional control, and is learned by the subject simply by interacting with the device. In a multiple-day experiment, subjects learned to control a virtual 7-DoF myoelectric interface, displaying performance learning curves consistent with motor skill learning. On a separate day, subjects intuitively transferred this learning to demonstrate precision tasks with a 7-DoF robot arm, without requiring any recalibration. These results suggest that the proposed method may be a practical alternative to pattern recognition-based control for long-term use of myoelectric interfaces."
icra,None,Tactile proprioceptive input in robotic rehabilitation after stroke,"Emmanouil Tzorakoleftherakis,Maria C. Bengtson,Ferdinando A. Mussa-Ivaldi,,,","Stroke can lead to loss or impairment of somatosensory sensation (i.e. proprioception), that reduces functional control of limb movements. Here we examine the possibility of providing artificial feedback to make up for lost sensory information following stroke. However, it is not clear whether this kind of sensory substitution is even possible due to stroke-related loss of central processing pathways that subserve somatosensation. In this paper we address this issue in a small cohort of stroke survivors using a tracking task that emulates many activities of daily living. Artificial proprioceptive information was provided to the subjects in the form of vibrotactile cues. The goal was to assist participants in guiding their arm towards a moving target on the screen. Our experiment indicates reliable tracking accuracy under the effect of vibrotactile proprioceptive feedback, even in subjects with impaired natural proprioception. This result is promising and can create new directions in rehabilitation robotics with augmented somatosensory feedback."
icra,None,An autonomous robotic assistant for drinking,"Sebastian Schröer,Ingo Killmann,Barbara Frank,Martin Völker,Lukas Fiederer,,,","Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, among a range of other neurologic disorders, can cause chronic paralysis. Patients suffering from paralysis may remain unable to achieve even basic everyday tasks such as liquid intake. Currently, there is a great interest in developing robotic assistants controlled via brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to restore the ability to perform such tasks. This paper describes an autonomous robotic assistant for liquid intake. The components of the system include autonomous online detection both of the cup to be grasped and of the mouth of the user. It plans motions of the robot arm under the constraints that the cup stays upright while moving towards the mouth and that the cup stays in direct contact with the user's mouth while the robot tilts it during the drinking phase. To achieve this, our system also includes a technique for online estimation of the location of the user's mouth even under partial occlusions by the cup or robot arm. We tested our system in a real environment and in a shared-control setting using frequency-specific modulations recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) from the brain of the user. Our experiments demonstrate that our BMI-controlled robotic system enables a reliable liquid intake. We believe that our approach can easily be extended to other useful tasks including food intake and object manipulation."
